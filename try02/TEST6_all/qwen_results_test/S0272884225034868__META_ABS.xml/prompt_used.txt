You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Additive manufacturing of fiber-reinforced silicon carbide ceramic matrix composites: process optimization and performance control Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic materials are widely used in fields such as aerospace due to their low density, high strength, and excellent chemical stability. However, their high hardness and brittleness make them difficult to form and machine. 3D printing technology provides a new approach for the forming and manufacturing of complex-shaped SiC ceramic components. Nevertheless, 3D-printed ceramic components suffer from issues like high porosity and low mechanical strength. Fiber reinforcement is considered one of the most promising methods to enhance their mechanical properties. This paper reviews the latest research progress at home and abroad on 3D-printed fiber-reinforced SiC ceramic matrix composites (SiC-CMC). It details the types and pre-treatment methods of fibers suitable for SiC 3D printing, the 3D printing processes for discrete fiber-reinforced and continuous fiber-reinforced SiC-CMC, their application fields, and compares the mechanical properties of SiC-CMC prepared by different 3D printing technologies. The results show that for short-cut fiber-reinforced SiC-CMC prepared via 3D printing, reaction melt infiltration (RMI) is mostly adopted as a post-densification treatment method, which significantly improves the bending strength. However, different 3D printing processes have their own advantages and disadvantages and are suitable for different fields. Continuous fiber-reinforced SiC-CMC exhibits significantly higher fracture toughness compared to short-cut fiber-reinforced SiC-CMC. Moreover, the fibers in continuous fiber-reinforced SiC-CMC show a clear directional arrangement, which can increase the energy consumed during crack propagation and improve fracture toughness. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively elaborate on the research status of 3D-printed fiber-reinforced SiC ceramic matrix composites and provide a reference for future research and applications in this field.
