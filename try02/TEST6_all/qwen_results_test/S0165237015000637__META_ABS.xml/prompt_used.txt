You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the co-pyrolysis of high density polyethylene and potato blends using thermogravimetric analyzer and tubular furnace The interactions between high density polyethylene (HDPE) and potato during their primary and secondary co-pyrolysis process were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a tubular furnace. Kinetic analysis has shown that the devolatilization of potato was relatively faster compared to those of cellulosic materials, which has been ascribed to the multi-side-chain structure and lower polymerization degree of starch. The pyrolysis process of potato can be divided into three stages, and the main thermal degradation took place between 178 and 378°C, while the HDPE decomposition occurred in a single stage in the temperature range of 380–517°C. In the case of blends, the weight loss differences (ΔW) between experimental and theoretical ones were less than ±8% in all cases, and the co-pyrolysis process of potato and HDPE can be described as two consecutive first order reactions, the apparent activation energies of blends were almost invariable, suggested that only physical step limitation was found in the primary co-pyrolysis process of potato and HDPE. On the contrary, the results of tubular furnace experiment showed that due to the relatively long gas resident time, the interaction occurred in the gas phase not only favored the formation of gaseous products, but also improved the bio-oil quality by significantly reducing the oxygen-to-carbon ratios (O/C) of the pyrolysis oil.
