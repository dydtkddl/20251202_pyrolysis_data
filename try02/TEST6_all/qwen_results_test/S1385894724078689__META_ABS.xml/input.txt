Degradation and physico-chemical methods of removal of chlorinated paraffins from aqueous solutions for environmental protection A wide application of chlorinated paraffins (CPs) for decades in various branches of industry and permanent increase of their productions resulted in their increasing presence in natural environment. Additionally, their extreme chemical resistance caused their inclusion several years ago into the list of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of Stockholm Convention and an increase of interest of this group of anthropogenic pollutants among toxicologist and analysts. Their removal from waters and wastewaters can be achieved by their isolation using appropriate sorbents, or degradation to analogous compounds with shorter alkane chains and/or partial elimination of chlorine atoms from the molecule using biological or chemical methods. A decomposition or complete mineralization can be achieved using thermal treatment, irradiation with UV or ionizing radiation, sonolysis, or wet processes employing especially strong reductants. All those processes were discussed in this review based on [162] literature references, mostly original research works published in chemical and environmental journals.
