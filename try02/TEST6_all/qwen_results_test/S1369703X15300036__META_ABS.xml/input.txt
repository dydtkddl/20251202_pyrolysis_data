Efficient P(3HB) extraction from Burkholderia sacchari cells using non-chlorinated solvents A technique using safer, non-chlorinated organic solvents for the extraction of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P(3HB)) from bacterial cells was developed, aiming to attain high recovery yields and purities. Some solvents were selected from the GlaxoSmithKline guide as sustainable industrial solvents and the solubility of P(3HB) calculated using predictive equations from literature. Based on the calculated solubility values, anisole, cyclohexanone and phenetole were tested as extraction solvents and the relevant process variables (extraction temperature, extraction time and mass of cells/solvent volume ratio) were addressed. Polymer recovery yields of 97% and 93% were obtained with anisole and cyclohexanone, respectively, at 120–130°C using a cell/solvent ratio of 1.5% (w/v). Maximum polymer purities using these experimental conditions were 98% for both solvents. The recovery yield and the polymer purity attained with chloroform (reference solvent) were 96 and 98%, respectively. Higher cell/solvent ratios of 6.0% (w/v) showed slightly lower recovery yields and purities. The average molecular weight and the thermal properties of the polymers extracted with the alternative solvents were fully comparable to those of the polymers obtained by chloroform extraction, demonstrating that the applied conditions did not significantly alter the properties of the extracted P(3HB).
