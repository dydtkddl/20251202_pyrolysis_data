You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient P(3HB) extraction from Burkholderia sacchari cells using non-chlorinated solvents A technique using safer, non-chlorinated organic solvents for the extraction of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P(3HB)) from bacterial cells was developed, aiming to attain high recovery yields and purities. Some solvents were selected from the GlaxoSmithKline guide as sustainable industrial solvents and the solubility of P(3HB) calculated using predictive equations from literature. Based on the calculated solubility values, anisole, cyclohexanone and phenetole were tested as extraction solvents and the relevant process variables (extraction temperature, extraction time and mass of cells/solvent volume ratio) were addressed. Polymer recovery yields of 97% and 93% were obtained with anisole and cyclohexanone, respectively, at 120–130°C using a cell/solvent ratio of 1.5% (w/v). Maximum polymer purities using these experimental conditions were 98% for both solvents. The recovery yield and the polymer purity attained with chloroform (reference solvent) were 96 and 98%, respectively. Higher cell/solvent ratios of 6.0% (w/v) showed slightly lower recovery yields and purities. The average molecular weight and the thermal properties of the polymers extracted with the alternative solvents were fully comparable to those of the polymers obtained by chloroform extraction, demonstrating that the applied conditions did not significantly alter the properties of the extracted P(3HB).
