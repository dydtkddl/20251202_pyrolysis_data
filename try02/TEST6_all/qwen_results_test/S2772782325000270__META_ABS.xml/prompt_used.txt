You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal pyrolysis of wasted high-density plastic into valuable fuels using statistically derived kinetic rate constants Experimentally, empirical rate constants are used to extract liquid fuels and gases from the thermal decomposition of high-density plastics (HDPs). However, this approach is costly, time-consuming, and not commercially viable for producing a sustainable volume of liquid fuel. The prediction of rate constants is, therefore, imperative to boost the efficiency of the scaled destruction of plastic waste into fuels and other valuable products. We used the Box-Behnken technique in response surface methodology (RSM) to forecast temperature-dependent rate constants for thermal destruction of HDP. Most appropriate combinations of activation energies (Ea), exponential factors (Ao) and rate constants (k) were predicted statistically for better insight into HDP reaction mechanism for commercial scale production of oils and gases. The predicted parameters were used in a 2nd order ordinary differential solver to simulate the amount of oil and gases. The thermal treatment of HDP under optimized conditions resulted in 99 % oil production after 240 min of reaction. The formation of heavy wax was observed at the start of the reaction, and it changed to oil, light wax, and gases after 1 hour of processing. After 2 h, light wax production declined and oil production increased over time.
