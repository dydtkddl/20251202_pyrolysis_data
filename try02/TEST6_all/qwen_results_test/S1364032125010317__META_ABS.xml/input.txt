Cryogenic cold energy storage for liquefied natural gas utilization Liquefied natural gas (LNG) possesses substantial cold energy. However, the existing utilization approaches are constrained by single method, limited temperature range, and steady operating conditions. It is challenging to adapt to fluctuations in cold energy supply, resulting in a relatively low recovery rate. Cold energy storage (CES) could eliminate the imbalance between energy supply and demand. This work aims to present a state of the art of CES materials for LNG utilization, especially for the application of cryogenic CES in the temperature range from −160 °C to −70 °C. Sensible and latent heat storage materials are summarized in terms of their development and characterization. Strategies targeting key limitations of phase change materials—poor thermal conductivity, liquid leakage, and severe subcooling—are comparatively presented. Modeling and experimental studies of LNG heat exchanger units are discussed. The main challenges and strategies to address the volatility of LNG cold energy utilization are explored in practical application, and perspectives for future research in materials synthesis and multistage energy utilization are outlined. More insights will be found to apply CES for next-generation LNG cold energy utilization.
