You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis of coconut shell and millet residues: parameters optimization and high-quality biofuel production Waste-to-energy offers a promising solution to address energy shortages while simultaneously reducing environmental pollution. The present study aimed to enhance the biofuel production by microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis of high-lignin biomass, i.e., coconut shells (CS), and high-hemicellulose biomass, i.e., millet residues (MR). Their complementary compositions enhance synergistic effects, improving product quality and process efficiency compared to individual pyrolysis. Also, bentonite was utilized as a low-cost catalyst, and the impact of vacuum and N2 pyrolysis environments was compared. Firstly, multi-factor optimization, specifically co-feeding ratio, catalyst ratio, and pyrolysis environment, was performed to maximize bio-oil yield and its heating value using response surface methodology. Then, the intensive effect of the study variables on the quantity and quality of pyrolytic products has been investigated and assessed. The optimal pyrolysis condition was found to be a 1:3 C S:MR co-feeding ratio, 15 % catalyst ratio, and under vacuum pyrolysis environment. The results revealed that the bentonite catalyst promotes heating by increasing the heating rate and reaction temperature by 33 % and 26 % respectively, compared to the non-catalytic condition. Also, CS produces a high biochar yield, while MR results in high bio-oil and gas yields. Mixing CS/MR in a ratio of 1:3 and using bentonite enhanced the quality of the products under vacuum environment. Whereas higher hydrocarbon (27.5 %) bio-oil, low-ash (7 %) and high heating value (22.7 MJ/kg) biochar, and H2-rich gas have been achieved. This promoted the net energy recovery, reaching a maximum value of 77 %.
