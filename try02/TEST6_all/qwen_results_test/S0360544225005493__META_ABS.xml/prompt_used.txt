You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the effect of selective condensation on the distribution of co-pyrolysis products from cotton straw and polyethylene This study investigated the co-pyrolysis of CT with PE at different weight ratios (1:0, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 0:1) using thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and a vertical fixed fluidized bed. The physical intervention of different condensation temperatures on pyrolysis vapors was examined using selective condensation technology, which aimed to improve the refined condensation and enrichment of high-value-added products. The results showed that the co-pyrolysis changed the rate of weight loss of the blend. In the active pyrolysis stage, the maximum weight loss rate of 0.89 %/°C for CT2PE1 was greater than the maximum weight loss rate of 0.62 %/°C for CT. The co-pyrolysis of CT and PE led to cyclization and aromatization, allowing the hydrocarbons to undergo a series of reactions to increase the relative content of phenols. CT2PE1 had the highest relative phenolic content of 37.74 %. In addition, the high temperature of 343 K condensed the highest content of phenolic compounds in CT2PE1, which was 4.50 %.The coupling effect of co-pyrolysis technology and selective condensation technology increased the recovery rate of detectable phenolic compounds by 163.16 %. This effectively improved the enrichment of high value-added phenolic compounds in bio-oil, and provided an effective technical route for bio-oil purification and quality improvement.
