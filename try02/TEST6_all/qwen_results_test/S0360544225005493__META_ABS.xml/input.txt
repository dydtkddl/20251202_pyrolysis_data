Study on the effect of selective condensation on the distribution of co-pyrolysis products from cotton straw and polyethylene This study investigated the co-pyrolysis of CT with PE at different weight ratios (1:0, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 0:1) using thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and a vertical fixed fluidized bed. The physical intervention of different condensation temperatures on pyrolysis vapors was examined using selective condensation technology, which aimed to improve the refined condensation and enrichment of high-value-added products. The results showed that the co-pyrolysis changed the rate of weight loss of the blend. In the active pyrolysis stage, the maximum weight loss rate of 0.89 %/°C for CT2PE1 was greater than the maximum weight loss rate of 0.62 %/°C for CT. The co-pyrolysis of CT and PE led to cyclization and aromatization, allowing the hydrocarbons to undergo a series of reactions to increase the relative content of phenols. CT2PE1 had the highest relative phenolic content of 37.74 %. In addition, the high temperature of 343 K condensed the highest content of phenolic compounds in CT2PE1, which was 4.50 %.The coupling effect of co-pyrolysis technology and selective condensation technology increased the recovery rate of detectable phenolic compounds by 163.16 %. This effectively improved the enrichment of high value-added phenolic compounds in bio-oil, and provided an effective technical route for bio-oil purification and quality improvement.
