You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of waste polystyrene and palm biomass via co-pyrolysis for gasoline-range fuel production supporting low-carbon transition Palm fronds (PF), a common byproduct of the oil palm industry, and waste expanded polystyrene (EPS), a long-lasting plastic pollutant, were co-valorized through pyrolysis to generate gasoline-range hydrocarbons. This study explored various feed ratios to assess the yield and composition of pyrolysis oil produced from the co-pyrolysis of PF and EPS at 500 °C for 2 h. The resulting pyrolysis oil was primarily composed of hydrocarbons in the C6–C11 range, with boiling points reaching up to 215 °C, as determined by simulated distillation. Increasing the proportion of EPS in the feed led to a higher production of pyrolysis oil and reduced the aqueous phase. A feed ratio of PF to EPS of 1:2 yielded approximately 64.67 % pyrolysis oil. Furthermore, the addition of EPS as a co-feed enhanced the carbon content of the char to approximately 82 % while also reducing its ash content. The result offers potential for the production of liquid fuels from a mixture of agricultural byproducts and plastic waste, which contributes to the circular economy initiatives and promotes low-carbon strategies.
