Valorization of waste polystyrene and palm biomass via co-pyrolysis for gasoline-range fuel production supporting low-carbon transition Palm fronds (PF), a common byproduct of the oil palm industry, and waste expanded polystyrene (EPS), a long-lasting plastic pollutant, were co-valorized through pyrolysis to generate gasoline-range hydrocarbons. This study explored various feed ratios to assess the yield and composition of pyrolysis oil produced from the co-pyrolysis of PF and EPS at 500 °C for 2 h. The resulting pyrolysis oil was primarily composed of hydrocarbons in the C6–C11 range, with boiling points reaching up to 215 °C, as determined by simulated distillation. Increasing the proportion of EPS in the feed led to a higher production of pyrolysis oil and reduced the aqueous phase. A feed ratio of PF to EPS of 1:2 yielded approximately 64.67 % pyrolysis oil. Furthermore, the addition of EPS as a co-feed enhanced the carbon content of the char to approximately 82 % while also reducing its ash content. The result offers potential for the production of liquid fuels from a mixture of agricultural byproducts and plastic waste, which contributes to the circular economy initiatives and promotes low-carbon strategies.
