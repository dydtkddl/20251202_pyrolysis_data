You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Abrasion-wear resistance of precarbonated and water-cured concrete made using ABS plastic derived from waste electrical and electronic equipment Due to the fast proliferation of electrical and electronic equipment (PCs, TVs, and cell phones, among others), the disposal of plastic waste, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene derived from discarded electrical and electronic equipment (e-Waste), is becoming a big issue. This paper addresses this subject by utilising granulated ABS as an aggregate replacement material in concrete. The compressive strength and abrasion resistance of granulated ABS derived from electronic waste in concrete were evaluated in different replacement intervals (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %). The current investigation included microstructural and morphological characterisation utilising scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction pattern analysis. It was found that increasing the replacements of granulated ABS for the natural aggregate reduced concrete's workability, strength, and abrasion resistance. To compensate for the loss in strength and abrasion wear resistance, mixes were subjected to a precarbonation curing regime to densify the microstructure of the cementitious paste.
