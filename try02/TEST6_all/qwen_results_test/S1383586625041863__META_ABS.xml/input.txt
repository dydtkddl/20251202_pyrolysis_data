A novel nano-structured Ag2Mn8O16/Mn3O4/β-MnO2 composite catalyst for efficient HCHO degradation at near room temperature based on oxygen vacancies and Ag+/Ag0 cycle synergistic effects A nanostructured silver–manganese oxide (Ag2Mn8O16)–manganese oxide (Mn3O4)–β-MnO2 composite catalyst was synthesized via hydrothermal calcination and characterized using different methods. The precursor was initially prepared based on the reaction of a carbon dioxide (CO2)-based storage material, Mn2+, and ag+, with no external addition of morphology-controlling agents or dispersants. Redox reactions occurred during the precursor preparation. A portion of Mn2+ is oxidized to MnOx, whereas ag+ is reduced to metallic ag0. Another fraction transforms into manganese carbonate (MnCO3). In the subsequent calcination process, ag0 is reactivated to ag+ and incorporated into the oxygen vacancies of MnO2 produced from MnCO3 decomposition, forming a nonsingle-atom supported composite catalyst. At 30 °C, 0.05 g Ag2Mn8O16/Mn3O4/β-MnO2 excellently degraded 50 mg/L formaldehyde (HCHO, 10 mL) solutions after 7 h of continuous treatment, increasing the degradation efficiency to 70.79 % and the catalytic activity to 10.11 mg/(gcat·h). For highly concentrated HCHO, the degradation efficiency was >50 % after five consecutive cycles. The high positive charge of Ag+ facilitated the redox cycling of Mn ions at different oxidation states and enhanced electron transfer during the reaction. The Ag+/ag0 redox pair exhibited a synergistic catalytic effect, which activated oxygen vacancy sites and generated reactive oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic oxidation performance of Ag2Mn8O16/Mn3O4/β-MnO2. The synthesis strategy for Ag/Mn-based composite catalysts proposed herein improved their HCHO degradation performance under ambient temperature (30 °C). This study provides experimental evidence for designing and developing highly efficient HCHO degradation catalysts with practical applications in advancing the industrialization of liquid HCHO removal technologies under ambient temperature
