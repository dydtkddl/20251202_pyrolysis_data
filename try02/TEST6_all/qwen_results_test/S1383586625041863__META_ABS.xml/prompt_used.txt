You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel nano-structured Ag2Mn8O16/Mn3O4/β-MnO2 composite catalyst for efficient HCHO degradation at near room temperature based on oxygen vacancies and Ag+/Ag0 cycle synergistic effects A nanostructured silver–manganese oxide (Ag2Mn8O16)–manganese oxide (Mn3O4)–β-MnO2 composite catalyst was synthesized via hydrothermal calcination and characterized using different methods. The precursor was initially prepared based on the reaction of a carbon dioxide (CO2)-based storage material, Mn2+, and ag+, with no external addition of morphology-controlling agents or dispersants. Redox reactions occurred during the precursor preparation. A portion of Mn2+ is oxidized to MnOx, whereas ag+ is reduced to metallic ag0. Another fraction transforms into manganese carbonate (MnCO3). In the subsequent calcination process, ag0 is reactivated to ag+ and incorporated into the oxygen vacancies of MnO2 produced from MnCO3 decomposition, forming a nonsingle-atom supported composite catalyst. At 30 °C, 0.05 g Ag2Mn8O16/Mn3O4/β-MnO2 excellently degraded 50 mg/L formaldehyde (HCHO, 10 mL) solutions after 7 h of continuous treatment, increasing the degradation efficiency to 70.79 % and the catalytic activity to 10.11 mg/(gcat·h). For highly concentrated HCHO, the degradation efficiency was >50 % after five consecutive cycles. The high positive charge of Ag+ facilitated the redox cycling of Mn ions at different oxidation states and enhanced electron transfer during the reaction. The Ag+/ag0 redox pair exhibited a synergistic catalytic effect, which activated oxygen vacancy sites and generated reactive oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic oxidation performance of Ag2Mn8O16/Mn3O4/β-MnO2. The synthesis strategy for Ag/Mn-based composite catalysts proposed herein improved their HCHO degradation performance under ambient temperature (30 °C). This study provides experimental evidence for designing and developing highly efficient HCHO degradation catalysts with practical applications in advancing the industrialization of liquid HCHO removal technologies under ambient temperature
