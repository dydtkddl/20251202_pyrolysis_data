You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bringing the promises of microreactors and gold catalysis to lignocellulosic biomass valorization: A study on oxidative transformation of furfural Valorization of lignocellulosic biomass is a key to a sustainable chemical production industry. Furfural has been recognized as a major biomass-derived platform compound and a precursor of various value-added chemicals, including alkyl furoates with a wide range of applications. The conventional production of alkyl furoate utilizes concentrated acids and strong oxidants, making it an environmentally taxing process. A greener alternative is the one-pot direct conversion of furfural to alkyl furoate in an alcohol medium through oxidative esterification using molecular oxygen. However, the explosive mixtures of O2 and alcohols pose a major challenge to this process. To circumvent this issue, for the first time in the literature, we employed a catalytic microchannel reactor that enabled us to carry out the reaction over a wide range of reaction conditions, including the conventionally explosive regions. The conversion of furfural to methyl 2-furoate (MF) was carried out over a silica-supported Au catalyst coated on the inner wall of a microcapillary. A thorough experimental investigation of the reaction was conducted to obtain kinetic information while accounting for possible mass transfer effects on the process. The barely addressed mechanism of gold-assisted oxidative esterification is then investigated, taking advantage of ab initio density functional theory to examine plausible mechanisms. Experimental and computational evidence suggested that surface regeneration by O2 and decomposition of methanol to methoxy species are the crucial steps in the reaction pathway, while furfural was found to have no involvement in the rate-determining step. This work attempts to provide further insights into the reaction engineering and mechanistic aspects of furfural oxidative esterification to potentially contribute to rational catalyst design and process development.
