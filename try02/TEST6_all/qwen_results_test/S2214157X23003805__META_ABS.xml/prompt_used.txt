You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental evaluation of diesel blends mixed with municipal plastic waste pyrolysis oil on performance and emission characteristics of CI engine The growing population's amassed municipal mixed plastic waste (MMPW) and the depletion of fossil fuels are the major causes of concern. Explosive population growth has put us on the brink of an energy crisis. Therefore, an alternative energy source is required to meet the energy demand of a growing population. The chemical recycling of MMPW may be feasible to reduce plastic waste and recover energy products, especially liquid. Pyrolysis is a chemical recycling process employed in the study to produce high-grade plastic oil (PO). An investigation has been conducted on the pyrolysis of MMPW at 550 °C and has obtained 69.8 wt% PO. Moreover, different blends of PO (PO25D75, PO50D50, PO75D25 and PO100) have been used to analyse the CI engine characteristics. The engine fueled with neat plastic oil produced 6.90% less BTE than the reference diesel. However, increasing the PO proportion in diesel increased cylinder pressure and the net heat release rate (NHRR). The emissions such as CO, HC, and NOx were higher for all plastic oil blends at a 12 kg engine load, whereas CO2 and smoke opacity were reduced by 21.81% and 4.47% for PO100 at a higher engine load (12 kg) as compared to reference diesel.
