You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Radical and non-radical cooperative degradation in metal-free electro-Fenton based on nitrogen self-doped biochar To achieve sustainable metal-free electron-Fenton, N self-doped biochar air-cathode (BCAC) was prepared by pyrolyzing coffee residues. During the pyrolysis process, the endogenous N transformed from edge-doping to graphite-doping. Particularly, N vacancies started to evolve when the peak temperature exceeded 700 °C. A high Tetracycline removal rate of 70.42% was obtained on the BCAC at the current density of 4 mA cm−2. Quenching tests incorporated with ESR spectroscopy were adopted to identify the specific oxidants produced on the cathode. The results showed that •OH (37.36%), •O2 - (29.67%) and 1O2 (24.17%) played comparable role in the tetracycline removal, suggesting the coexist of radical and non-radical oxidants in our electro-Fenton system. According to the structure characterization and the DFT calculation, graphitic N was suggested as the critical site for H2O2 generation, and both graphitic N and pyridinic N were electroactive sites for H2O2 activation to •OH. Graphitic N and N vacancies with stronger capabilities in O2 adsorption and electron-trapping were proposed as the electroactive sites for 1O2 and •O2 - formation. This work predicts a novel electro-Fenton process with cooperative radical and non-radical degradation on N self-doped carbonaceous catalysts at a mild condition, which is extremely meaningful for boosting sustainable electro-Fenton technology.
