A comparative study on co-combustion performance of municipal solid waste and Indonesian coal with high ash Indian coal: A thermogravimetric analysis In recent years there has been an increasing utilization of coal blends in the Indian power industry, with Indonesian coal, due to high ash content and shortages in domestic coal production. On the other hand, rapid economic growth is aggravating the municipal solid waste (MSW) related environmental problems. In this study, an attempt has been made to compare the co-combustion characteristics of hydrothermally treated MSW and Indonesian coal with high ash Indian coal, so as to replace the Indonesian coal with MSW. The effect of blending Indonesian coal and hydrothermally treated MSW with Indian coal on ignition behavior was studied. MSW blends of 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% (in wt.%), and an Indonesian blend of 10% with Indian coal were tested in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the temperature from ambient to 700°C with a temperature increase of 10°C/min. From the results, at 10% of blend, ignition and carbon burnout were similar for Indonesian and MSW blend, analogous to coal combustion and even better than the Indonesian coal blend, which indicated the feasibility for replacing Indonesian coal with hydrothermally treated MSW. Further, the results show a scope to increase the MSW blend in Indian coal up to 20%, as the constituents behave as a single fuel.
