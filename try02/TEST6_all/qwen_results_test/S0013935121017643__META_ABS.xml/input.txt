Recent progress on ultrasound-assisted electrochemical processes: A review on mechanism, reactor strategies, and applications for wastewater treatment The electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have received significant attention among the many other water and wastewater treatment technologies. However, achieving a desirable removal effect with a single technique is frequently difficult. Therefore, the integration of ultrasound technique with other processes such as electrocoagulation, electro-Fenton, and electrooxidation is a critical way to achieve effective organic pollutants decomposition from wastewater. This review paper is focused on ultrasound-assisted electrochemical (US/electrochemical) processes, so-called sonoelectrochemical processes of various organic pollutants. Emphasis was given to recently published articles for discussing the results and trends in this research area. The use of ultrasound and integration with electrochemical processes has a synergistic impact owing to the physical and chemical consequences of cavitation, resulting in enhancing the mineralization of organic pollutants. Various types of sonoelectrochemical reactors (batch and continuous) employed in the US/electrochemical processes were reviewed. In addition, the strategies to avoid passivation, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, and mixing effect are reviewed. Finally, concluding remarks and future perspectives on this research topic are also explored and recommended.
