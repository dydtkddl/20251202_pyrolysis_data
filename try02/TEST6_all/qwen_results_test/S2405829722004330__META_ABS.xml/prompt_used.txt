You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-functional yolk-shell structured materials and their applications for high-performance lithium ion battery and lithium sulfur battery Lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells have aroused widespread concern regarding as prospective compositions for most commonly energy storage devices because of high specific capacity and excellent energy density. But some weaknesses still exist such as high cost and low theoretical specific capacity of Li-ion cell, which is difficult to meet people's increasing demand for high energy density. And unsatisfactory conductivity and notorious “shuttle effect” of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) for Li-S cell, which will affect the commercialization. In various structures of battery materials, yolk-shell structured materials, possessing hollow shell and interior core, show outstanding applied potential for the cells because of having appropriate pore sizes, abundant active sites, prevented aggregation of active materials, accommodated volume expansions and more facilitated channels for electrons and Li+ transportation and functional groups to effectively adsorb LiPSs. Thus many novel yolk-shell structured materials are applied to cell materials to resolve the problems mentioned above. In this review, recent progresses on yolk-shell structured materials used in the cells including their preparation methods, geometric morphology design, action mechanisms in enhancing electrochemical performances and safety are generalized. Then we have a sufficient discussion for yolk-shell structured materials in the cells and build structure-function relationships between structured materials and cell performances. At last, some challenges and suggestions about their preparations, functional modifications and actual applications of yolk-shell structured materials in the cells are summarized. We hope the review can attract more people's attention and conduct more researches on yolk-shell structured materials for various secondary batteries.
