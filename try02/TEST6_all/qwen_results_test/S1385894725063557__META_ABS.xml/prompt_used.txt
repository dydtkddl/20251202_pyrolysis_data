You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metabolic engineering of Yarrowia lipolytica for efficient conversion of valorised food waste into D-lactic acid Lactic acid (LA) is a widely used platform chemical that can be transformed into a multitude of products. The microbial production of LA is been dominated by Lactic acid bacteria (LAB). However, due to its strict and costly media requirements, the economy of the LA production process is still challenging. In the present study, a codon-optimized ldhA gene encoding D-lactic acid (D-LA) from K. pneumoniae was expressed in the Yarrowia lipolytica PO1d strain. After initial optimisation studies, the YDldh strain reached 0.37 (g/g) of D-LA yield and also showed significant acetic acid accumulation. Further, the ACS2 (Acetyl CoA synthase) gene from S. cerevisiae (S288C) encoding acetyl CoA synthase was expressed in the YDldh strain, which increased acetic acid assimilation up to 10 (g/L) and enhanced LA production. Food waste hydrolysate (FWH) was produced by valorising mixed food waste with crude fungal enzymes produced using Aspergillus terreus BPD01. A scale-up study in a 3.3 L bioreactor of YDldh and YDl-Acs strains using two different carbon sources, FWH and glucose, was carried out. The YDl-Acs strain exhibited 0.70 (g/g) of D-LA with 5% glucose in a complex medium. Comparatively, the YDldh strain showed reduced D-LA production in both types of carbon sources. The YDl-Acs strain with FWH showed 0.53 (g/g) of D-lactic acid and supported the idea of utilizing food waste in lactic acid production. FWH can be a promising economic carbon source, and further optimisation could produce the D-LA at a competitive yield.
