A review on waste derived carbon nanozyme: An emerging catalytic material for monitoring and degrading environmental pollutants The rapid increase in population and urbanization leads to a significant release of various contaminants into the environment, and thereby poses substantial risks to human health and the ecological system. While natural enzymes have been traditionally used for efficient monitoring and removal of environmental contaminants, their high production costs and limited stability under different operating conditions are major drawbacks. Recently, nanozymes, which are nanomaterials that mimic enzymes, have garnered significant attention as an alternative to natural enzymes. Carbon-based nanozymes, in particular, have exhibited their enormous potential for environmental applications due to their eco-friendly nature, high structural stability, and abundance of active sites. This review article primarily focuses on the development of carbon-based nanozymes from various organic waste resources and their application for the detection of pollutants such as pesticides, toxic ions, and other organic pollutants. Additionally, the potential of these nanozymes for organic contaminants degradation and pathogen decontamination is also discussed. Accordingly, a comprehensive overview has been presented for the utility of waste materials as precursors for the development of carbon-based nanozymes, contributing to sustainable synthesis in future nanozyme research.
