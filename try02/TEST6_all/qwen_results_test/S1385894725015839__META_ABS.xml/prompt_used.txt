You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on waste derived carbon nanozyme: An emerging catalytic material for monitoring and degrading environmental pollutants The rapid increase in population and urbanization leads to a significant release of various contaminants into the environment, and thereby poses substantial risks to human health and the ecological system. While natural enzymes have been traditionally used for efficient monitoring and removal of environmental contaminants, their high production costs and limited stability under different operating conditions are major drawbacks. Recently, nanozymes, which are nanomaterials that mimic enzymes, have garnered significant attention as an alternative to natural enzymes. Carbon-based nanozymes, in particular, have exhibited their enormous potential for environmental applications due to their eco-friendly nature, high structural stability, and abundance of active sites. This review article primarily focuses on the development of carbon-based nanozymes from various organic waste resources and their application for the detection of pollutants such as pesticides, toxic ions, and other organic pollutants. Additionally, the potential of these nanozymes for organic contaminants degradation and pathogen decontamination is also discussed. Accordingly, a comprehensive overview has been presented for the utility of waste materials as precursors for the development of carbon-based nanozymes, contributing to sustainable synthesis in future nanozyme research.
