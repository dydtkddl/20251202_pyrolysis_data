Emerging 2D materials for hydrogen detection: mechanism, challenges, & opportunities Hydrogen is gaining popularity in the global energy industry as a potential replacement for fossil fuels and a means to reduce harmful emissions. Due to its explosive and combustible nature, extreme caution is mandatory in all handling processes, especially when its concentration is above ∼4%. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently shown exceptional capacity to detect hydrogen through a variety of mechanism, making them suitable for developing hydrogen gas sensors that can function even at ambient temperature. This is the recent challenge posed by a group of nanomaterials to the conventional noble metal nanoparticle based receptors. This review focuses on 2D materials (including Van der Waal and non Van der Waal nanomaterials) showing how their unique interfaces, atomic thickness, and programmable surface terminations reinvent the principles of hydrogen sensing. In addition to providing an overview of recent advancements, it methodically addresses how these advanced nanomaterials might be incorporated into two- and three-terminal device designs, and the obstacles still standing in the way of developing workable, scalable sensor technologies. The perspective of the article suggests future opportunities and challenges for hydrogen sensing in practical applications.
