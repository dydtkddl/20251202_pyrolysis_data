You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Controlling liquid hydrocarbon composition in valorization of plastic waste via tuning zeolite framework and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio Abundance of plastic waste has become threat to the mankind and aquatic life and thus needs to be recycled or converted into value added products. Liquefaction of waste plastics via catalytic cracking is one the efficient routes towards plastic waste management. Concerning this, in present study, conversion of polymer mixture containing polypropylene, low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene (PP, LDPE and HDPE) was done for the production of gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons using two-step cracking approach. MWW and MFI (12 and 10 member ring structures respectively) type zeolites having different pore structure and acidity were used for catalytic cracking of polymer feed at 350 °C. Investigations revealed that MWW type zeolite having two independent pore channels selectively provides gasoline range of hydrocarbons (C7–C12, 99.12%) in polymer cracking reaction as compared to MFI type which results in C13–C20 range of hydrocarbons (73.19%). Hydrocarbon compositions were confirmed from GC-MS, 1H, 13C NMR and FT-IR techniques. In activity results it was observed that acidity of zeolites affects the liquid yield and hydrocarbon distribution as analysed by using zeolites of two different SiO2/Al2O3 (SAR) ratio (30 and 55) which directs that zeolite (MFI/MWW) with lower SAR (30) having higher acidity results in higher yield of fuel range liquid hydrocarbons as compared to higher SAR (55) zeolite. Characterization studies such as XRD, N2-physisorption, NH3-TPD, FE-SEM and EDX were performed to check the physiochemical properties of zeolite and correlated with the activity. Overall, the present investigation provides detailed comparative study on plastic degradation using MFI and MWW type zeolites resulting into different range of liquid hydrocarbons.
