You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Screening of common synthetic polymers for depolymerization by subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction Hydrothermal liquefaction could potentially utilize mixed plastic wastes for sustainable biocrude production, however the fate of plastics under HTL is largely unexplored for the same reaction conditions. In this study, we evaluate how synthetic waste polymers can be depolymerized to bio-crude or platform chemicals using HTL at typical conditions expected in future commercial applications with and without alkali catalyst (potassium hydroxide). We evaluate different characteristics for HTL processing of poly-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), Bisphenol-A Epoxy-resin, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low density PE (LDPE), polyamide 6 (PA6), polyamide 66 (PA66), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyurethane (PUR) at 350 °C and 20 min residence time. Polyolefins and PS showed little depolymerization due to lack of reactive sites for hydrolysis. HTL of PC and Epoxy yielded predominantly bisphenol-A in oil fraction and phenols in aqueous phase. PA6 and PA66 yielded one of its monomers caprolactam and a range of platform chemicals in the aqueous phase. PET produces both original monomers. PUR yields a complex oil containing similar molecules to its monomers and longer hydrocarbons. Our results show how HTL can depolymerize several different synthetic polymers and highlights which of those are the most attractive or are unsuitable for subcritical processing.
