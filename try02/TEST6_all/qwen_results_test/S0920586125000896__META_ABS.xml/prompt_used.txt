You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Iron-doped carbon nanotubes via microwave shock: Recyclability in polypropylene pyrolysis for ORR catalyst manufacturing The recycling and upcycling of waste plastics into high-value products by pyrolysis is a critical challenge caused by its time/energy-consuming problems, which can be overcome by employing microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis due to its rapid pyrolysis rates and high product yields. This study presents a facile method for the synthesis of catalysts for microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics, utilizing the pyrolytic products as raw materials. In this case, a microwave thermal shock strategy is developed to efficiently anchor iron nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This method recycles a portion of pyrolysis products back into the catalyst pool for plastic transformation into new CNTs, reducing the consumption for preparing additional catalysts. The precursors exposed to 50 W microwave irradiation reaches above 2000 °C within seconds, allowing Fe nanoparticles to be uniformly impregnated within the carbon nanotube matrix. The formed iron-doped CNTs shows high activity for microwave-assisted pyrolysis, generating CNTs with D/G ratios at 0.31. The recycling and reconstruction of CNTs after multiple pyrolysis form a cross-lined network structure, which facilitates electron transition and can be utilized for fabricating electrocatalysts. Nitrogen doping further improves the onset potential to 0.923 V vs. RHE, making them viable candidates for electrocatalytic applications in oxygen reduction reactions. In summary, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to reactive pyrolysis products that serve as catalysis for microwave-assisted pyrolysis, with the potential to reduce volatile organic compound emissions and capital expenditure in catalyst preparation, offering a greener and more efficient pathway for plastic waste management and catalyst production.
