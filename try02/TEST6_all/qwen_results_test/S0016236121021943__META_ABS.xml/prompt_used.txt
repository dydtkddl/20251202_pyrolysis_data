You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive insight from microalgae production process to characterization of biofuel for the sustainable energy The present article reviews about the algae isolation, microalgae growth, types of cultivation, oil extraction, biodiesel characterization and the advantage of microalgae biomass and its other applications. A detailed review was undertaken on various microalgae harvesting methods, types of oil extraction and biodiesel production. The merits and demerits of open pond systems and photo-bioreactors cultivation are discussed briefly. The various microalgae species and its lipids used for biodiesel production were presented and compared with conventional feedstocks. This article also discusses the key process parameter for in-situ transesterification for biodiesel production such as molar ratio, stirring rate, moisture, reaction time, catalyst type and temperature. The fundamental characterization of the biodiesel and physiochemical properties such as flash point, cetane number, density, kinematic viscosity, pour and cloud point and calorific value were studied and compared with the results of conventional diesel. This study reports that oil from microalgae can be a suitable alternative than edible oils due to ease of growth, separation, and high lipid content. The properties of microalgae biodiesel meet ASTM standards. Overall, algae are not only a potential source for biofuel but can also be used in wastewater treatment, food additives, carbon sequestration, heath care, cancer treatment and aquaculture all of which are discussed in this review.
