You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flame-retardation of thermoplastic polyesters via cyclotetramerization from phthalonitrile to phthalocyanine: Pyrolysis processes and fire behaviour Flame retardancy is a way to enhance the fire safety performance of polymers, which can slow down the flame spread and reduce the severity of fire events. Phthalocyanines (Pcs) skeletons have unleashed high flame-retardant efficiency in thermosetting resins. However, limited by the high stability and bulky structure of Pcs, how to make this classic macrocyclic structure play its flame retardant advantages in thermoplastic polymers is still a significant challenge. We synthesized flame-retardant copolyesters (CxPET) via chemically incorporating the phenoxyphthalonitrile structures into the polymer chains of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by melt polymerization. PY-GC–MS tests at 400, 500, and 700 °C are performed to detailedly investigate the pyrolysis processes. The TGA, LOI, and UL-94 tests are carried out to reveal the burning behavior. The LOI, vertical UL-94, and cone calorimeter tests, are used to characterize the flame-retardant properties and the fire behavior. The copolyesters, containing phenoxyphthalonitrile structures, exhibit good flame retardance (LOI 30.0, UL-94V-0 level with no dripping producing). The peak heat release rate (337 ± 32 kW m−2) and TSR (1377 ± 74 m2 m−2) are also reduced by 55.4% and 20.2%, compared with PET. Combining the pyrolysis processes and fire behavior results, the phthalonitrile structures can be quickly transformed into phthalocyanine structures at high temperatures. Further, the formed phthalocyanines play a flame-retardant role via promoting the charring of copolyesters. Therefore, this work supplies an available way to play the flame retardant advantages of phthalocyanine macrocyclic in thermoplastic polymers, and provides key guidance for the design of safer polymers.
