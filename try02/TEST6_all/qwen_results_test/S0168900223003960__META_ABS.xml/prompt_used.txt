You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Boron-containing plastic composites as neutron shielding material for additive manufacturing processes A study of samples of shielding materials which exploit plastic as the basis of neutron absorbing composite with 25%–37% weight boron-containing powder has been provided. Composite samples were prepared by fused filament fabrication (FFF). Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) plastics were used as the polymer matrix material, while boron nitride powder and amorphous boron powder were used as boron-containing fillers. According to measurements of the neutron transmission on the monochromatic beam of the IR-8 reactor (main monochromatic neutron beam line - 2.4 Å), the use of boron as a filler in the plastic provides a decrease in the penetration depth of neutrons by 56%–78%: from 3.0 mm for a sample of plastic without filler to 0.65 mm for a sample with amorphous boron powder. Tensile and bending mechanical tests showed that the addition of boron-containing powder leads to development of brittleness of composite materials. The boron-containing samples experienced a 40%–55% of strength decrease and the failure of samples occurred without plastic deformation, while in ABS and PETG samples the plastic deformation takes up a significant portion of the test diagram.
