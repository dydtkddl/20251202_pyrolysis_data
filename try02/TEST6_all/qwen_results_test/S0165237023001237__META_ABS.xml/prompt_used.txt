You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2-H2O assisted co-pyrolysis of petroleum vacuum residue and polypropylene to improve asphaltene reduction and coke suppression: A statistical approach Non-catalytic co-pyrolysis of petroleum vacuum residue (VR) and polypropylene (PP) was studied under CO2 and/or steam atmospheres in a batch condition. A statistical approach was performed to analyze the effect of temperature, CO2 initial pressure, reaction time, PP and water contents using fractional factorial design methodology. A comparison of co-pyrolysis in steam, CO2, and steam + CO2 atmospheres showed that CO2 + steam is a more effective environment for reduction of asphaltene and suppressing coke formation. In detail, steam dominated the pyrolysis process, whereas CO2 enhanced the thermal cracking reactions, thereby increasing the asphaltene conversion to maltene and decreasing coke formation. Moreover, the results indicated that the addition of PP to VR improved the yield and quality of the liquid product and diminished the coke content. The optimum conditions were the temperature of 380 °C, CO2 initial pressure of 0.6 MPa, reaction time of 90 min with PP/ VR and water/ VR ratios of 0.23, and 0.25 (g/g), respectively. Pyrolysis of VR under such conditions resulted in the 86% maltene yield, 89.7% asphaltene reduction and 6.3% coke reduction. 1H NMR analysis showed that paraffins occupy the major content of the liquid (81.07 vol%), followed by aromatics (12.28 vol%) and olefinic compounds (6.65 vol%). In addition, the upgraded oil had a remarkable °API gravity of 35.9 and a low viscosity of 5.27 ± 0.02 cP. Furthermore, heavy metals of Ni and V were removed from the liquid product by 56.1% and 65.6%, respectively. Pyrolysis of VR with PP in the CO2 + steam environment would be deemed an economically viable and environmentally friendly technique of transforming the abundant low-grade VR feedstocks to valuable liquid fuels at a milder processing condition without using any catalysts.
