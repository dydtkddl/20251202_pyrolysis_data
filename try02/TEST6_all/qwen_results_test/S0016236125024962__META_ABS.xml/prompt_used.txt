You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analytical and experimental study of switchgrass and agricultural plastic co-pyrolysis in a microwave reactor This work describes initial results from microwave co-pyrolysis of switchgrass and agricultural plastic waste in the form of polyethylene (PE) hay bale covers. Analytical pyrolysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to better understand the volatile composition and thermal decomposition behavior during co-pyrolysis. Experimental microwave pyrolysis was carried out in a 1.2 kW multimode microwave cavity to pyrolyze 100 g of feedstock mixed with activated carbon absorber at different temperatures (350, 400, 500, 550, and 600 °C) and the product compositions were analyzed. The liquid and wax product compositions were found to have an additive effect, where switchgrass mainly contributed to the liquid fraction and PE mainly contributed to the hydrocarbon fraction. The greatest recovery of condensable organics was obtained at 400 °C with a greater proportion of organic liquids and 600 °C with a greater proportion of waxes. Further, the waxy fraction was converted into pitch to investigate a potential high value application for this fraction that is difficult to thermally decompose.
