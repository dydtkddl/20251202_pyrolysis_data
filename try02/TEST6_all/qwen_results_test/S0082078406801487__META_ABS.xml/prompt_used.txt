You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Functional forms of nitrogen in coals and the release of coal nitrogen as NO x precursors (HCN and NH3) The influence of coal nitrogen on the pyrolytic release of NO x precursors, (HCN and NH3), has been investigated for a range of Australian coals. Functional forms of nitrogen in the coals were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Pyrrolic-type nitrogen predominated (50–60% coal nitrogen), but pyridinic and quaternary forms were also detected. The proportion of pyridinic increased and that of quaternary decreased with increasing carbon contents of the coals. Four coals, ranging in rank from brown to bituminous and in nitrogen content from 0.6–2.0%, dry ash free basis, were pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1100°C, gas residence times of 0.3–0.5 s and particle heating rates of 104 K s−1. Formation of HCN and NH3 occurred at higher temperatures than that required for maximum tar yields; cracking reactions of the tars are a probable source of HCN and NH3. However, the results show that release of nitrogen from structures which are not volatilised as tar also occurs. The major nitrogen-containing components of the tars were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Nitrogen contained in pyridinic groups was more stable than that in pyrrolic groups; thus, a higher pyrolysis temperature was necessary to release nitrogen as HCN and NH3 from the pyridinic groups. For the range of coals and pyrolysis conditions studied here, however, nitrogen release (as a proportion of total coal nitrogen), in the form of NO x precursors, did not depend on coal type or coal nitrogen content.
