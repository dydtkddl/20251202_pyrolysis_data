You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanostructured KxNa1-xNbO3 hollow spheres as potential materials for the photocatalytic treatment of polluted water Potassium-sodium niobate-based hollows spheres were studied in the photocatalytic degradation of Basic Blue 41 dye in aqueous phase under UV irradiation. KxNa1-xNbO3 materials were prepared at 700 °C by the spray pyrolysis method. Photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and FTIR. Different kinetic models of adsorption, direct photolysis, and photocatalytic degradation of the azo-dye were performed as a function of the pH of solution. The increase in potassium content is responsible of the distortion and polarization of the niobate structure promoting a decrease in the energy band-gap down to 3.01 eV for K0.5Na0.5NbO3. The photocatalytic activity observed on K0.5Na0.5NbO3 was up to 23 times higher than that on TiO2 in terms of the surface concentration of the azo-dye molecules adsorbed. A mechanism for the degradation of Basic Blue 41 azo-dye based on the reactive oxygen species detected by scavenger’s tests and mass-spectroscopy analysis was proposed.
