Biochar: An environmentally friendly platform for construction of a SARS-CoV-2 electrochemical immunosensor Waste management is a key feature to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, and to combat the impacts of climate change. In this scenario, the production of biochar from different biomasses results in environmental and economic advantages. In this study, biochar was produced from sugarcane bagasse pyrolysis, to immobilize biomolecules, in order to assemble an electrochemical immunosensor to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. For this, screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) were modified with a dispersion of biochar and used to immobilize the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) against virus S-protein, through EDC/NHS crosslinking reaction. Under the best set of experimental conditions, negative and positive serum samples responses distinguished based on a cutoff value of 82.3 %, at a 95 % confidence level. The immunosensor showed selective behavior to antibodies against yellow fever and its performance was stable up to 7 days of storage. Therefore, biochar yielded from sugarcane bagasse is an ecofriendly material that can be used as a platform to immobilize biomolecules for construction of electrochemical biosensors.
