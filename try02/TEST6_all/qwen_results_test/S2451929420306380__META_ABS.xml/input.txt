Catalytic processing of plastic waste on the rise Approximately 80% of the >350 Mt of plastics produced annually is turned into waste, which equals 30% of the European electricity consumption. Chemocatalytic strategies giving life to fuels, chemicals, and monomers promise to transform plastic pollution, barely addressed by incineration and mechanical recycling, into an opportunity. Under the motto “catalysis generates plastics and should handle their fate,” this review integrates fundamentals and applications of catalytic transformations of seven major plastics. Following algorithmic analysis of >400 articles and patents, it outlines relevant systems for 13 frontrunner routes based on heterogeneous, homogeneous, and biocatalysis. Given the predominance of off-the-shelf catalysts, it stresses transposable state-of-the-art systems of developed fields to foster design of materials. Based on recent system engineering analyses, it highlights more sustainable paths for implementation, unattended by current trends in industry and academia. It closes with a unified view and critical thoughts on research priorities to accelerate progress toward a sustainable plastic economy.
