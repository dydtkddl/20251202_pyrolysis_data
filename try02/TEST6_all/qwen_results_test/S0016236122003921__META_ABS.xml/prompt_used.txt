You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gasification characteristics of a simulated waste under separate and mixed atmospheres of steam and CO2 Downdraft gasifier is attractive for small-scale solid waste treatment, but the gasification characteristics are worthy of deep research. In this study, a two-stage continuous feeding apparatus was developed to examine the effect of moisture content of the mixed feedstock on co-gasification. Furthermore, considering the effect of CO2 from flue gas, the gasification experiments were carried out when CO2 participated in the gasification alone or in a mixed atmosphere of CO2 and steam. The pyrolysis residue plays an essential role in the gasification with steam, which can improve the syngas yield, especially the H2 yield reaches 0.345 m3/kg when steam and feedstock mass ratio (S/F) is 0.8. CO2 is inferior to steam in promoting H2 formation. But when CO2 and feedstock mass ratio (C/F) rises from 0.74 to 1.48, the gas yield increases from 60.52% to 77.15%, and the yields of tar and residue cut down correspondingly. CO2 is still an alternative gasifying agent, which can partially substitute steam in the gasification process. However, when CO2 coexists with a small amount of steam (S/F = 0.4), introducing excessive CO2 (C/F = 1.48) will intensify the competition between steam and CO2.
