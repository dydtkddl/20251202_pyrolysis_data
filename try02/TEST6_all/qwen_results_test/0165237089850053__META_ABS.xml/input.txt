Production of olefins from flash pyrolysis of cellulose-containing material Total olefin, butadiene and acetylene yields from the flash pyrolysis of cellulose have been found to reach up to 9% of the sample weight. This observation is based on the measurement of the individual C2 to C5 olefin, butadiene and acetylene yields from microcrystalline cellulose powder (MCP), cellulose particles, ash- and lignin-free filter paper, chemically purified lignin and a groundwood newsprint. The ethene: ethane ratio ranged from about 2 to 6 for MCP and was independent of cellulose conversion and pyrolysis temperature, whereas the propene:propane ratio changed from 0.1 to 10 as the conversion and temperature increased. The C4 and C5 olefin: paraffin ratios showed an intermediate behavior. Acetylene yields were about one-tenth those of ethene, but otherwise behaved as the C2 olefin. Pyrolysis device, heating rate, particle size and cellulose source appear to have no influence on the olefin: paraffin ratio.
