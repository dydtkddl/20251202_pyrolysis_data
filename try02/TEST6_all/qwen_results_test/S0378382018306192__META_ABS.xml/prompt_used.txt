You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and gasification studies of model refuse derived fuel (RDF) using thermogravimetric analysis Processing Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) into a Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) reduces experimental variability and improves handling. This study analyzes the pyrolysis of individual components to define the model components that mimic real RDF. Size reduction and effective mixing of nine components of model RDF composition allow for reproducible results in lab scale experiments. Selected individual components as well as the model RDF composite are converted by pyrolysis and gasification at 800 °C with a 20 K/min heating rate. The pyrolysis results show that the decomposition profile, product yields, heat of decomposition, and gas composition of the model RDF can be predicted by adding the corresponding values of the individual components in the required proportions. The inorganic content of the individual component chars is found to have a profound effect on the gasification reactivities. Potassium and calcium have the largest catalytic effect during gasification, while silicon and phosphorous inhibit gasification. Potassium mobility and redistribution from orange peels in the model RDF to the other components is determined to be chiefly responsible for the synergistic gasification profile of the char. Furthermore, synergy is observed at different particle size ranges (<106 μm and 0.6–0.8 mm) tested. However, the extent of synergy varies in the two cases leading to different reaction times for complete conversion.
