You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interaction between thermal cracking and steam reforming reactions of aviation kerosene Heat transfer and reaction behavior of aviation kerosene were investigated numerically and experimentally at a supercritical pressure. A global thermal cracking and catalytic reforming reaction model were modified and developed based on the experimental data. A set of surrogate components for aviation kerosene was built and its thermodynamic properties were predicted. Interactions among heat transfer, cracking and catalytic steam reforming reactions were simulated in a micro-channel reactor. Comparison between calculation and experiment showed that the numerical model can predict the wall and outlet fuel temperatures with an error not exceeding 5%. The conversion rate of kerosene and water were also in good agreement with experimental data. Heat transfer deterioration phenomenon can be observed when fuel contains water. Fuel with catalytic steam reforming reactions had the advantage of weakening the heat transfer deterioration and obvious promotion in heat sink. Heat transfer process can be divided into four sub-regions: entrance, gasification, transition and interactive reaction regions. The two kinds of reactions occurring in the reaction region significantly improve the heat sink of hydrocarbon fuel. Interactions between cracking and reforming reactions illustrated that the reaction region were considerably moved ahead due to the existing of steam reforming reactions, resulting in lower fuel temperature which led to a lower rate of thermal cracking and conversion. Thermal cracking reaction was inhibited by catalytic steam reforming reactions.
