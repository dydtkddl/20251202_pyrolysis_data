You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zirconia encrusted ceramic composite membrane for uremic toxins removal: Fabrication and assessment of biocompatibility In this study, tubular zirconia composite membranes (ZM1-ZM3) were developed using low-cost tubular substrate which was prepared utilizing naturally available clay materials by an extrusion approach. The zirconia nanoparticles were encrusted on a low-cost tubular substrate using spray pyrolysis technique. The membranes were investigated for their biocompatibility in addition to pore size, chemical stability, water permeability, porosity, contact angle, thermogravimetric (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Water permeability, pore size and porosity of optimized membrane (ZM3) were 3.05 × 10–4 ± 0.03 L.m-2.h-1.Pa-1, 119 ± 0.57 nm and 36 ± 0.12 %, respectively. Platelets adhesion and protein adsorption were measured to be 4630 ± 46 platelets.mm-2, and 1.05 ± 0.02 μg.cm-2 respectively, while the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were 80 ± 0.51 s and 27 ± 0.26 s, respectively. Complement activation C3 and C4 concentrations were assessed to be 76.2 ± 0.88 mg.dL-1 and 21.57 ± 0.80 mg.dL-1, respectively and hemolysis ratio was 0.31 ± 0.01 %. Moreover, the membrane had a considerable antifouling nature with a flux recovery ratio of 89.22 ± 0.58 %. Protein retention was found to be 81.14 ± 0.58 %, in addition to outstanding sieving coefficients of uremic toxins like urea (0.95 ± 0.005), creatinine (0.93 ± 0.004), and phosphate (0.90 ± 0.004). These findings suggest that the produced tubular zirconia composite membrane has the potency for hemofiltration.
