You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive overview of the continuous torrefaction method: Operational characteristics, applications, and challenges Throughout the history, the whole world have been concerned with the supply of energy and fuel. Today, technological advancements and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves have made countries to think about energy and alternative fuels that can be tapped in a more effective and sustainable manners. Several methods are available to address the imminent energy shortage, including diversification of the available energy resources. With the advent of biomass in large quantities at low costs, sustainable energy sources have opened up new possibilities. However, raw biomass is less suitable to use because of certain characteristics, such as low energy yield, high moisture content, and inadequate storage and processing. Due to these issues, pre-treatment has gained a lot of attention to convert these materials into fuels of value. Continuous Torrefaction is one of the most promising candidates for the pretreatment method of these materials that has sparked interests for researchers. During this treatment, the raw biomasses are exposed to a temperature between 200 and 300 °C under a controlled atmosphere that produces solid biofuels with elevated thermochemical features. An in-depth examination of continuous torrefaction, including its operational characteristics, applications, and challenges, is provided in this study. This research examines continuous torrefaction from the perspective of operational characteristics, applications, and challenges. In addition to the temperature, residence time, and feeding rate, several operating parameters will be evaluated in relation to continuous torrefaction, including how they affect the torrefied biomass's properties.
