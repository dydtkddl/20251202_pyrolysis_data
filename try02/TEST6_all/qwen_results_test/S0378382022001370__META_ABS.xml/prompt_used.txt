You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electromagnetic induction-assisted pyrolysis of pre-treated MSW: Modelling and experimental analysis The paper presents an innovative method for the energetic valorisation of municipal solid waste (MSW) through pyrolysis with electromagnetic induction technology. The MSW fraction treated is retained during the sieving pretreatment operation to separate the organic fraction intended for the anaerobic digestion producing advanced biofuel. Pyrolysis is a technology that could be a valuable option for the treatment of municipal solid waste. It is considered a valid alternative to waste incineration since it allows the production of chemicals and biofuels with low SOx and NOx emissions and, therefore, a low environmental impact. The heating system based on induction technology avoids traditional burners, improving the process energy efficiency and optimising the thermal distribution inside the reactor. The study is conducted by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, which allowed to optimise the geometry, to analyse the heat distribution within the reactor, guaranteeing more flexibility in the high variability of input material to be treated. Experiments on a laboratory scale reactor were carried out to validate the CFD model results. The proposed model correctly predicts the experimental outputs at the operative conditions tested.
