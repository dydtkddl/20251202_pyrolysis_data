Electromagnetic induction-assisted pyrolysis of pre-treated MSW: Modelling and experimental analysis The paper presents an innovative method for the energetic valorisation of municipal solid waste (MSW) through pyrolysis with electromagnetic induction technology. The MSW fraction treated is retained during the sieving pretreatment operation to separate the organic fraction intended for the anaerobic digestion producing advanced biofuel. Pyrolysis is a technology that could be a valuable option for the treatment of municipal solid waste. It is considered a valid alternative to waste incineration since it allows the production of chemicals and biofuels with low SOx and NOx emissions and, therefore, a low environmental impact. The heating system based on induction technology avoids traditional burners, improving the process energy efficiency and optimising the thermal distribution inside the reactor. The study is conducted by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, which allowed to optimise the geometry, to analyse the heat distribution within the reactor, guaranteeing more flexibility in the high variability of input material to be treated. Experiments on a laboratory scale reactor were carried out to validate the CFD model results. The proposed model correctly predicts the experimental outputs at the operative conditions tested.
