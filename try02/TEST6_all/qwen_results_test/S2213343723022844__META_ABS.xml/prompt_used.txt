You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Clean solid fuel production through co-hydrothermal carbonization of polyvinyl chloride mat and wheat straw with acid assistance: Conversion mechanism and combustion performance Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to produce high-value-added hydrochars as a solid fuel alternative can play a pivotal role in carbon sequestration and energy supply. However, there is unclear for the interaction mechanism and combustion performance of co-hydrochars derived from PVC waste and biomass. In this study, waste PVC mats (PVCM) mixed with wheat straw (WS) were as feedstocks to prepare the co-hydrochars by the acid-catalyzed co-HTC at different hydrothermal temperatures and mass ratios. The presence of WS enhanced the PVCM substitution and prevented the condensation of the PVCM-derived hydrochar aggregation. In turn, PVCM played a stimulative role in the WS decomposition. Meanwhile, the interactions were improved sufficiently in the acidic mediums. The fuel properties and combustion behavior of co-hydrochars were elevated by valid interactions between PVCM and WS. The co-hydrochar obtained using co-HTC at a mass ratio of 1:1 under 240 °C (HC-240–1:1) exhibited the optimal higher heating value (32.72 MJ/kg), splendid dechlorination efficiency (97.41%) as well as worthy fuel ratio (0.89). The combustion process of HC-240–1:1 was more facile and consistent as a result of the elevated ignition and burnout temperatures along with reduced activation energies. Furthermore, the liquid phase products were recycled to assess the reusability. The process water expedited the process of co-HTC, which was confirmed by the improved HHV (32.72 MJ/kg to 39.71 MJ/kg) and mass yield (30.73% to 32.44%). The strategy of PVC waste mixed with biomass through the acid-catalyzed co-HTC was considered a promising way to produce environmentally friendly solid fuels, providing some theoretical basis for the commercialization of co-HTC.
