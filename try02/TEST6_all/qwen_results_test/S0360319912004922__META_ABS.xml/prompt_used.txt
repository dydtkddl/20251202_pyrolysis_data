You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Palladium nanoparticles supported on chemically derived graphene: An efficient and reusable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane Chemically derived graphene (CDG) was prepared by hydrazine hydrate reduction of graphene oxide and used as support for palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) generated ex situ with controllable particle size and dispersion. The Pd NPs supported on CDG were well characterized by using a combination of advance analytical techniques and employed as catalyst in the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) in organic solvents and aqueous solutions, respectively. Monodisperse Pd NPs of 4.5 nm were prepared from the reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate by tert-butylamine borane in the presence of oleylamine. They were readily impregnated on CDG which has BET surface area of 500 m2 g−1. Pd NPs retain their particle size dispersion and stability when supported on chemically derived graphene. The resulting materials are highly active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of AB. In addition to their high activity and stability, these Pd NPs are also reusable catalyst in both dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of AB preserving 85% and 95% of initial activity after 5th and 10th runs, respectively.
