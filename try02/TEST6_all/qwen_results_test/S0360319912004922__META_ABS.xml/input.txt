Palladium nanoparticles supported on chemically derived graphene: An efficient and reusable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane Chemically derived graphene (CDG) was prepared by hydrazine hydrate reduction of graphene oxide and used as support for palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) generated ex situ with controllable particle size and dispersion. The Pd NPs supported on CDG were well characterized by using a combination of advance analytical techniques and employed as catalyst in the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) in organic solvents and aqueous solutions, respectively. Monodisperse Pd NPs of 4.5 nm were prepared from the reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate by tert-butylamine borane in the presence of oleylamine. They were readily impregnated on CDG which has BET surface area of 500 m2 g−1. Pd NPs retain their particle size dispersion and stability when supported on chemically derived graphene. The resulting materials are highly active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of AB. In addition to their high activity and stability, these Pd NPs are also reusable catalyst in both dehydrogenation and hydrolysis of AB preserving 85% and 95% of initial activity after 5th and 10th runs, respectively.
