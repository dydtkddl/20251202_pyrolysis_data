Chemical reaction engineering, process design and scale-up issues at the frontier of synthesis: Flow chemistry Flow chemistry has been proposed in modern organic chemistry as a mean for process intensification, to improve the control over reaction performance and to achieve higher yield. However, many open issues can be evidenced regarding the true possibility of scale-up, as well as currently lacking information for process design and economical evaluation. This review proposes some recent examples of flow synthesis deepening in particular the scale-up and engineering issues. Required information is evidenced, as well as some transport and kinetic data required for the practical implementation of the results.
