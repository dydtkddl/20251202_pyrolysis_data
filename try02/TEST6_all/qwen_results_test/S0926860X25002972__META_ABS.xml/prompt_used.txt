You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct conversion of ethene to isobutene using a combination of Ni-loaded amorphous silica-alumina and ferrierite zeolite catalysts Direct conversion of ethene to isobutene was studied by combining heterogeneous catalysts for ethene dimerization and skeletal isomerization of normal butene. NiO/SiO2-Al2O3 and zeolite were simultaneously loaded to a flow reactor in separate layers, and the conversion of ethene was performed at 300 ℃. Reaction using NiO/SiO2-Al2O3 alone produced normal butene predominantly, and isobutene selectivity was low at 1 %. However, introduction of zeolite into the lower catalyst phase greatly enhanced isobutene selectivity. The crystal structure and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of zeolite had marked influences on isobutene selectivity, and ferrierite with a moderate amount of acid sites was most effective. The activity of ferrierite was further increased by ion-exchange with metal ions such as Fe, which enhanced not only isobutene selectivity but also catalyst durability. Effects of the reaction conditions were also studied, with the optimal setup affording isobutene at a selectivity of 31 %, which is the highest selectivity reported to date.
