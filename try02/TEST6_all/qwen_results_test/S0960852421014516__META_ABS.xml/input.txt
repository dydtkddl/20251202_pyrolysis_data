Recent advances of thermochemical conversion processes for biorefinery Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most promising renewable resources and can replace fossil fuels via various biorefinery processes. Through this study, we addressed and analyzed recent advances in the thermochemical conversion of various lignocellulosic biomasses. We summarized the operation conditions and results related to each thermochemical conversion processes such as pyrolysis (torrefaction), hydrothermal treatment, gasification and combustion. This review indicates that using thermochemical conversion processes in biorefineries is techno-economically feasible, easy, and effective compared with biological processes. The challenges experienced in thermochemical conversion processes are also presented in this study for better understanding the future of thermochemical conversion processes for biorefinery. With the aid of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can reduce time-consumption and experimental work for bio-oil production and syngas production processes.
