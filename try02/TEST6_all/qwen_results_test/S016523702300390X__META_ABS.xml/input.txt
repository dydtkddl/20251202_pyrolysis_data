Bio-based cycloalkanes pyrolysis product analysis and reaction path calculation Bio-based aviation fuel has broad development prospects, but currently commercially used bio-based aviation fuel lacks aromatics and cycloalkanes, and must be mixed with traditional aviation fuels before it can be used in aero-engines. Therefore, the preparation of bio-based cycloalkanes and aromatics from lignin has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, four cycloalkanes with representative structures were selected to study their pyrolysis characteristics. They are cyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane and decalin. Then their pyrolysis characteristics were studied, the influence of branched chains and polycyclic rings on the pyrolysis characteristics was analyzed, and the pyrolysis path of the main products was deduced through the general principle of pyrolysis combined with product analysis. In addition, the main pyrolysis pathways are also calculated and verified. Finally, the pyrolysis mechanism and coking characteristics of cycloalkanes with different structures are summarized. The results showed that there were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ethylcyclohexane pyrolysis and decalin products, but cyclohexane and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane did not appear, indicating that ethylcyclohexane and decalin had Stronger coking tendency. Bicycloalkanes and monocycloalkanes with one side chain are more prone to thermal cracking reactions, have strong heat absorption capacity, and have stronger coking characteristics, while thermal cracking of multi-side chain monocycloalkanes is not easy to coke.
