You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-based cycloalkanes pyrolysis product analysis and reaction path calculation Bio-based aviation fuel has broad development prospects, but currently commercially used bio-based aviation fuel lacks aromatics and cycloalkanes, and must be mixed with traditional aviation fuels before it can be used in aero-engines. Therefore, the preparation of bio-based cycloalkanes and aromatics from lignin has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, four cycloalkanes with representative structures were selected to study their pyrolysis characteristics. They are cyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane and decalin. Then their pyrolysis characteristics were studied, the influence of branched chains and polycyclic rings on the pyrolysis characteristics was analyzed, and the pyrolysis path of the main products was deduced through the general principle of pyrolysis combined with product analysis. In addition, the main pyrolysis pathways are also calculated and verified. Finally, the pyrolysis mechanism and coking characteristics of cycloalkanes with different structures are summarized. The results showed that there were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ethylcyclohexane pyrolysis and decalin products, but cyclohexane and 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane did not appear, indicating that ethylcyclohexane and decalin had Stronger coking tendency. Bicycloalkanes and monocycloalkanes with one side chain are more prone to thermal cracking reactions, have strong heat absorption capacity, and have stronger coking characteristics, while thermal cracking of multi-side chain monocycloalkanes is not easy to coke.
