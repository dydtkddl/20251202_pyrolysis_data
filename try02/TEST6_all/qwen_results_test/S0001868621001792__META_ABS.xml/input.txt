Playing with sizes and shapes of colloidal particles via dry etching methods Monolayers of self-assembled quasi-spherical colloidal particles are essential building blocks in the field of materials science and engineering. More typically, they are used as a template for the fabrication of nanostructures if they serve, for instance, as a mask for deposition of new material on the surface on which particles are assembled or for etching of the material underneath; in this case, they are removed afterwards. This is what occurs in colloidal or nanosphere lithography. In some other cases, they are not used as a sacrificial material but they are incorporated in the final structure because they are inherently interesting for their properties. Independently of their specific use and application, different strategies have been devised in order to modify size and shape of colloidal particles, so as to enrich the variety of attainable patterns and to tailor the properties of the final structures and materials. In this review, we will focus on one of the most widespread methods to shape spherical colloidal particles, i.e. dry etching techniques. We will follow the development of such approaches until recent days, so as to trace an extensive panorama of the diverse parameters that can be harnessed to achieve specific morphological changes and highlight the characteristic features of the variants of this method. We will finally discuss how particles modified via dry etching can be used for patterning or can be resuspended in solvents for very diverse applications.
