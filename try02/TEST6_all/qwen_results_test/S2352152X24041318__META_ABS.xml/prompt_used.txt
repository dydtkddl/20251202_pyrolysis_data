You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal hydride reactors and phase change materials: Enhancing energy storage for medium-high power vehicles In recent years, the utilization of phase change materials (PCM) for heat supply and recovery has garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydride (MH) systems. This approach presents an efficient and innovative means of passive heat management, with considerable implications for energy storage applications. However, despite its potential, there remains a notable gap in research focusing on the ability of MH-PCM systems to facilitate high hydrogen flow rates, particularly for the demanding requirements of high-power fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). In this study, we address this gap by conducting a comprehensive numerical investigation into the dynamics of hydrogen supply to a fuel cell utilizing a 1 kg H2 stored in AB2-type MH-PCM (RT35) system. Our analysis includes a rigorous sensitivity assessment, probing the PCM and MH properties, as well as operating conditions, crucial for enabling the hydrogen storage system to sustain continuous H2 flow rates capable of meeting the power demands of FCVs ranging from 5 to 30 kW. Our findings reveal that the studied MH-PCM systems exhibit promising capabilities, demonstrating the ability to deliver a steady H2 flow rate to a 30 kW FC for a duration of 9 min, while utilizing only 24 % of the maximum H2 storage capacity. Notably, by reducing the requested H2 flow rate to 10 kW, we observed a significant enhancement in FC operational time by 362 %, with 38 % of hydrogen remaining usable. Moreover, our investigation highlights the efficacy of a periodic mode of operation, wherein the MH bed is replenished with H2 during designated “off” periods, leading to further improvements in H2 utilization factor and operation time at constant FC power. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of MH-PCM systems to dynamically supply H2 under highly variable load profiles, as exemplified by the VDI60 driving test. In essence, our study underscores the considerable potential of MH-PCM systems as a dynamic and efficient solution for energy storage in the power modules of heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles, thus paving the way for their integration into real-world applications.
