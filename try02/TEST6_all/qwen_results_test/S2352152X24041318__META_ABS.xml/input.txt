Metal hydride reactors and phase change materials: Enhancing energy storage for medium-high power vehicles In recent years, the utilization of phase change materials (PCM) for heat supply and recovery has garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydride (MH) systems. This approach presents an efficient and innovative means of passive heat management, with considerable implications for energy storage applications. However, despite its potential, there remains a notable gap in research focusing on the ability of MH-PCM systems to facilitate high hydrogen flow rates, particularly for the demanding requirements of high-power fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). In this study, we address this gap by conducting a comprehensive numerical investigation into the dynamics of hydrogen supply to a fuel cell utilizing a 1 kg H2 stored in AB2-type MH-PCM (RT35) system. Our analysis includes a rigorous sensitivity assessment, probing the PCM and MH properties, as well as operating conditions, crucial for enabling the hydrogen storage system to sustain continuous H2 flow rates capable of meeting the power demands of FCVs ranging from 5 to 30 kW. Our findings reveal that the studied MH-PCM systems exhibit promising capabilities, demonstrating the ability to deliver a steady H2 flow rate to a 30 kW FC for a duration of 9 min, while utilizing only 24 % of the maximum H2 storage capacity. Notably, by reducing the requested H2 flow rate to 10 kW, we observed a significant enhancement in FC operational time by 362 %, with 38 % of hydrogen remaining usable. Moreover, our investigation highlights the efficacy of a periodic mode of operation, wherein the MH bed is replenished with H2 during designated “off” periods, leading to further improvements in H2 utilization factor and operation time at constant FC power. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of MH-PCM systems to dynamically supply H2 under highly variable load profiles, as exemplified by the VDI60 driving test. In essence, our study underscores the considerable potential of MH-PCM systems as a dynamic and efficient solution for energy storage in the power modules of heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles, thus paving the way for their integration into real-world applications.
