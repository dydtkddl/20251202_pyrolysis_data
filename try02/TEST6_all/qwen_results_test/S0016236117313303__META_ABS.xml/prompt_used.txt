You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Predicting molecular composition of primary product derived from fast pyrolysis of lignin with semi-detailed kinetic model A numerical approach is presented for predicting the yields of char and volatile components obtained from fast pyrolysis of three types of lignin (enzymatic hydrolysis lignin, EHL; organic extracted lignin, OEL; and Klason lignin, KL) in a two-stage tubular reactor (TS-TR) at 773–1223 K. The heating rate of lignin particle in the TS-TR was estimated at 102–104 K/s by solving the heat transfer equation. The pyrolytic behavior of lignin and the formation of products in the temperature rising process were predicted using a semi-detailed kinetic model consisting of 93 species and 406 reactions, and the predicted yields of 8 primary products (i.e., char, tar, CO, CO2, H2O, CH3OH, C2H6, and C3H6) were compared with experimental data for the critical evaluation. For EHL, the predicted yields of char and H2O were in good agreement with the experimental results at all temperatures. However, the numerical simulation overestimated tar yield and underestimated CO yield at high temperature probably due to a lack of the kinetic model of the tar cracking reaction. The predicted yields of CH3OH, C2H6, and C3H6 were close to the experimental values at high temperature by adding the detailed chemical kinetic model of the secondary vapor-phase reaction. Moreover, the model reproduced the experimental observation that among the three types of lignin the char yield increased in the order of EHL < OEL < KL, whereas the tar yield decreased.
