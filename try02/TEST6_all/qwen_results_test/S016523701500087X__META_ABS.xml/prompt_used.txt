You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic study of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pyrolysis in a spouted bed reactor A spouted bed reactor has been designed and constructed to study the kinetic of the pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), in the temperature range of 450–560°C. The kinetic parameters were determined based on the weight change of the PET sample and were fitted successfully to a first-order kinetic model. Two particle sizes have been considered (0.1–1.0mm and 1.0–3.0mm) in order to study the role of heat and mass transfer limitations probably existed which affect the kinetic parameters. The results confirm a good performance of spouted bed in performing kinetic study of PET pyrolysis at high temperatures. The activation energy of 276.8 and 264.3kJ/mol was determined for particle size ranges of 0.1–1.0 and 1.0–3.0mm, respectively. The similarity between data for the different two particle size ranges revealed that the heat and mass transfer limitations in spouted bed reactors may have been minimized. The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis of PET were evaluated applying isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In such an analysis, the apparent activation energy observed were within the range of 245–292kJ/mol, for different particle sizes studied. There is a good agreement between the data obtained in this study with the values reported in the literature.
