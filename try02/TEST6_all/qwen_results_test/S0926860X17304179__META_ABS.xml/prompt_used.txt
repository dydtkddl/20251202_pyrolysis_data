You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

SAPO-18 and SAPO-34 catalysts for propylene production from the oligomerization-cracking of ethylene or 1-butene The performance of SAPO-18 and SAPO-34 catalysts has been compared during the conversion of ethylene or 1-butene to propylene. This comparison has been made in terms of activity (conversion), selectivity and stability against coke deposition. The SAPOs were synthesized, agglomerated, calcined, characterized and tested in a fixed-bed reactor at 500°C. The spent catalysts (after 5h on stream) were characterized to assign the location and nature of coke. The results point to the higher activity and stability of SAPO-18 catalyst in the conversions of each reactant (ethylene or 1-butene), which has been explained on the basis of its acidity, pore topology and above all, the faster diffusion of aromatics causing deactivation. Thus, the SAPO-18 catalyst suffers slower coke deposition, while this coke is of lighter nature (more aliphatic and less aromatic). The advantages of SAPO-18 over SAPO-34 catalyst are more relevant for the transformation of 1-butene, where the propylene selectivity and yield increase over time, as secondary reactions are selectively neglected and coke condensation is slowed down.
