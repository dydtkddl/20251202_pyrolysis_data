SAPO-18 and SAPO-34 catalysts for propylene production from the oligomerization-cracking of ethylene or 1-butene The performance of SAPO-18 and SAPO-34 catalysts has been compared during the conversion of ethylene or 1-butene to propylene. This comparison has been made in terms of activity (conversion), selectivity and stability against coke deposition. The SAPOs were synthesized, agglomerated, calcined, characterized and tested in a fixed-bed reactor at 500°C. The spent catalysts (after 5h on stream) were characterized to assign the location and nature of coke. The results point to the higher activity and stability of SAPO-18 catalyst in the conversions of each reactant (ethylene or 1-butene), which has been explained on the basis of its acidity, pore topology and above all, the faster diffusion of aromatics causing deactivation. Thus, the SAPO-18 catalyst suffers slower coke deposition, while this coke is of lighter nature (more aliphatic and less aromatic). The advantages of SAPO-18 over SAPO-34 catalyst are more relevant for the transformation of 1-butene, where the propylene selectivity and yield increase over time, as secondary reactions are selectively neglected and coke condensation is slowed down.
