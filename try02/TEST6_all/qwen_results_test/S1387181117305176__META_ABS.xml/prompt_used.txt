You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and catalytic performance of Cs/P modified ZSM-5 zeolite in aldol condensation of methyl acetate with different sources of formaldehyde A series of modified ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared for cross-aldol condensation of methyl acetate with formaldehyde - the simplest aldehyde without α-H for the production of methyl acrylate (MA). The active components, such as P and Cs, were selected to modify ZSM-5 and the effect of active component load on the catalyst acid-base properties was associated with the yield of MA. The catalysts were characterized with X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and NH3-TPD and changes of the catalyst structure and acid-base properties were explored. The thermodynamics calculation for the complex reaction was given to indicate the direction and the depth of the reaction. The formation of C-C bonds, key transition states and energy barrier were simulated to investigate the formation of ester enol form and the mechanism of aldol reaction process via quantum chemistry theory. Two forms of formaldehyde, namely, trioxymethylene and formalin, were applied to evaluate the catalysts in a fixed-bed micro-type reactor at the various reaction temperatures. The catalyst life and regeneration performance were investigated.
