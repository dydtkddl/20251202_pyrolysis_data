You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reduction kinetics of pure and industrial hematite samples with hydrogen in a small fixed bed system The steel industry is one of the most important industries in the world for manufacturing. Production relies on fossil-based processes mainly conducted in blast furnaces (BF), which use carbon monoxide to reduce the iron oxides in the ores. Globally, the industrial production of iron is responsible for about two gigatons of CO2 emissions on an annual basis. It is therefore imperative to reduce emissions to make the process more environmentally benign. Using hydrogen instead of carbon monoxide represents a promising solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The present work studies the kinetics and mass transfer phenomena during the reduction of pure and industrial hematite materials with hydrogen in a fixed-bed reactor. The overall reaction displays a complex behavior, which depends on the gas phase used, temperature, surface, and solid-phase phenomena. Significantly different behavior was observed for the different materials studied. To support the interpretation of the reduction data, morphological and chemical-physical characterization was performed on the solid phase at different stages of the reduction process. The information gathered contributes to the understanding of the complex overall reduction kinetics and the differences in the hematite materials of different origins.
