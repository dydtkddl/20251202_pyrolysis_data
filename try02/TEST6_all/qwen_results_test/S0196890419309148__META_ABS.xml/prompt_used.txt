You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis kinetics and reaction mechanism of representative non-charring polymer waste with micron particle size Pyrolysis is considered as a promising method to dispose polymer waste. To provide guidance for pyrolysis recycling of representative non-charring polymer namely poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) waste with micron particle size, the pyrolysis kinetics and reaction mechanism of micron PMMA waste in nitrogen are studied in the present study. Thermogravimetric analyses at 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 K/min coupled with two model-free methods including Senum-Yang and advanced Vyazovkin method as well as one model-fitting method namely Coats-Redfern method are employed. Results indicate that the micron PMMA waste pyrolysis may be nominally considered as one-step reaction. The reaction model and mechanism in charge of the micron PMMA waste pyrolysis may be g ( α ) = 1 - α - 1 / 2 - 1 and chemical reaction, respectively. The average values of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are 243.69 kJ/mol and 1.19 × 1019 min−1, respectively, which are both larger than those of traditional PMMA with particle size in millimeter or larger level. Based upon the one-step reaction model and the obtained kinetic parameters, the predicted thermogravimetric data agree well with the experimental results not only at heating rates of 5, 10 and 20 K/min which are employed to calculate the kinetic parameters, but also at heating rates of 30 and 40 K/min beyond those used to calculate the kinetic parameters.
