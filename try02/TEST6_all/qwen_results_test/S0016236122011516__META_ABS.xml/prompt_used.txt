You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study on biofuel produced from cracking of low density poly ethylenes using TiO2/AlSBA-15 nanocatalysts The burgeoning concerns over the non-biodegradable plastics wastes could be surpassed either by proper disposal technique or by an effective conversion of the plastic wastes into useful chemicals. Metal oxide; TiO2 and porous; AlSBA-15 catalysts were synthesized and a composite characterized using XRD, BET, N2 adsorption –desorption studies, TPD and SEM techniques. This work was focussed in the catalytic degradation of low density polyethylene over the synthesized catalysts in a fixed bed reactor. A hydrocarbon rich gasoline range of liquid fuel, coke and gas were the expected products from the experiment. The liquid products were analysed using GC MS equipped with J&W Scientific DB-Petro capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 m). An optimum yield of liquid fuel was obtained with TiO2 catalyst at 1st h of reaction and further the product yield considerably decreased. A marginal increase in % conversion of low density polyethylene into fuel was observed with increasing catalyst: polymer ratio in the presence of TiO2 catalyst till 1:5 ratio. The liquid products contained lower range of hydrocarbons with higher content of active catalyst; while the samples collected at later stage contained heavier components. Mesoporous AlSBA-15 worked comparatively better than TiO2 by converting 89.7% of LDPE into 54.8% combustible liquid products. The catalytic activity of the catalyst followed the order of TiO2/AlSBA-15 (10%) < AlSBA-15 (27) < SiSBA-15 < TiO2. A considerable increase in gasoline fraction from 45.6% to 85.4%, yield of liquid fuel (89.1%) and conversion (98.4%) was observed during cracking in the presence of TiO2/AlSBA-15 catalyst. Plastic liquid fuel produced over the composite catalyst revealed the calorific value of 47.8 MJ/Kg which was higher than the commercial petroleum fuel. Finally, we obtain this biofuel application as mathematical model to evaluate and plot the interaction energy arising from the conjugation of TiO2 - AlSBA-15 nano-catalyst in two possible configuration, linear (conical) and spherical molecules, along the range of the α distance ( z - a x i s ) .
