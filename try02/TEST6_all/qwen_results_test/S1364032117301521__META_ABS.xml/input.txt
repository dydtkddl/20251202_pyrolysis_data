Thermochemical routes for the valorization of waste polyolefinic plastics to produce fuels and chemicals. A review The continuous increase in the generation of waste plastics together with the need for developing more sustainable waste management policies have promoted a great research effort dealing with their valorization routes. In this review, the main thermochemical routes are analyzed for the valorization of waste polyolefins to produce chemicals and fuels. Amongst the different strategies, pyrolysis has received greater attention, but most studies are of preliminary character. Likewise, the studies pursuing the incorporation of waste plastics into refinery units (mainly fluid catalytic cracking and hydrocracking) have been carried out in batch laboratory-scale units. Other promising alternative to which great attention is being paid is the process based on two steps: pyrolysis and in-line intensification for olefin production by means of catalytic cracking or thermal cracking at high temperatures.
