You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of heterogeneous catalyst by ionically bonding macrocyclic Zr–Zr complex to montmorillonite clay for depolymerization of polypropylene The homonuclear macrocyclic Zr–Zr complex was synthesized by reacting 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with 1,2-phenylenediamine and zirconium oxychloride. The heterogeneous complex catalyst was prepared by ionically bonding it on zirconium pillared montmorillonite. The heterogeneous complex catalyst was shown to be stable at the depolymerizing temperature of polypropylene and the reaction product was a waxy solid alone without forming liquid and gaseous material. The FTIR analysis of this solid was shown to have exactly the same IR of the polypropylene indicating that the depolymerization occurs predominately by first formation of polymer radicals by random scission of the polypropylene chain. The chain radical, thus generated, combines with the catalyst to give a radical cation complex and the movement of this along its chain by bond shift reaction produces low molecular waxy product. Experiments have shown that the molecular weight of this waxy product depends upon the reaction temperature as well as the residence time and all its physical properties (melting point and solubility) can be matched with those of the paraffin wax.
