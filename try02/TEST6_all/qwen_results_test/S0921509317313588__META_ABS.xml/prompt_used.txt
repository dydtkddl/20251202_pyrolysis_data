You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Al alloy metal matrix composites reinforced by WS2 inorganic nanomaterials In the present work, advanced aluminium metal matrix composite reinforced by nanomaterials is reported. The materials used for the experiments are AA6061 aluminium alloy, compounded with inorganic nanotubes (INT) and fullerene-like (IF) nanoparticles of WS2. Aluminium metal matrix composite with different weight percentage (0.1–0.5wt%) of the INT and IF were prepared. Both the AA6061 aluminium and the aluminium metal matrix nanocomposites (MMCs) were re-melted by the stirring-casting method. Mechanical properties and microstructure analysis of the nano-MMCs were conducted. The measurements have shown that the hardness, yielding strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility were improved by up to 68% compared to the neat alloy for nanoparticles concentrations the range of 0.2wt%. Metallography microstructure analysis showed that increasing the WS2 INT or IF nanoparticles weight percentage in aluminium metal matrix composite, resulted in a more refined grains. The grain size of the composite matrix was reduced by up to 48.4% compared with that of neat AA6061 alloy ingot. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed that addition of 0.5wt% of WS2 nanotubes into the Al matrix resulted in INT agglomeration which had deleterious effect on the tensile strength. The composite materials reinforcement mechanism was studied. This analysis showed that the improved mechanical properties of the metal nanocomposites can be predominantly attributed to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the WS2 INT (or WS2 IF nanoparticle) and the AA6061 alloy.
