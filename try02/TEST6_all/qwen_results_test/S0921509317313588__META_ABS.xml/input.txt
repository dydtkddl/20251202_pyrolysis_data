Al alloy metal matrix composites reinforced by WS2 inorganic nanomaterials In the present work, advanced aluminium metal matrix composite reinforced by nanomaterials is reported. The materials used for the experiments are AA6061 aluminium alloy, compounded with inorganic nanotubes (INT) and fullerene-like (IF) nanoparticles of WS2. Aluminium metal matrix composite with different weight percentage (0.1–0.5wt%) of the INT and IF were prepared. Both the AA6061 aluminium and the aluminium metal matrix nanocomposites (MMCs) were re-melted by the stirring-casting method. Mechanical properties and microstructure analysis of the nano-MMCs were conducted. The measurements have shown that the hardness, yielding strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility were improved by up to 68% compared to the neat alloy for nanoparticles concentrations the range of 0.2wt%. Metallography microstructure analysis showed that increasing the WS2 INT or IF nanoparticles weight percentage in aluminium metal matrix composite, resulted in a more refined grains. The grain size of the composite matrix was reduced by up to 48.4% compared with that of neat AA6061 alloy ingot. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed that addition of 0.5wt% of WS2 nanotubes into the Al matrix resulted in INT agglomeration which had deleterious effect on the tensile strength. The composite materials reinforcement mechanism was studied. This analysis showed that the improved mechanical properties of the metal nanocomposites can be predominantly attributed to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the WS2 INT (or WS2 IF nanoparticle) and the AA6061 alloy.
