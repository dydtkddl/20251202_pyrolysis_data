State-of-the-art strategies for microplastics mitigation in aquatic environments: Identification, technological innovations, and prospects for advancement Currently, the presence of plastic remnants poses a serious menace to the environment. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of advancements in microplastic particles (MPs) removal technologies from aquatic systems. Sophisticated techniques, including Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC–MS), Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), offer promising approaches for identifying and quantifying these particles. The core focus of this review is on removal technologies, where a comprehensive analysis of existing methods is provided. Mechanical methods, such as filtration and sedimentation, are assessed for their efficacy in capturing MPs. Chemical approaches, including coagulation and flocculation, are examined in terms of their potential to enhance removal efficiency. Advanced technologies, such as electrochemical and ultrasonic methods, are explored for their innovative contributions to MPs removal. The advantages and limitations of each removal technique are critically evaluated. While mechanical methods excel in large-scale applications, they may struggle with smaller MPs, and their efficiency can be influenced by factors like flow rates and water turbidity. Chemical methods exhibit promising results in enhancing removal efficiency but may introduce secondary pollutants. Advanced technologies show great potential but require further research to optimize their scalability and environmental impact. Future perspectives and recommendations are outlined to guide the development of effective and sustainable MPs removal strategies. Integration of multiple removal techniques, coupled with ongoing research on biodegradable alternatives, is proposed to address the limitations of individual methods.
