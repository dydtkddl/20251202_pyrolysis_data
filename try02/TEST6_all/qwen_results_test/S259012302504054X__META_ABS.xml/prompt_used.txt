You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pig bone-derived biochar from food industry waste for heavy metal remediation: Sustainable consumption and production This study investigates the sustainable conversion of abattoir waste into pig bone-derived biochar(PBC) through slow pyrolysis at temperatures of 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C under oxygen-limited conditions. Biochar produced at higher temperatures showed improved surface area, porosity, and hydroxyapatite crystallinity, as confirmed by BET, SEM-EDX, FTIR, and XRD analyses. PBC prepared at 500 °C demonstrated the highest Cu2+ adsorption capacity (59.4 mg/g, Toth isotherm model). Kinetic studies revealed that the Fractal-like Pseudo-First-Order (FL-PFO) model best described the adsorption process (R2 >0.999), outperforming conventional models. Equilibrium data fit the Toth isotherm most accurately, indicating heterogeneous surface energy, while Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson models provided secondary insights. Thermodynamic analysis confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption, with entropy increases suggesting interfacial structural changes. Desorption tests confirmed high reusability. Economically, PBC production is low-cost (∼1 USD/kg) with carbon-neutral to negative emissions under renewable energy use and a favorable social return on investment (SROI = 1.56). The study highlights the potential of biochar as an efficient, renewable, and low-cost adsorbent for decentralized wastewater treatment, especially in regions with significant livestock waste and limited treatment infrastructure. This work demonstrates a practical path toward waste valorization, environmental remediation, and socio-economic impact within a circular economy framework.
