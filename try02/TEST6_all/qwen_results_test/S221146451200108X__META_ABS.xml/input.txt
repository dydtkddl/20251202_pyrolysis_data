Potential application of pyrolysis for the effective valorisation of the end of life tires in Greece Used tires (UTs) are an abandon solid waste in Greece and worldwide which can be effectively transformed to valuable products and energy via pyrolysis. In this study, current status of both European and Greek Legislation on waste management with a special insight in tires is reported. The established Joint Alternative Management System (JAMS) for the alternative management of tires is described, along with the adopted valorization routes. The adopted Energy recovery routes in Greece are discussed with focus on pyrolysis. The main drawbacks of pyrolysis are identified and solutions are proposed for their effective implementation in the near future. Tires energy and material recovery are particularly favorable, with substantial benefits of energy savings, material recovery and high added materials production. Based on the existing extensive expertise in the pyrolysis of tires, an effort was made in order to identify the non-technical barriers for the further exploitation of pyrolysis as a promising valorization route in Greece. A SWOT analysis was further developed for the comparison of pyrolysis with combustion and the results are also presented.
