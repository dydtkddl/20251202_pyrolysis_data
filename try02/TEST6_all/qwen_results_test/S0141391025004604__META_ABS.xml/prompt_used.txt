You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic study of enzymatic hydrolysis of poly(butylene succinate)/poly(pentamethylene 2,5-furanoate)-based blend and block copolymer Poly(butylene succinate)(PBS) and poly(pentamethylene 2,5-furanoate)(PPeF) are bio-based polymers that proved to be compatible to derive versatile blends. The different mechanical properties resulting from their combinations respond to the diverse needs in food packaging. While already their physical blending lead to products with good flexibility, copolymers showed further improved elasticity while maintaining good gas barrier properties. The possibility of being fully degraded through hydrolytic enzymes places an additional advantage to the fully green potential of these polymers. The two homopolymers, their physical blend as well as copolymer were demonstrated to be decomposed by the Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) reaching 100 % of weight loss after 24 h of incubation. PBS was hydrolysed faster than PPeF, while, interestingly, at 50 % content of each polymer, the physical blend was more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than the copolymer, as resulted from weight loss and HPLC quantification of the released monomers. This trend was even more pronounced related to reduction of molecular weight during the first phase of hydrolysis as indicated by Gel Permeation Chromatography analysis. Surface characterization of the polymers during hydrolysis by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy likewise confirmed faster hydrolysis of PBS moieties. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance highlighted slower appearance of hydrolysis-related groups in the copolymer when compared to the physical blend. Overall, this mechanistic study indicates that blending or synthetizing copolymers can influence enzymatic hydrolysis with important implications towards exploitation of enzymes as an environmentally benign emerging technology for recycling.
