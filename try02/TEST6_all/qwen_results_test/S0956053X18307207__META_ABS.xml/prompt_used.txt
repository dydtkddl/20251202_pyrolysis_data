You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

End-of-life of silicon PV panels: A sustainable materials recovery process In this paper, the management of end-of-life PV modules based on an advanced eco-sustainable process has been presented and discussed. The thermal removal of the polymeric compounds contained in c-Si PV modules has been investigated to separate and recover Si, Ag, Cu, Al and glass. A two-step thermal process has been employed. In the first step, the rear polymeric layer has been removed without emissions of dangerous fluorinated substances. In the second step, the remaining polymers have been completely removed with low volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. The polymers degradation has been studied at combustion equivalent ratios Φ varying from 0.5 to 2 and at 500 °C. The materials recovery has been evaluated from an environmental point of view and optimized by considering the energy cost, through the identification of the best operating conditions, in terms of temperature, time, atmosphere and gas flow. One hour of heat treatment and a slightly oxidizing atmosphere have been enabled to separate and recover the different materials of the module. The elemental compositions of the PV sample and the residue condensed organic products have been determined. The gaseous degradation products have been characterized by gas chromatographic analysis (GC).
