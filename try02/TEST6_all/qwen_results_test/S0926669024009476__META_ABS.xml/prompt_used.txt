You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of Baltic wheat straw and low-density polyethylene bags and its kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour Wheat cultivation represents about 42 % of the total cereal cultivation area in the Baltic Sea region, generating huge amounts of wheat straw (WS) that needs to be optimally managed. In this context, this research aims to investigate the extent of using pyrolysis process in WS valorization. The experiments were performed using a thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer on WS and its mixtures with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags at different mixing ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4). The released TG vapours were monitored using TG-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The thermochemical activation energy (Ea) were studied by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Friedman, and Vyazovkin models. The pyrolysis results showed that WS and LDPE could be completely decomposed as a single reaction up to 600 °C and 520 °C, respectively. Aromatic-carbonyl and CO2 were the main FTIR functional group for WS vapour versus -CH2- for LEDP vapour. The GC/MS analysis of WS showed various compounds such as sec-Butylamine (11.88 %), acetic acid (10.68 %), etc., while LDPE showed many compounds without specific trend even when the heating rate was changed. While the co-pyrolysis results showed that WS/LDPE could be decomposed individually in two successive reactions at 335 °C (WS) and 495 °C (LDPE). These results were confirmed by FTIR and GC/MS which showed that the functional groups and chemical compounds of vapour generated at these decomposition zones have similar characteristics to those obtained from pyrolysis of WS and LDPE. Finally, kinetic analysis showed that WS-Baltic (227–250 kJ/mol) is more complex compared to WS-Asian (163–217 kJ/mol) due to its higher ash content. While Ea of WS/LDPE was increases upto 274–291 kJ/mol (1:1), 266–297 kJ/mol (2:1), 268–289 kJ/mol (3:1), and 278–299 kJ/mol (1:4). Also, the enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy coefficients of WS were increased by mixing (1:1) up to 272 J/mol K, while its entropy does not change much by mixing (367 J/mol K). Accordingly, the co-pyrolysis process is a key technology in valorization of WS and convert into value-added chemicals and a sustainable energy source.
