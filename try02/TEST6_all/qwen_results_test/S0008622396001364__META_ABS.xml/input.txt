Carbonization of wood for advanced materials applications A unique process for conversion of monolithic wood structures to carbons that retain the cellular structure of the wood without the formation of cracks and other defects associated with charcoal materials is described. A variety of wood species are carbonized to produce the materials which are characterized using TGA, density, dimensional changes, acoustic velocity, SEM and mechanical testing. We demonstrate that through controlled pyrolysis monolithic carbonized wood can be produced without the macro-cracks normally associated with charcoal. A linear relationship is established between the bulk densities of wood and carbonized wood which spans the entire range of species. For the conditions presented, the carbonized wood had 82% of the bulk density of the precursor wood. Carbonized wood acoustic velocity ranged from 4.7 to 1.3 mm/μs for Tilia americana and Ochroma pyramidale, respectively. Carbonization resulted in decreased acoustic velocity in the axial principal direction and increases in the radial and tangential directions. Acoustic anisotropy was retained through carbonization, but reduced in magnitude. Mechanical testing showed the carbonized wood to be 28% stronger than the precursor. The cellular morphology of the porous carbonized wood is described and compared to carbon foams.
