You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbonization of wood for advanced materials applications A unique process for conversion of monolithic wood structures to carbons that retain the cellular structure of the wood without the formation of cracks and other defects associated with charcoal materials is described. A variety of wood species are carbonized to produce the materials which are characterized using TGA, density, dimensional changes, acoustic velocity, SEM and mechanical testing. We demonstrate that through controlled pyrolysis monolithic carbonized wood can be produced without the macro-cracks normally associated with charcoal. A linear relationship is established between the bulk densities of wood and carbonized wood which spans the entire range of species. For the conditions presented, the carbonized wood had 82% of the bulk density of the precursor wood. Carbonized wood acoustic velocity ranged from 4.7 to 1.3 mm/μs for Tilia americana and Ochroma pyramidale, respectively. Carbonization resulted in decreased acoustic velocity in the axial principal direction and increases in the radial and tangential directions. Acoustic anisotropy was retained through carbonization, but reduced in magnitude. Mechanical testing showed the carbonized wood to be 28% stronger than the precursor. The cellular morphology of the porous carbonized wood is described and compared to carbon foams.
