You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel method of reclaiming high-value carbon fiber from waste epoxy composite via molten salt thermal treatment Epoxy resin limits the recycling of high-value carbon fibers from waste epoxy composites: its inferior thermal conductivity requires the excessive pulverization of the polymers, reducing fibers length; its robust cross-linked structure hinders its removal, leading to fiber contamination. Here, we proposed a novel method by using molten salts as an effective medium to enhance heat transfer and thermal reaction. The length and structural integrity of fibers were preserved by minimizing the extent of pulverization and reducing the erosive impact of resin degradation products, respectively. At 375 °C, the resin removal ratio and fiber strength retention both exceeded 99%, with a temperature reduction of at least 100 °C. Molten salts exerted differential inert and active effects on fibers and resin. Fibers could retain 97% of strength retention within salts at 400 °C for 2 h. Conversely, molten salts significantly facilitated the disruption of the resin matrix’s cross-linked structure by catalyzing the cleavage of C-N bonds. The degradation products exhibited a lightweight tendency and could be easily separated from the fiber surface in the fluid environment provided by molten salts, thus protecting the fiber surface against oxidative erosion caused by phenols.
