A novel method of reclaiming high-value carbon fiber from waste epoxy composite via molten salt thermal treatment Epoxy resin limits the recycling of high-value carbon fibers from waste epoxy composites: its inferior thermal conductivity requires the excessive pulverization of the polymers, reducing fibers length; its robust cross-linked structure hinders its removal, leading to fiber contamination. Here, we proposed a novel method by using molten salts as an effective medium to enhance heat transfer and thermal reaction. The length and structural integrity of fibers were preserved by minimizing the extent of pulverization and reducing the erosive impact of resin degradation products, respectively. At 375 °C, the resin removal ratio and fiber strength retention both exceeded 99%, with a temperature reduction of at least 100 °C. Molten salts exerted differential inert and active effects on fibers and resin. Fibers could retain 97% of strength retention within salts at 400 °C for 2 h. Conversely, molten salts significantly facilitated the disruption of the resin matrix’s cross-linked structure by catalyzing the cleavage of C-N bonds. The degradation products exhibited a lightweight tendency and could be easily separated from the fiber surface in the fluid environment provided by molten salts, thus protecting the fiber surface against oxidative erosion caused by phenols.
