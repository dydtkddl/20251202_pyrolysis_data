You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced hard carbon materials for practical applications of sodium-ion batteries developed by combined experimental, computational, and data analysis approaches Hard carbon materials are considered one of the ideal anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical application of hard carbon materials is limited by complex microstructures and imprecise preparation techniques. On the one hand, advanced hard carbon materials are widely developed through computational simulations and experimental research. On the other hand, the emerging database of precursors − preparation parameters − microstructures − and electrochemical performance has grown fast as more and more research has been reported. The database is greatly beneficial to reducing the trial-and-error nature of the experiments and verifying the reliability of the computational results. In this review, we summarize the rapid development of high-performance hard carbon materials by combining experimental, computational, and data analysis approaches. Focusing on: 1) summarizing the types of precursors and preparation methods to search the development of highly promising precursors and efficient preparation methods, 2) discussing the evolution rule of microstructure parameters and elucidating the correspondence between microstructures and sodium storage mechanisms, 3) revealing the relationship between microstructure characteristics and electrochemical performance of hard carbon, and 4) summarizing the utility potential of various modification strategies on hard carbon. Finally, we outline the main advances and future perspectives of hard carbon in SIBs.
