You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A step towards rational design of hierarchical porous MOFs architectures for emerging practical implementations Hierarchical porous metal–organic frameworks (HPMOFs) are a new family of highly crystalline inorganic/organic materials with structural diversity beyond conventional solid-state materials. Due to tunable porosity, metal nodes, fascinating nanoarchitecture, diverse coordination geometry, and unique properties, HPMOFs have captured the interest of scientists for applications in catalysis, water remediations, sensing, energy storage, nanomedicines, gas storage, and separation, which require rationally designed micro/nanostructures. The synthesis of multimodal HPMOFs with custom structures and morphologies is still challenging in materials science and chemistry. Much research has been done in the past few years focused on contemplating the construction of multifunctional HPMOFs with suitable functions to expand the applications of pristine MOFs. This review aims to explore the emerging class of HPMOFs, highlighting recent advancements in their synthesis focusing on bottom-up and top-down strategies, emphasizing their structural diversity, tailorable structures, tunable porosities, and effectiveness toward various applications. It also provides insights into the comparison of HPMOFs with conventional microporous MOFs, making them ideal for sustainable advancements. Lastly, it also presents a comprehensive summary of current challenges and future prospects that hold promise to pave the way for practical applications of HPMOFs and alleviate unsolved problems in this field.
