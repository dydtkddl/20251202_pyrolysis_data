A step towards rational design of hierarchical porous MOFs architectures for emerging practical implementations Hierarchical porous metal–organic frameworks (HPMOFs) are a new family of highly crystalline inorganic/organic materials with structural diversity beyond conventional solid-state materials. Due to tunable porosity, metal nodes, fascinating nanoarchitecture, diverse coordination geometry, and unique properties, HPMOFs have captured the interest of scientists for applications in catalysis, water remediations, sensing, energy storage, nanomedicines, gas storage, and separation, which require rationally designed micro/nanostructures. The synthesis of multimodal HPMOFs with custom structures and morphologies is still challenging in materials science and chemistry. Much research has been done in the past few years focused on contemplating the construction of multifunctional HPMOFs with suitable functions to expand the applications of pristine MOFs. This review aims to explore the emerging class of HPMOFs, highlighting recent advancements in their synthesis focusing on bottom-up and top-down strategies, emphasizing their structural diversity, tailorable structures, tunable porosities, and effectiveness toward various applications. It also provides insights into the comparison of HPMOFs with conventional microporous MOFs, making them ideal for sustainable advancements. Lastly, it also presents a comprehensive summary of current challenges and future prospects that hold promise to pave the way for practical applications of HPMOFs and alleviate unsolved problems in this field.
