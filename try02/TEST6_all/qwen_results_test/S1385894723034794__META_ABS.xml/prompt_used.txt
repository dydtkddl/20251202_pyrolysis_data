You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-thermal plasma assisted catalytic nitrogen fixation with methane at ambient conditions Sustainable and economical nitrogen (N2) fixation could offset the significant environmental and societal costs associated with the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. Yet, limited progress from these routes has been made to-date given unresolved low ammonia yield and complicated reaction pathways. The threshold efficiency required for a non-thermal plasma (NTP) process to become competitive is established for various scenarios of hydrogen sources with CO2-free renewable energy. Herein, we report a novel non-thermal plasma driven N2 fixation pathway with methane (CH4) over a low-cost Cu/SiO2 catalyst to form a high ammonia yield of almost 7% as well as value-added hydrogen, gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons as byproducts. The presence of CH4 promoted the N2 fixation degree by up to 17%. Both experimental and computational work performed in this study reveals that plasma driven CH4 and N2 activation induced the formation of highly energetic electrons in the plasma regime and the thereafter produced active species reacted on the copper nanoparticle surface dispersed on the outer surface of the silica support, securing good catalytic activity and stability. A coincidence between theoretical simulation and experimental data provides significant insights into rational design of charged catalyst for facilitating non-thermal plasma assisted N2 fixation with natural gas directly and unfold novel avenues for sustainable technology development through potential renewability and zero-carbon emission approach.
