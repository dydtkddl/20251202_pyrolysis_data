You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modifier-assisted co-thermal carbonization of lignite for hard carbon with enriched pseudo-graphitic domains and closed pores toward enhanced sodium storage Lignite, characterized by disordered aromatic lamellae, natural pores and microfractures, and surface-active functional groups, has emerged as a high-quality precursor for advanced hard carbon anodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, we propose a modifier-assisted co-thermal carbonization strategy to precisely tailor the pseudo-graphitic domains and closed pores in lignite-derived hard carbons (LHC), aiming to enhance their Na+ storage capabilities. Through incorporating urea during carbonization, the resulting nitrogen-doped lignite-based hard carbon (N-LHC) possesses a high content of pseudo-graphitic domains (43.6 %), an optimized interlayer distance (0.373 nm), and a greater number of closed pores interconnected by short-range ordered microcrystals. Benefiting from these structural and chemical modifications, the N-LHC anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 380 mAh·g−1, with the plateau capacity of 207 mA g−1 and an improved initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 79.1 %. When paired with a NaFe1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode, the full-cell achieves a notable energy density of 240.8 Wh·kg−1 at 20 mA g−1 and retains 157.5 Wh·kg−1 at 200 mA g−1 with a power density of 230.7 W kg−1. Electrochemical kinetics combined with ex-situ X-ray diffraction analyses reveal a synergistic sodium storage mechanism involving adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling. DFT calculations further confirm the critical role of heteroatoms doping in enhancing Na+ adsorption kinetics and overall storage capacity. This work provides an effective strategy for engineering advanced hard carbon anodes toward practical high-energy-density SIBs.
