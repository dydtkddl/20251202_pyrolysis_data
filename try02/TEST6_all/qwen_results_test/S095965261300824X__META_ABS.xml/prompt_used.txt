You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of porous carbons derived from sustainable palm solid waste for carbon dioxide capture Potentials of solid agro-wastes from palm processing mills (palm kernel) for producing low cost porous carbons were investigated. The study deals with the use of palm kernel shell based porous carbons as adsorbents for CO2 capture. Carbonization of the palm kernel shell (PKS) was carried out at 700 °C followed by CO2 activation. The porous carbons were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric (TG/DTA) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and nitrogen adsorption tests. The adsorption equilibrium of CO2 on palm kernel shell activated carbon was measured using a static volumetric technique. Adsorption of CO2 on the porous carbons was conducted at 30 °C for pressures up to 4 bars. The equilibrium data were simulated using the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, with both models having R 2 > 0.98. The experimental kinetic data was fitted to the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and Elovich equations, while the adsorption mechanism was evaluated using the Webber-Moris intra-particle diffusion model. Higher CO2 uptake of 7.32 mmol/g was obtained for PAC (palm kernel activated carbon) at 30 °C and 4 bars. PAC adsorbed 23.52 kg CO2/t PKS. The findings revealed the potential of palm shell as a viable and sustainable biomass for preparation of activated carbon for gas adsorption applications.
