You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Methane pyrolysis by Joule heating for graphitic carbon and hydrogen production The global energy transition toward sustainability requires technologies that can decarbonize energy carriers and fuels while producing valuable materials. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, is both a high-energy-density fuel and a significant greenhouse gas. This study reports an approach for methane pyrolysis utilizing Joule heating within the deposition substrate to drive the endothermic reaction. With electric current passing through a resistive porous carbon cloth, heat is generated to break C-H bonds of methane molecules. The decomposition of methane as it flows through the cloth results in hydrogen production and the formation of conformally layered graphite around the carbon fibers. The effects of input power, chamber pressure, feedstock flow rate, and process duration on hydrogen and graphite production are characterized via in situ mass spectrometry and laser absorption spectroscopy, resulting in methane conversion rates up to 88%, with hydrogen and carbon yields of 82% and 72%, respectively. Material characterization verifies uniform high-quality graphite deposition, with a Raman I D /I G ratio of 0.1 and 3.38 Å d-spacing. This Joule heating method for catalyst-free methane pyrolysis offers the potential for advancing hydrogen production technology by simultaneously producing valuable materials such as solid graphite, thus enhancing the economic viability of the fuel decarbonization process.
