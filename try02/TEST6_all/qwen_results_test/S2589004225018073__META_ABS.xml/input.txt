Methane pyrolysis by Joule heating for graphitic carbon and hydrogen production The global energy transition toward sustainability requires technologies that can decarbonize energy carriers and fuels while producing valuable materials. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, is both a high-energy-density fuel and a significant greenhouse gas. This study reports an approach for methane pyrolysis utilizing Joule heating within the deposition substrate to drive the endothermic reaction. With electric current passing through a resistive porous carbon cloth, heat is generated to break C-H bonds of methane molecules. The decomposition of methane as it flows through the cloth results in hydrogen production and the formation of conformally layered graphite around the carbon fibers. The effects of input power, chamber pressure, feedstock flow rate, and process duration on hydrogen and graphite production are characterized via in situ mass spectrometry and laser absorption spectroscopy, resulting in methane conversion rates up to 88%, with hydrogen and carbon yields of 82% and 72%, respectively. Material characterization verifies uniform high-quality graphite deposition, with a Raman I D /I G ratio of 0.1 and 3.38 Å d-spacing. This Joule heating method for catalyst-free methane pyrolysis offers the potential for advancing hydrogen production technology by simultaneously producing valuable materials such as solid graphite, thus enhancing the economic viability of the fuel decarbonization process.
