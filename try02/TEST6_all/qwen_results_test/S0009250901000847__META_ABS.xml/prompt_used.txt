You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface organometallic investigation of the mechanism of ethylene polymerization by silica-supported Cr catalysts The Phillips family of one-component catalysts, created by the interaction of a inorganic chromium compound such as CrO3 and an oxide support, typically silica, initiates ethylene polymerization in the absence of alkylaluminum activators. Despite intense scrutiny since its discovery over four decades ago, the nature of the active site has remained obscure and the mechanism of olefin polymerization ill-defined. Spectroscopic studies of the working catalyst are hampered by low active site densities. To circumvent this problem, we have prepared well-defined organochromium fragments, supported on silica, which manifest remarkably similar activity to the CrO3/SiO2 catalyst, and produce similar high-density polyethylene. The uniform nature of the active sites has made possible a kinetic investigation of the mechanism of polymerization. Our evidence points to alkylchromium(IV) active centers, bound to silica by two Si–O–Cr linkages, which coordinate ethylene by displacement of a surface siloxane. Insertion of the coordinated olefin into one of two growing alkyl chains occurs provided there is no α-substituent. The information thus obtained may be used to understand the relationship between active site structure, catalyst activity and polymer properties.
