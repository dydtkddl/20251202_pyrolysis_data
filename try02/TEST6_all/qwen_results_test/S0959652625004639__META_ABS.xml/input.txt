Removal of microplastics in sludge during intensive treatment processes in a wastewater treatment plant in China Wastewater treatment plants contribute to mitigating microplastic pollution by capturing the majority of the microplastics present in the influent and depositing them into the sewage sludge. To date, few researchers have studied the fate of sludge-borne microplastics through the full life cycle of the sludge treatment process in wastewater treatment plants. The aim of this study therefore, was to fill this knowledge gap. We collected sludge samples from the pre-dewatering (centrifuge dewatering), thermal hydrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and plate-frame dewatering treatment stages. We then identified the microplastics in the sludge using a laser direct infrared chemical imaging system and evaluated their removal in chamber experiments. The microplastic abundances ranged from 460.18 to 7667.32 particles/g, with most consisting of polyvinyl chloride (PVC, 41.49%–43.56%), polypropylene (PP, 21.54%–25.57%), and acrylates (7.73%–8.89%). The particle sizes were predominantly between 20 and 100 μm and over 55% of the microplastics were fragments. Notably, 61%–78% of the microplastics in the original sludge were removed during the treatment processes, because of transference during the pre-dewatering stage and depolymerization during thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion. Despite the reduction, and even though 4.92 × 1015 microplastic particles were removed from the sludge in the Beijing area during the treatment, we estimated that approximately 2.54 × 1015 microplastics were released into the environment around Beijing annually. The information from this study could contribute to improving sludge treatment techniques; for example, additional pre-dewatering could be added to the process to enhance the removal of microplastics.
