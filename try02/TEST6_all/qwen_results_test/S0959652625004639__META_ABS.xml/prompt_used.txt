You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of microplastics in sludge during intensive treatment processes in a wastewater treatment plant in China Wastewater treatment plants contribute to mitigating microplastic pollution by capturing the majority of the microplastics present in the influent and depositing them into the sewage sludge. To date, few researchers have studied the fate of sludge-borne microplastics through the full life cycle of the sludge treatment process in wastewater treatment plants. The aim of this study therefore, was to fill this knowledge gap. We collected sludge samples from the pre-dewatering (centrifuge dewatering), thermal hydrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and plate-frame dewatering treatment stages. We then identified the microplastics in the sludge using a laser direct infrared chemical imaging system and evaluated their removal in chamber experiments. The microplastic abundances ranged from 460.18 to 7667.32 particles/g, with most consisting of polyvinyl chloride (PVC, 41.49%–43.56%), polypropylene (PP, 21.54%–25.57%), and acrylates (7.73%–8.89%). The particle sizes were predominantly between 20 and 100 μm and over 55% of the microplastics were fragments. Notably, 61%–78% of the microplastics in the original sludge were removed during the treatment processes, because of transference during the pre-dewatering stage and depolymerization during thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion. Despite the reduction, and even though 4.92 × 1015 microplastic particles were removed from the sludge in the Beijing area during the treatment, we estimated that approximately 2.54 × 1015 microplastics were released into the environment around Beijing annually. The information from this study could contribute to improving sludge treatment techniques; for example, additional pre-dewatering could be added to the process to enhance the removal of microplastics.
