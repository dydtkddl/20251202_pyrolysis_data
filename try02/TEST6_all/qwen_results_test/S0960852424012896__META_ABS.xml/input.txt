Biotechnological trends and optimization of Arachis hypogaea residues valorization: A bibliometric analysis and comprehensive review This review thoroughly explores the valorization of Arachis hypogaea (groundnut) residues for producing high-value bioproducts such as biofuels, biocatalysts, biochar, and nanomaterials through processes like pyrolysis, gasification, and enzymatic conversion. Optimization techniques, including Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), have led to significant enhancements in bioproduct yields. A detailed bibliometric analysis spanning from 2000 to the present highlights key research trends and influential contributors, reflecting the increasing global focus on groundnut residue valorization. The study emphasizes the environmental and economic benefits, such as improved waste management, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and contributions to a circular bioeconomy. It advocates for policy frameworks that support these biotechnological advancements and recommends further research on process scalability, long-term stability, and life cycle assessments to ensure the environmental and economic viability of groundnut residue utilization in sustainable development.
