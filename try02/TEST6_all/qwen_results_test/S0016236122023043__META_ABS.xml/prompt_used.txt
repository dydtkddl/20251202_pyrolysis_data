You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the influence of calcium on the co-pyrolysis of coal and polystyrene In this paper, the influence of calcium on the co-pyrolysis of coal and polystyrene (PS) is investigated by reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) method. The experimental results show the same trend of products variation as the pyrolysis simulation. The results show that the presence of calcium in the coal sample significantly promotes the co-pyrolysis process. The addition of calcium greatly enhances the rapid cracking of coal/PS into small molecular fragments within 2000–2600 K, leading to the high yield of light tar. The slow weight loss of oxygen-containing char and high CO yield, as well as the sharp rise of oxygen-free tar, suggest the promotion of calcium on the conversion of tar to char in coal pyrolysis and the positive effect on PS pyrolysis. Moreover, the delayed release of OH radicals in coal and early release of H radicals in PS during coal(Ca)/PS co-pyrolysis present the strong binding effect of Ca-containing species on free radicals in coal and the promotion effect of calcium on PS pyrolysis. Furthermore, the low C8H8 yield in the early stage during coal(Ca)/PS co-pyrolysis, along with the phenomenon that H radicals are released early, proves that calcium-containing compounds enhance benzene ring dehydrogenation or the breaking of CC bonds in PS. By using the first-order reaction model, the kinetic parameters for the co-pyrolysis of coal/PS and coal(Ca)/PS are quantitatively determined.
