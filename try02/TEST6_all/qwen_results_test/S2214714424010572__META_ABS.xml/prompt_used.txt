You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of the competitive effect on the adsorption of phenol and 4-nitrophenol in a batch reactor and fixed-bed column using coconut shell activated carbon In this study, the kinetics and isotherms of mono- and multi-component adsorption of phenol (PN) and 4-nitrophenol (4NP) in aqueous solution were determined in a batch reactor, followed by tests in a fixed-bed column. The adsorbent used was coconut shell activated carbon. The characterization of the adsorbent showed a suitable surface area (724 m2 g−1), pore volume (0.39 cm3 g−1), and average pore diameter of 21.35 Å. Surface characterization revealed the predominance of basic surface groups resulting from the physical activation process. In the monocomponent kinetic assays, PN was completely removed in 25 min, whereas 4NP took 45 min. In the case of multi-component kinetics, both PN and 4NP exhibited an antagonistic effect on adsorption, requiring more time for the compounds to be removed from the solution (PN - 50 min, 4NP - 60 min). For phenol, the adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir model, and the adsorption was exothermic. On the other hand, the adsorption of 4NP was represented by the Freundlich model, indicating exothermic multilayer adsorption. For the multi-component results, the best fit was the multi-component Freundlich model. The results showed that in both mono- and multi-component systems, 4NP had a higher adsorption capacity and was more competitive for the active site of the adsorbent. Continuous system assays corroborated the data obtained in the batch reactor. The breakthrough curves clearly showed the antagonistic effect of 4NP on the adsorption of PN onto coconut shell activated carbon.
