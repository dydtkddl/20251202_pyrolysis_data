Enhanced dispersion of carbon nanotube in silicone rubber assisted by graphene We report a novel, scalable and inexpensive approach to fully disperse carbon nanotubes in silicone rubber by the addition of graphene. In comparison to graphene, the dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in silicone rubber matrix is extremely difficult although both of them possess similar physical structure. The different dispersion behavior of graphene and MWNTs could be contributed to the difference in their interaction with polymer matrix and their geometry. Based on SEM, TEM and XRD analysis, we find that the dispersion of MWNTs in silicone rubber is dramatically improved by the addition of graphene. Graphene acts as a compatilizer since it shows strong interaction with both polymer matrix and MWNTs. This method provides a simple route to enhance the dispersion of carbon nanotubes and improve the electrical property of the polymer composites. The synergic effect of the hybrid materials may not to be limited to the applications in polymer composites.
