You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on material extrusion (MEX) of polyethylene - Challenges, opportunities, and future prospects Polyethylene (PE) is a widely used thermoplastic valued for its low cost, chemical resistance, recyclability, and good mechanical properties. PE makes up about one-third of the global plastic production. Recent advances in the field of additive manufacturing, especially material extrusion (MEX), have initiated interest in incorporating PE. However, using PE in such applications is challenging due to the polymer's semicrystalline nature, which causes significant shrinkage when cooled and limits chain diffusion, affecting the adhesion between the deposited layers. PE's non-polar character can also reduce the adhesion of the 3D-printed part to the printing bed. This paper analyzes the current progress in using PE in MEX, attempts to correlate PE's thermo-rheological properties with its 3D printability, and discusses the challenges associated with PE within the nozzle, post-deposition on the bed, and in the stand-off region between them. Additionally, the paper highlights the strategies to overcome these challenges to improve PE's printability in MEX by modulating the physicochemical properties of PE via incorporating fillers and nanofillers and blending with other polymers. Finally, future research directions are proposed to aid the design of PE-based feedstocks, which could also enhance plastic recycling.
