You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of polyethylene mixed with poly(vinyl chloride) and poly(ethyleneterephthalate) Thermal degradation of plastics such as polyethylene (PE), poly(vinylchloride) (PVC), poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) and their mixtures (PE + PVC and PE + PET) was studied at 430 °C by batch operation to analyse the conversion of waste plastics into fuel oil. A visual inspection of the inside of the reactor was made and the macroscopic process of degradation was monitored. Products of degradation were classified into three groups: gases, liquids and residues in the reactor. The degradation of PE produced liquid products which consisted of C5-C25 fraction of hydrocarbons with a yield of 70 wt%. On the other hand, the degradation of PVC produced only 4.7 wt% liquid products which consisted of C5-C20 fraction of hydrocarbons and the degradation of PET produced no liquid products. The effect of mixing PVC and PET with PE on the yield and compositions of liquid products was investigated. The addition of either PVC or PET to PE decreased the overall liquid products yield; however, it promoted the degradation of PE into low molecular weight liquid hydrocarbon products.
