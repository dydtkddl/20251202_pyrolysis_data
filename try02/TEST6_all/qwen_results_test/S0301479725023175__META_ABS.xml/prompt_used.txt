You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution of characteristic components from retired wind turbine blades in multiple thermal atmospheres: thermal decomposition characterization and kinetic behavior The lack of adequate data and in-depth insights into the thermal decomposition kinetics of retired wind turbine blades (RFTBs) critically impede its thermal recycling and upgrade. This study explores the non-isothermal pyrolysis of RFTBs under inert N2 atmosphere and reactive air and CO2 atmospheres at heating rates of 10–30 K/min. The PET component (C1) and full RFTBs component (C3) exhibited two pyrolysis stages (Py1 and Py2) in N2, whereas the glass fiber reinforced polymer (C2) revealed only one pyrolysis stage. Higher heating rates shifted peaks of heat weight loss rate upward due to thermal hysteresis. Under air and CO2 atmospheres, all feedstocks developed an additional gasification stage (Gs, >400 °C), originating from products undergoing partial oxidation reactions in air and interactions in CO2. Both pathways release heat that accelerates pyrolysis through localized thermal enhancement, effectively reducing heat transfer limitations via short-distance energy redistribution. Apparent activation energies for C3 obtained via Model-free fitting method were 148.43/181.34 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2, N2), 151.07/151.57/136.62 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2/Gs, air), and 67.76/87.79/78.85 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2/Gs, CO2), demonstrating that autothermal pyrolysis in air and CO2 gasification are more active and energy-saving than traditional pyrolysis in N2. Model-fitting method revealed optimal mechanisms involving random nucleation and nuclei growth (An, n = 4 for Py1, n = 2/3 for Py2 and Gs), accurately describing CO2 gasification of full RFTBs component, and these were validated through kinetic compensation effect analysis. This study provides accurate and critical guidance for the design, optimization and scale-up of RFTBs pyrolysis procedures and reactors.
