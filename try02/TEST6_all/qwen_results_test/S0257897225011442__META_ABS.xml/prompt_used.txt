You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Designing the future of energy storage: Comparative assessment of deposition methods for 3D foam-based next-generation lithium-ion batteries The ever-growing demand for efficient and sustainable energy storage has driven intensive research into advanced lithium-ion battery (LIB) architectures. Among emerging strategies, the use of three-dimensional (3D) foam-type current collectors has shown significant promise in overcoming the limitations of conventional two-dimensional electrode designs. These 3D scaffolds enable high surface area, improved electron/ion transport, and enhanced structural stability under cycling stress. However, achieving uniform and strongly adherent coatings of active materials on such complex geometries requires carefully tailored deposition methods. This review provides a comprehensive and comparative assessment of the most prominent deposition techniques, including hydro/solvothermal synthesis, electrodeposition, in-situ growth via thermal oxidation, and other solution-based or vapor-phase approaches, employed for fabricating high-performance electrodes on 3D foam substrates such as nickel, copper, carbon, and graphene foams. The underlying mechanisms, morphological evolution, and electrochemical performance of each approach are critically discussed. Emphasis is placed on correlating process parameters with coating quality, structural integrity, and battery performance metrics, such as specific capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability. The insights gathered here provide a practical roadmap for advancing next-generation LIB electrodes through rational selection and optimization of deposition strategies tailored to 3D architectures.
