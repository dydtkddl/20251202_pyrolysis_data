You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing aromatics and olefins yields in thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE over zeolites: Role of staged catalysis and acid site density of HZSM-5 The present work deals with the thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE (low-density polyethylene) in lab-scale one- and two-stage test rigs over HZSM-5 catalysts featuring different acid site densities. In the first part of this work, the influence of catalyst-to-feed ratio and temperature (in conjunction with the acid site density of HZSM-5) on the product distribution was studied with an aim to identify the optimum operating conditions for the enhanced production of aromatics and light olefins. For this purpose, one-stage thermo-catalytic pyrolysis was performed in which catalysts were mixed with LDPE pellets for in-situ catalysis. In the one-stage catalytic pyrolysis, the catalyst sample with the highest acid site density gave the highest concentration of aromatics (ca. 55%) in the pyrolysis oil with a mono-aromatics fraction of over 50% that consisted mainly of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) compounds. The highest C2-C4 olefins concentration (ca. 65%) in the pyrolysis gas was obtained when the sample with the lowest acid site density was used. In the two-stage catalytic pyrolysis (ex-situ catalysis), the concentration of aromatics in the pyrolysis oil reached over 77% with a mono-aromatics fraction of ca. 72% that contained mainly BTEX compounds, when the most acidic catalyst was used. When the catalyst with the lowest number of strong acid sites was employed, the high content of C2-C4 olefins in the pyrolysis gas remained almost independent of the reactor configuration. These findings might provide important new insights for the chemical recycling of plastic wastes.
