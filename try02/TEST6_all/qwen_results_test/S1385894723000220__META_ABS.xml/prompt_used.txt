You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of toxic chemicals into flammable gases through the thermolysis of polyurethane foam using CO2 Construction waste is considered an environmental problem because its landfilling/incineration treatment methods has noticeably increased the likelihood of releasing microplastics, leachates, air pollutants, and toxic gases into the environment. Nevertheless, an environmentally benign disposal protocol for building plastic waste has yet to be fully implemented. In this study, a cleaner and safer disposal platform for building plastic waste is suggested. Specifically, the thermo-chemical treatment of building insulator waste (BIW) was conducted using CO2 as a key detoxifying agent. The BIW used in this study was composed of polyurethane foam (PUF), according to instrumental analyses. The thermal degradation of the PUF resulted in the dominant production of hazardous chemicals such as 4,4′-methylenedianiline (MDA) and its derivatives. The toxic compounds were transformed/detoxified into syngas (H2/CO) through the catalytic pyrolysis of PUF over nickel-based catalysts. Using CO2 as a detoxifying agent, MDA and its derivatives were further transformed into CO due to the homogeneous chemical reaction between CO2 and toxic compounds. 78.4 wt% of toxic compounds were converted into syngas over the CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis. Simultaneous reduction of toxic chemicals and production of value-added compounds propose that CO2 has a great potential to be used as a reaction medium to suppress toxic chemical valorization. Thus, this study experimentally confirmed the technical viability of catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 as a promising disposal platform for BIW, effectively suppressing the fate of toxic compounds.
