You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on plastic waste valorisation to advanced materials: Solutions and technologies to curb plastic waste pollution Plastic's low cost, versatile and durable nature has rendered it a popular material in the market. Such inevitable high demand has resulted in overwhelming production on a global scale, leading to the generation of a large quantity of plastic waste (PW). The recycling of PW is challenging due to its low degradability and quality loss after each cycle. Large quantities of PW are dumped into the ocean or end up in landfills annually. Due to long-term environmental exposures, plastic degrades into micro-sized particles, which pose severe threats to human health, marine life, and the environment. To overcome this issue, numerous researchers have made efforts to transform PW into useful resources before their degradation into microplastics, which cause secondary pollution. This paper aims to comprehensively review the transformation of PW into advanced materials, fuels, and chemicals through various valorisation technologies. Valorisation technologies including thermal (combustion, torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, carbonization and one-step hot moulding), biological (microbial and enzymatic degradation) and physical approaches (plastic recycling) that deconstruct plastics into useful chemical intermediates are critically reviewed. The products obtained from the technologies, their resultant properties, and potential applications are highlighted. The detailed studies in these areas could provide insights into sustainable PW management and generate positive economic value. Therefore, further research and development are needed to improve the current technologies to reduce pollution from plastic trash. Collaborative efforts between governments, industries, and research institutes are essential for establishing supportive regulatory frameworks.
