You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in lignin-derived mesoporous carbon based-on template methods Biomass resources are considered one of the most promising renewable materials to replace fossil resources. In an effort to foster sustainable development, many recent research endeavors have centered around the exploration of biomass valorization. The global agricultural land area is about five billion hectares, accounting for 38 % of the world's land area. Each year, nature synthesizes roughly 170 billion tons of biomass via photosynthesis, a substantial part of which is comprised of lignocellulosic agroforestry residues. Lignin, a vital component of lignocellulose, constitutes about 30 % of the organic carbon in the biosphere, ranking as the second most abundant biomass resource on Earth. Therefore, lignin has broad prospects in the field of high-performance mesoporous carbon due to its polyphenolic properties. This review meticulously outlines the principles, advantages, limitations, and the structural framework of template methods utilized in crafting mesoporous carbon from lignin. Moreover, it examines the latest usage of lignin-based mesoporous carbon in various domains such as adsorption, catalysis, drug delivery, thermal and hydrogen storage, along with electrochemical energy storage (encompassing lithium-ion batteries, solar cells, fuel cells, and supercapacitors) and sustainability evaluations. In conclusion, this discourse offers a fresh perspective on the potential developments in the preparation and applications of templated lignin-based mesoporous carbon. Undoubtedly, the strategic design of templated lignin-based mesoporous carbon will propel its widespread application across diverse sectors, thereby fostering a greener and more sustainable society.
