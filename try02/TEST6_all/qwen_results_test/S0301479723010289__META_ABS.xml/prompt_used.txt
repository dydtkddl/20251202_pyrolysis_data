You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics as emergent contaminants in landfill leachate: Source, potential impact and remediation technologies A significant amount of plastic waste is generated each year on a global scale, in which the maximum quantity of plastic waste is typically dumped in landfills in various parts of the world. Moreover, dumping plastic waste in landfills cannot address the issue of proper disposal; it simply delays the process. Exploiting waste resources entails environmental hazards because plastic wastes buried in landfills gradually break down into Microplastics (MPs) due to physical, chemical, and biological effects. The possibility of landfill leachate as a source of MPs in the environment has not received much attention. Without systematic treatment, MPs in leachate increase the risk to human health and environmental health since they contain dangerous and toxic pollutants and antibiotic resistance genes transmitted by leachate vectors. Due to their severe environmental risks, MPs are now widely recognized as emerging pollutants. Therefore, the composition of MPs in landfill leachate and the interaction of MPs with other hazardous contaminants are summarised in this review. The available potential mitigation or treatment methods of MPs in landfill leachate as of now, along with the drawbacks and challenges of the present leachate treatment for eliminating MPs, are described in this review. Since it is unclear how MPs will be removed from the current leachate facilities, it is crucial to develop innovative treatment facilities as quickly as possible. Finally, the areas that require more research to provide complete solutions to the persistent problem of plastic debris are discussed.
