You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study on pyrolysis behaviors and chlorine release of pure PVC polymer and commercial PVC plastics The organic and inorganic additives in PVC plastics cause great difficulties in their actual recycling process, which are different from pure PVC polymer (PVC-PO). In this study, PVC-PO and two commercial PVC plastics were selected and their differences in structure, pyrolysis behavior, chlorine release and migration were compared by FTIR, TG-MS and a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor. There were more oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic compounds in the commercial PVC plastics than PVC-PO because of the addition of foaming agents, flame retardants and lubricants. The thermal weight loss of the commercial PVC plastics was divided into three stages due to the decomposition of additives and the releases of CO2 gas, while that of the PVC-PO was two. The pyrolysis tar of two PVC plastics contained 35.72% and 15.71% oxygenated compounds, respectively, while that obtained from PVC-PO contained 96.46% of aromatic compounds. In addition, calcium additives in PVC plastics could promote the cracking of heavy constituents in the volatile, which was favorable for the formation of more light fractions in tar. The pyrolysis gas of PVC-PO was mainly composed of H2 and C1-C4 hydrocarbon gases, while that of PVC plastics contained about 50% of CO2, followed by H2 and hydrocarbon gases. The chlorine content of the PVC-PO (55.88 wt.%) was higher than that of the PVC plastics (13.83 wt.%, 22.77 wt.%). Most of the chlorine in the three PVC samples released as HCl at 220–370 °C, while the peak temperature of dechlorination of the PVC-PO delayed about 8 °C compared to that of PVC plastics and small part of HCl also released at around 475 °C in the pyrolysis of PVC-PO. About 99.90 wt.% of the chlorine was distributed in the gas phase after PVC-PO pyrolysis, while there were 99.85 wt.% and 97.85 wt.% of chlorine was detected in the gas products of two PVC plastics.
