The Synthesis and Investigation of the Reforming Catalysts for the Reduced Aromatics Content Gasoline Obtaining The paper presents the results of the carrier acidity impact studying on the Pt-Re/Al2O3 catalytic properties in gasoline reforming. The Pt-Re/Al2O3 catalyst preparation based on the superacidity carrier in consequence of the presence of promotor - the bayerite phase of aluminum hydroxide resulted in the H-C7 predominat cracking to C3-C6 light paraffins. The obtained catalyst allows to produce the reduced aromatics content reformed gasoline (55%wt).
