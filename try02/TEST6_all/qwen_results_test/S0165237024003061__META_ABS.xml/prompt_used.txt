You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress and challenges of mesoporous catalysts in upgraded pyrolysis of biomass for biofuel production Driven by the depletion of fossil fuels, there is a pressing need for clean alternative fuels for energy applications. Biomass pyrolysis, utilizing biomass as a feedstock, has emerged as a promising sustainable alternative. However, the presence of oxygen-containing compounds and high acidity in the biofuel produced through pyrolysis necessitate further upgrading. Mesoporous catalysts, with their high surface area, tunable pore size, and catalytic activity, have shown great potential in improving the quality of biofuels derived from biomass pyrolysis. This review explores the recent advancements and challenges associated with employing mesoporous catalysts in the upgraded pyrolysis of biomass for biofuel production. It delves into the various types of mesoporous catalysts utilized and the catalytic mechanisms at play during the upgrading process. The review further discusses the progress made and the challenges encountered in the application of mesoporous catalysts. Strategies to enhance catalyst stability and activity, such as catalyst modification and the use of co-catalysts, are also examined. Additionally, the review emphasizes the critical properties of the mesoporous structure for optimal catalyst design. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the development and application of mesoporous catalysts in pyrolysis for biofuel production. It highlights the promise of mesoporous catalysts while also acknowledging the challenges that need to be addressed for their successful implementation.
