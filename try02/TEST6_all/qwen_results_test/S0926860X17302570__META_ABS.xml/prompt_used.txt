You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective dealumination of HZSM-5 zeolite boosts propylene by modifying 1-butene cracking pathway An HZSM-5 zeolite was dealuminated by steaming with its self-adsorbed water at mild temperatures (300, 400 or 500°C), characterized and tested in the transformation of 1-butene into propylene. The structural, porous-surface and acidic properties of the catalysts (unmodified and steamed) were characterized using N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, tert-butylamine adsorption-TPD, XRD, 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR, and FTIR spectroscopies, and the results pointed to the following evidences: (i) dealumination took place transforming specific strong acid, framework tetrahedral Al sitings (located within the micropores) into distorted and extra-framework species; and (ii) the porous-surface properties were less sensible to the treatment. The acid site density was shifted towards the intersections of the zeolite micropores (of weaker acidity), resulting in the selective inhibition of hydrogen transfer pathway, thus lowering the selectivity of paraffins, aromatics and ultimately, coke deposition. Overall, the performance of the 500°C-steamed catalyst compared with the parent one was enhanced: propylene selectivity was boosted 69%, coke deposition dropped by 34%, whereas the initial conversion only fell 6%.
