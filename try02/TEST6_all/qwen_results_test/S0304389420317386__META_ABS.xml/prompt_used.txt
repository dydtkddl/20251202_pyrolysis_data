You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards, and migration and distribution of bromine Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB) was performed to investigate the characteristics of pyrolysis product and Br fixation. Pyrolysis conversion increased with increasing temperature, reaching 93.3 % at 650 °C. However, increasing heating time did not exhibit remarkable influence on pyrolysis conversion. At 350 °C, phenols were main compounds in the oil accounting for 91.15 %. As the temperature increased to 650 °C, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (except phenols) increased to 20.55 % and 19.03 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the total content of CO2, CO, CH4 and H2 in the non-condensable gases increased significantly. Addition of ZSM-5 and kaolin promoted the recombination reaction of pyrolysis products, increased the relative percentage of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (except phenols) and C11-C20 compounds in the oil, and reduced non-condensable gases. The oxygen bomb-ion chromatography was used to evaluate the Br content of pyrolysis residues. Higher pyrolysis temperature enhanced transfer of Br to pyrolysis gas. K2CO3, Na2CO3 and NaOH reacted with hydrogen bromide to generate KBr and NaBr, which significantly improved the Br fixation efficiency of pyrolysis residues (i.e. from 29.11%–99.80%, 96.39 % and 86.69 %, respectively) and reduced Br content in pyrolysis gas.
