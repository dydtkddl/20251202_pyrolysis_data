You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mapping the recent advancements in bast fiber reinforced biocomposites: A review on fiber modifications, mechanical properties, and their applications Fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs), due to their multifunctional properties, have already occupied a significant place in various applications such as aerospace, automotive, marine, structural engineering, and healthcare industries. Lightweight FRPCs are preferred over heavier materials because of some key advantages, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, design flexibility, fatigue resistance, damping properties, and electrical and thermal insulation properties. Though synthetic fibers such as carbon, glass, aramid fiber reinforced composites are found to provide better performance, these fibers are expensive as well as impose adverse impacts on the environment. Currently, bast fiber reinforced biocomposites (BFBCs) are receiving increasing attention due to their biodegradability, availability, low cost, and higher strength-to-weight ratio. Researchers are working rigorously on BFBCs to unveil their optimal properties. BFBCs can be disposed of easily without affecting the environment. BFBCs, with their sustainable and biodegradable properties, notably promote the use of natural fibers particularly bast fibers and minimize the consumption of expensive and non-degradable synthetic fibers reinforcements in the composite industry. This paper provides an overview of the use of different natural fibers in reinforcing polymer composites for various applications to achieve sustainability. The influence of various fibrous preforms of bast fibers on the mechanical behavior of BFBCs, and their prospects are comprehensively reviewed.
