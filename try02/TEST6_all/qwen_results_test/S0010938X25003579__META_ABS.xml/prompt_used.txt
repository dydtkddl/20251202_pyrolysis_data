You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-temperature long-term oxidation resistance of SiCf/SiC-TaB2 composites fabricated by organic-inorganic hybrid precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process As an ideal material for high-performance aeroengines, silicon carbide ceramic matrix composites (SiC-CMCs) still face challenges such as degradation due to high-temperature oxidation and limitations of traditional processing methods. In this study, the SiCf/SiC-TaB2 composites were fabricated using an organic-inorganic hybrid process combining precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) and slurry infiltration (SI) techniques. Analysis of both non-isothermal and isothermal oxidation behaviors revealed that the incorporation of TaB2 particles substantially improves the oxidation resistance of SiC-CMCs over a wide temperature range. Moreover, a critical finding is the structural evolution of Ta2O5, formed from the oxidation of TaB2, which transitions from grainy to flaky and eventually to a layered structure, significantly contributing to the composites' long-term oxidation resistance. Compared with the conventional SiCf/SiC composites, the mass change of the SiCf/SiC-TaB2 composites decreased by 34.8 %, 52.0 %, and 86.2 % after oxidation at 1200°C, 1300°C, and 1400°C for 100 hours, respectively. Meanwhile, the strength retention of the composites increased by 6.61 %, 13.90 %, and 6.87 % at these temperatures. These findings underscore the efficacy of the organic-inorganic hybrid precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process in producing high-performance SiC-CMCs with enhanced oxidation resistance and mechanical durability.
