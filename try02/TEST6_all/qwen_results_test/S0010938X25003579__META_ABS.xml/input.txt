High-temperature long-term oxidation resistance of SiCf/SiC-TaB2 composites fabricated by organic-inorganic hybrid precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process As an ideal material for high-performance aeroengines, silicon carbide ceramic matrix composites (SiC-CMCs) still face challenges such as degradation due to high-temperature oxidation and limitations of traditional processing methods. In this study, the SiCf/SiC-TaB2 composites were fabricated using an organic-inorganic hybrid process combining precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) and slurry infiltration (SI) techniques. Analysis of both non-isothermal and isothermal oxidation behaviors revealed that the incorporation of TaB2 particles substantially improves the oxidation resistance of SiC-CMCs over a wide temperature range. Moreover, a critical finding is the structural evolution of Ta2O5, formed from the oxidation of TaB2, which transitions from grainy to flaky and eventually to a layered structure, significantly contributing to the composites' long-term oxidation resistance. Compared with the conventional SiCf/SiC composites, the mass change of the SiCf/SiC-TaB2 composites decreased by 34.8 %, 52.0 %, and 86.2 % after oxidation at 1200°C, 1300°C, and 1400°C for 100 hours, respectively. Meanwhile, the strength retention of the composites increased by 6.61 %, 13.90 %, and 6.87 % at these temperatures. These findings underscore the efficacy of the organic-inorganic hybrid precursor infiltration and pyrolysis process in producing high-performance SiC-CMCs with enhanced oxidation resistance and mechanical durability.
