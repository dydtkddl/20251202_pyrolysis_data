You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Different approaches to convert waste polyolefins into automotive fuels via hydrocracking with a NiW/HY catalyst Different approaches to upgrade waste plastic and vacuum gasoil (VGO) blends via hydrocracking have been investigated. The approaches have consisted on using different charges: (i) neat VGO; (ii) neat plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO); (iii) a PPO/VGO blend; (iv) a high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/VGO blend; and (v) a ternary PPO/HDPE/VGO blend. The runs have been conducted in a batch reactor at: 400–440 °C; 80 bar; catalyst to oil mass ratio, 0.1 gcat gcharge −1; and reaction time, 2 h. Obtained products have been grouped in different lumps, which are defined according to their boiling point range: gas, naphtha, light cycle oil (LCO), heavy cycle oil (HCO), wax (unconverted plastic) and coke. The concentration of the families of compounds (n-paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics with 1, 2 and 3+ rings) has been also determined. Results expose that composition of products is improved with respect to that obtained in the hydrocracking of VGO with both binary and ternary blends. The naphtha and LCO obtained in the hydrocracking of PPO/VGO and PPO/HDPE/VGO blends have a lower concentration of aromatics than the lumps of the VGO, making them more attractive to be added to the pools of fuels in refinery.
