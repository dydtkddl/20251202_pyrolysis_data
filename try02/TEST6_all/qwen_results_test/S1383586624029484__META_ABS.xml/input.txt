Optimization of product distribution during co-pyrolysis of furfural residues and waste tyres via response surface method and infrared heating Co-pyrolysis technique has proved to be an available way to recycle the energy of biomass waste and improve bio-oil quality. In this work, the co-pyrolysis behaviors and product distribution of waste tyres (WT) and furfural residues (FR) were studied by TG-FTIR/GC–MS and infrared heating fixed reactor. TG-FTIR/GC–MS results show that a large amount of CH4 and aromatics were produced at the co-pyrolysis temperature of 410°C. The response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to optimize the yields of co-pyrolysis products, including oil, aromatic hydrocarbon (AH) in oil, and CH4 in gas. It was found that the highest oil production of 39.24 wt% was obtained at 550 °C and 10 °C/s, with the highest AH content of 35.02 % and the highest CH4 yield of 17.65 wt% at 700 °C and 40 °C/s. Co-pyrolysis oil and char characteristics were analyzed by SIMDIS, GC–MS, XPS, and the ultimate analysis. It was found that there was a high D-limonene content in oil (up to 25.79 %). With increasing co-pyrolysis temperature, AH content gradually increased and that of acid in oil declined. As the temperature elevated from 400 to 700 °C at 10 °C/s, the content of AH rose from 6.48 to 31.56 % and that of acid decreased from 19.74 to 11.73 %. In addition, the transformation of organic sulfur into metal sulfides was facilitated by raising the temperature.
