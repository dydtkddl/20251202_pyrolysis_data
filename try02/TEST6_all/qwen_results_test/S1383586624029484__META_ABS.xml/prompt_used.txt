You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of product distribution during co-pyrolysis of furfural residues and waste tyres via response surface method and infrared heating Co-pyrolysis technique has proved to be an available way to recycle the energy of biomass waste and improve bio-oil quality. In this work, the co-pyrolysis behaviors and product distribution of waste tyres (WT) and furfural residues (FR) were studied by TG-FTIR/GC–MS and infrared heating fixed reactor. TG-FTIR/GC–MS results show that a large amount of CH4 and aromatics were produced at the co-pyrolysis temperature of 410°C. The response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to optimize the yields of co-pyrolysis products, including oil, aromatic hydrocarbon (AH) in oil, and CH4 in gas. It was found that the highest oil production of 39.24 wt% was obtained at 550 °C and 10 °C/s, with the highest AH content of 35.02 % and the highest CH4 yield of 17.65 wt% at 700 °C and 40 °C/s. Co-pyrolysis oil and char characteristics were analyzed by SIMDIS, GC–MS, XPS, and the ultimate analysis. It was found that there was a high D-limonene content in oil (up to 25.79 %). With increasing co-pyrolysis temperature, AH content gradually increased and that of acid in oil declined. As the temperature elevated from 400 to 700 °C at 10 °C/s, the content of AH rose from 6.48 to 31.56 % and that of acid decreased from 19.74 to 11.73 %. In addition, the transformation of organic sulfur into metal sulfides was facilitated by raising the temperature.
