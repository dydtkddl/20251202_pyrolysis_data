You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zeolite Y hydrolyses methyl methacrylate to methacrylic acid in the gas phase Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) depolymerizes to its monomer methyl methacrylate (MMA) below 400 °C but the accompanying byproducts have similar boiling points, which incurs excessive separation costs rendering the process economically challenging. Hydrolyzing MMA to methacrylic acid (MAA) is an economic alternative since its boiling point is 61 °C higher. Zeolites are among a class of heterogeneous catalyst with Brønsted acidity that protonate the ester carbonyl group in the much less common gas-phase route to acids. Here, for the first time, we report the hydrolysis kinetics of MMA to MAA in the gas phase over a Y/SiO2 zeolite with a 960 m2 g − 1 surface area. MMA conversion in an 8 mm fixed bed reactor averaged 94 % above 200 °C and a yield of 85 %. Operating the reactor in excess water vapour shifts the equilibrium conversion towards the products. Surface reaction between adsorbed MMA and water is the rate controlling step. Heterogeneous supports control the hydrophobic properties, and thereby activity and stability. Introducing zeolites in the matrix of a silica gel facilitates access to all external zeolite active sites compared to spray-drying with Ludox where the SiO2 shell covers the external catalyst surface. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with magic angle spinning (MAS NMR) and ultra-violet visible (UV–vis) detected Brønsted acidity. The reaction rate is first order in methacrylic acid and water and the equilibrium conversion is about 95 % above 200 °C. The apparent activation energy was 106 kJ mol−1.
