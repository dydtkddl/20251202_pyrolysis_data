4D biofabrication of functionally gradient hydrogels: A pathway to morphogenetic tissue engineering The integration of four-dimensional (4D) biofabrication with functionally gradient hydrogels (FGHs) presents a transformative strategy for morphogenetic tissue engineering by mimicking the spatiotemporal dynamics of native tissue development through programmed shape transformations. This rapidly evolving field has been propelled by recent advances in material design, fabrication technologies, and the incorporation of stimuli-responsive functionalities. This review summarizes gradient engineering technologies for modulating chemical, mechanical, and structural gradients within hydrogel matrices, and examines the mechanisms and performance of these gradients in guiding anisotropic tissue architecture formation and promoting functional integration under physiological conditions. Representative applications in cartilage, bone, vascular, and neural tissue engineering are highlighted to illustrate the potential of 4D biofabricated FGHs (4D bioFGHs) in directing tissue morphogenesis and promoting functional regeneration. Despite substantial progress, key challenges persist in developing suitable biomaterials, achieving gradient fidelity, quantifying dynamic deformations, and advancing clinical translation. Addressing these limitations through interdisciplinary innovation will be essential for realizing the therapeutic potential of 4D bioFGHs.
