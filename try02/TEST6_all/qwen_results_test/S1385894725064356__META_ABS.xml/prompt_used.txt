You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

How bubbles formation and growth affect plastic pyrolysis process: A phenomenological investigation through dimensionless numbers Polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis is an essential process for converting plastic waste into valuable products, but the interplay between chemical kinetics and physical phenomena, such as bubble formation, heat transfer, and devolatilization, remains a challenge for reactor-scale design. While the influence of transport limitations under fast heating is recognized, their quantitative integration into predictive models is still lacking. This study investigates PE pyrolysis using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Pyroprobe experiments over a wide range of heating rates (5 °C/min to 20,000 °C/s). TGA results show that heat transfer resistance delays degradation onset, with apparent activation energies ranging from 338 to 385 kJ/mol (non-isothermal) and 65–155 kJ/mol (isothermal). Pyroprobe data reveal diffusion-controlled behavior, bubble entrapment, and incomplete devolatilization. To evaluate the timing between melting and pyrolysis, we introduce the dimensionless “H number,” which compares melting time to reaction time and identifies whether pyrolysis begins before the polymer is fully molten. Together with the Biot and internal pyrolysis numbers, it helps distinguish kinetic from transport-limited regimes and predict the onset of physical constraints. Our findings show that only sub-milligram samples reach true kinetic control. This integrated approach offers a practical framework to assess heat and mass transfer effects, supporting the design of more efficient and selective pyrolysis reactors for industrial plastic waste valorization.
