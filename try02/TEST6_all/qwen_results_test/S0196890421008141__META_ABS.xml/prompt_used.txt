You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress in pyrolysis conversion of waste into value-added liquid pyro-oil, with focus on heating source and machine learning analysis This work emphases the influence of using different heating sources (direct thermal, solar, infrared, microwave heating) on the pyro-oil yield. The effect of the dominating process parameters, namely the heating rate and final temperature, are thoroughly discussed with respect to the heating and reaction mechanism involved. Emphasis is then placed on reviewing the application of microwave (MW) heating in pyrolysis as a relatively new technology with many promising features, particularly the little-known mechanisms of MW heating, new MW heating pattern and pathway using MW absorbents for pyrolysis of waste materials. Machine learning (ML) techniques were then used to statistically analyze the 182 observations in 59 pyrolysis cases obtained from previous pyrolysis practices. The ML linear regression model was developed to predict oil yield by five input variables (feedstock type, feedstock size, heating rate, final temperature, and heating source), which can be used as a guideline for pyrolysis production management. By comparing three heating sources (direct, solar and MW), MW heating is found to be the most efficient method to achieve the highest oil yield. The Decision Tree Analysis demonstrates that the importance order for key variables is as: Log feedstock size > Log heating rate > Heating rate > Temperature > Feedstock size > Heating sources > Feedstock type. Future work should focus on optimizing the heating method and heating rate to achieve optimal yield and quality of pyro-oil. The findings are envisaged to be useful for scaling up the pyrolysis of waste materials for industrial energy applications.
