Recent applications of magnetic composites as extraction adsorbents for determination of environmental pollutants Magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) is considered to be an advancing sample preparation technique for the separation and preconcentration of environmental pollutants at trace-levels. Magnetic composites, as MSPE adsorbents, incorporate the distinct advantages of versatile nanomaterials and magnetic nanoparticles, compared to traditional solid-phase extraction packing materials. The former can afford fast dispersion and efficient recycling when applied in complex sample matrices. In this review, we elaborate the applications of magnetic composites as MSPE adsorbents for the enrichment of environmental pollutants, reported in the last five years.
