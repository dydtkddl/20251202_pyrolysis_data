You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

W-doped niobate-based perovskites: Synthesis by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and structural characterization Nanostructured hollow spheres composed of K0·5Na0.5(WxNb1-x)O3 were synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Correlations between the W-doping content and properties of the [NbO6] octahedra, including morphology, texture, crystalline structure, and polarization were found. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis indicate the present samples are nanostructured hollow spheres. Textural analysis indicates the samples are composed of a balanced framework including micropores (40–50%) and mesopores (50–60%). Structural refinement by the Rietveld method indicated that non-isovalent W6+ cation only occupies the Nb5+ site in the host structure. Several space groups including Amm2, Pbcm, and Pm were used to refine the W-doped K0·5Na0·5NbO3 structure and the best adjustment was reached assuming the co-existence of two distinct symmetries. The FTIR bands associated with a corner-shared NbO6 octahedron suggested an increase in Nb–O bond length in agreement with the Rietveld refinement. In general, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis is an effective methodology for the one-step synthesis of nanostructured crystallites of W-doped niobate-based perovskites with a tailored structure and morphology.
