You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of camelina oil for hydrocarbon biofuel over ZSM-5-Zn catalyst Cracking of camelina oil over non-catalyst and ZSM-5 catalyst doped with different Zn concentrations (0, 10, 20 and 30wt.%) in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated. The fresh and used catalysts were characterized using XRD, FT-IR, BET and TEM. Characterizations of the produced hydrocarbon biofuel, distillation residual and non-condensable gas were carried out. The effect of non-catalyst and catalyst on the physicochemical properties and yield of products was discussed. The results showed that the introduction of Zn did not change the zeolite crystalline structure and ZnO might deposit on the external surface and/or inside the pores of the support ZSM-5. After upgrading, hydrocarbon biofuel had a lower viscosity, lower density, higher heating value (HHV) and higher water content than raw camelina oil. The optimum Zn concentration to ZSM-5 was 20wt.%, at which the highest hydrocarbon biofuel yield and comprehensively the best quality were obtained. Compared to non-catalytic cracking of camelina oil, the loading of Zn to ZSM-5 could improve some physicochemical properties of the hydrocarbon biofuel. In addition, the loading of Zn to ZSM-5 could facilitate the chemical reactions such as decarbonylation and dehydrogenation.
