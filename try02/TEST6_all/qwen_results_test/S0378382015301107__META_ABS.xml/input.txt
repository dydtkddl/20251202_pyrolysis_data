Catalytic cracking of camelina oil for hydrocarbon biofuel over ZSM-5-Zn catalyst Cracking of camelina oil over non-catalyst and ZSM-5 catalyst doped with different Zn concentrations (0, 10, 20 and 30wt.%) in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated. The fresh and used catalysts were characterized using XRD, FT-IR, BET and TEM. Characterizations of the produced hydrocarbon biofuel, distillation residual and non-condensable gas were carried out. The effect of non-catalyst and catalyst on the physicochemical properties and yield of products was discussed. The results showed that the introduction of Zn did not change the zeolite crystalline structure and ZnO might deposit on the external surface and/or inside the pores of the support ZSM-5. After upgrading, hydrocarbon biofuel had a lower viscosity, lower density, higher heating value (HHV) and higher water content than raw camelina oil. The optimum Zn concentration to ZSM-5 was 20wt.%, at which the highest hydrocarbon biofuel yield and comprehensively the best quality were obtained. Compared to non-catalytic cracking of camelina oil, the loading of Zn to ZSM-5 could improve some physicochemical properties of the hydrocarbon biofuel. In addition, the loading of Zn to ZSM-5 could facilitate the chemical reactions such as decarbonylation and dehydrogenation.
