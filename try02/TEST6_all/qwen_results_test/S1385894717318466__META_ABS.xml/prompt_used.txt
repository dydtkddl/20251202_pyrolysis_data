You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and modeling investigations of ball-milled biochar for the removal of aqueous methylene blue Novel adsorbents were produced through the grinding of biochars of different feedstock and pyrolysis temperature in a planetary ball mill. The removal effectiveness and mechanisms of aqueous methylene blue by these adsorbents were examined. Ball milled sugarcane bagasse biomass pyrolyzed at 450 °C (BMBG450) had the highest methylene blue sorption capacity thus was chosen for further study. Compared to unmilled bagasse biochar (BG450), BMBG450 had greater specific surface area, larger pore volume, smaller hydrodynamic radius, stronger negative zeta potential (about 1.6-fold increase), and more oxygen-containing functional groups (1.05 mmol/g increase). These characteristics resulted in much greater methylene blue removal capacity (354 mg/g Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity vs. 17.2 mg/g of original BG450). The increased in BM–biochar’s external and internal surface areas exposed its graphitic structure and oxygen-containing functional groups, thus enhancing methylene blue adsorption via π–π interaction and electrostatic attraction. Experimental and modeling results suggest external mass transfer as the rate-limiting adsorption step for BG450 and surface diffusion as the rate-limiting adsorption step for BMBG450. BM–biochars had a lower equilibrium dosage and shorter reactor detention time when applied in a completely mixed flow reactor (CMFR).
