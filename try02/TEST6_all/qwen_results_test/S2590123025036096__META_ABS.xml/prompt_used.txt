You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biofuel production from food waste and rice straw via microwave co-pyrolysis: Product characterization and optimization using Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology The accelerating negative impacts of climate change driven by overreliance on fossil fuel use and food waste accumulation in landfills underscore the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions. This study presents the first systematic optimization of microwave co-pyrolysis of food waste and rice straw using combined ZnCl2 and biochar additive to simultaneously maximize hydrogen-rich syngas yield and fuel-quality biochar. Unlike prior works relying on trial-and-error or single-factor variation, this study employed response surface methodology based on Box -Behnken Design to evaluate and optimize the combined effects of three key process variables, viz., mixing ratio (75:25–25:75), microwave power (1300–1700 W), and additive quantity (10–20 g), on both gas composition and biochar quality. This multi-factor statistical approach enabled precise identification of synergistic interactions and minimized the need for extensive experimental runs. Under optimal conditions (49 % food waste, 1460 W, and 19 g additive), hydrogen yield reached 27.83±1.2 vol∙% (predicted: 27.24±0.6 vol∙%), and fixed carbon in biochar reached 71.87±2 wt∙% (predicted: 72.38±0.4 wt∙%). Maximum yield conditions (50 % food waste, 1500 W, 15 g additive) achieved 26.93 vol∙% hydrogen and 72 wt∙% fixed carbon, while the minimum yield conditions (75 % food waste, 1700 W, 15 g additive) produced only 13.21 vol∙% hydrogen and 56 wt∙% fixed carbon. A quadratic polynomial model showed excellent predictive capability, highlighting strong synergistic interactions. Beyond statistical optimization, integrating response surface methodology with microwave-assisted catalysis can significantly improve energy efficiency and product quality in biomass co-pyrolysis, providing a replicable pathway for valorizing diverse organic wastes.
