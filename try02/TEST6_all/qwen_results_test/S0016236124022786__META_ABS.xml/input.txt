Design and catalytic performance of Ni catalyst for CO2 methanation based on DIW-3D printing Direct ink writing (DIW/Robocasting), a form of 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing(AM), providing a convenient way to build 3D structures layer-by-layer, which extrudes ink through a nozzle.The three-dimensional catalyst structure of wooden pile was printed by ink direct writing technology and applied to the fixed bed, which effectively reduced the pressure drop and reaction temperature of the reactor, and improved the conversion rate of the reaction target and catalytic efficiency. In this work, CO2 methanation was studied on monolithic structures fabricated by robocasting technique by extruding PDMS loaded nickel catalyst. After characterization, the catalytic performance of monolithic catalysts were evaluated in the reactor in CO2 methanation reaction at temperatures between 250 and 400 °C. In particular, the CO2 conversion rate of 20 %Ni/SiOC monolithic catalyst reached 96.48 % at 300℃. The catalytic performance remained high after 240 h test, and the selectivity of CH4 in all catalytic evaluations was 100 %.
