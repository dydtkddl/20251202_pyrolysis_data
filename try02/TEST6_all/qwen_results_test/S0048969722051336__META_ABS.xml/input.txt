Co-hydrothermal carbonization of organic solid wastes to hydrochar as potential fuel: A review The organic solid waste (OSW) is a potential resource that loses its original value in people's daily production process. It can be used for secondary energy utilization through hydrothermal technology, which is similar to artificially simulating the natural coalification process. Co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) is a promising thermochemical conversion pathway, and advanced mechanisms can eliminate the drawbacks of single-feedstock hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). The preparation and production process of hydrochar can solve the problems of energy crisis and environmental pollution. This paper comprehensively reviews the key mechanisms of co-HTC to prepare solid fuels, and reviews the development process and practical application of hydrothermal technology. To begin with, the physical and chemical properties and combustion performance of co-hydrochar depend on the production method, process parameters, and selection of raw materials. The co-hydrochar usually has a higher HHV and a low atomic ratio of H/C and O/C, which improves combustion performance. Subsequently, the transformation path of the hydrothermal process of lignocellulosic and protein OSW was comprehensively expounded, and the reaction mechanism of the co-HTC of the two OSWs was effectively proposed. The effect of the ratio of different raw materials on the synergistic effect of co-HTC was also analyzed. Furthermore, the typical advantages and disadvantages of environmental safety, technical economy, and practical application in the co-HTC process are expounded. All in all, this review provides some foundations and new directions for the co-HTC of OSWs to prepare potential fuel. In addition, several prospects for the development and integrated application of co-HTC are presented in the future.
