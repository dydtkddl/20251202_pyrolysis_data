Recent advances on industrial solid waste catalysts for improving the quality of bio-oil from biomass catalytic cracking: A review In this review, the research progress on the effect of industrial solid waste as catalyst on the quality of bio-oil in the process of biomass pyrolysis. Industrial solid waste contains metals, such as Fe, Al, and K, and has a suitable porous structure and a high specific surface area. The catalysts or catalyst carriers prepared using industrial solid waste as a raw material have appropriate catalytic effects on biomass pyrolysis. For example, industrial solid waste catalysts or catalyst carriers can increase the yield of bio-oil, effectively improve the quality of bio-oil by increasing its calorific value and reducing its O content, acidity, and viscosity, and improve the feasibility of bio-oil as a liquid fuel. Catalytic pyrolysis can increase the contents of phenols, aromatics, and olefins in the bio-oil and facilitate the application of this oil in the chemical industry. Herein, the progress in the synthesis of high-quality bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis catalyzed by industrial solid waste was reviewed from the aspects of biomass pyrolysis mechanism and reaction pathway, catalytic pyrolysis conversion mechanism, and product regulation mechanism. Moreover, the pyrolysis characteristics, product composition, and conversion mechanism of biomass during catalytic pyrolysis were elucidated, and the future development direction was prospected to provide a basis and reference for the efficient conversion and utilization of biomass. The results of this review show that industrial solid waste is used as a catalyst in the process of biomass pyrolysis, which can effectively improve the quality of bio-oil. This method is a simple and efficient way of resource utilization of industrial solid waste. It can realize effective industrial solid waste management and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, so as to ensure national energy security.
