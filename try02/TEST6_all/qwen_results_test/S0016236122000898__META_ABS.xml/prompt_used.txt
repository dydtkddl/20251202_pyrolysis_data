You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances on industrial solid waste catalysts for improving the quality of bio-oil from biomass catalytic cracking: A review In this review, the research progress on the effect of industrial solid waste as catalyst on the quality of bio-oil in the process of biomass pyrolysis. Industrial solid waste contains metals, such as Fe, Al, and K, and has a suitable porous structure and a high specific surface area. The catalysts or catalyst carriers prepared using industrial solid waste as a raw material have appropriate catalytic effects on biomass pyrolysis. For example, industrial solid waste catalysts or catalyst carriers can increase the yield of bio-oil, effectively improve the quality of bio-oil by increasing its calorific value and reducing its O content, acidity, and viscosity, and improve the feasibility of bio-oil as a liquid fuel. Catalytic pyrolysis can increase the contents of phenols, aromatics, and olefins in the bio-oil and facilitate the application of this oil in the chemical industry. Herein, the progress in the synthesis of high-quality bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis catalyzed by industrial solid waste was reviewed from the aspects of biomass pyrolysis mechanism and reaction pathway, catalytic pyrolysis conversion mechanism, and product regulation mechanism. Moreover, the pyrolysis characteristics, product composition, and conversion mechanism of biomass during catalytic pyrolysis were elucidated, and the future development direction was prospected to provide a basis and reference for the efficient conversion and utilization of biomass. The results of this review show that industrial solid waste is used as a catalyst in the process of biomass pyrolysis, which can effectively improve the quality of bio-oil. This method is a simple and efficient way of resource utilization of industrial solid waste. It can realize effective industrial solid waste management and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, so as to ensure national energy security.
