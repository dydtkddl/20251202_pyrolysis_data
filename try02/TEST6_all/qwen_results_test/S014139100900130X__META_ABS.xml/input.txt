Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane as flame retardant for thermoplastic polyurethane In this work, the reaction to fire of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) containing polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (or POSSs) was investigated by mass loss calorimetry. This composite exhibits a large reduction of peak of heat release rate (PHRR) compared to virgin TPU. The protection occurs via an intumescent mechanism. Mechanism of protection is examined in chemical and physical ways. Solid state NMR of carbon and silicon on heat-treated materials reveals that there is no significant chemical interaction between TPU and POSS. Nevertheless the intumescent char is characterized as ceramified char made of silicon network in a polyaromatic structure. The expansion occurs because of the partial volatilization of the organic part of POSS and because of the evolving degrading products of TPU. The formation of this intumescent structure makes an efficient insulating material at the surface of the substrate limiting heat and mass transfer and then decreasing heat release rate.
