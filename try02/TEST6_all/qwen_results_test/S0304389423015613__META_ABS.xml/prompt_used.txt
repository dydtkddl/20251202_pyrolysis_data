You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Uncovering the centrality of mono-dentate SO3 2-/SO4 2- modifiers grafted on a metal vanadate in accelerating wet NOX reduction and poison pyrolysis NOX rarely binds with labile oxygens of catalytic solids, whose Lewis acidic (LA) species possess higher binding strengths with NH3 (ENH3) and H2O than Brönsted acidic counterparts (BA--H+; -OH), oftentimes leading to elevate energy barrier (EBARRIER) and weaken H2O tolerance, respectively. These limit NH3-assisted wet NOX reduction via Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type or Eley-Rideal (ER)-type model on LA species, while leaving ER-type analogue on BA--H+ species proper to reduce wet NOX. Given hard-to-regulate strength/amount of -OH species and occasional association between ENH3 and EBARRIER, Ni1V2O6 (Ni1) was rationally chosen as a platform to isolate mono-dentate SO3 2-/SO4 2- species for use as BA--H+ bonds via protonation to increase collision frequency (k’APP,0) alongside with disclosure of advantages of SO3 2-/SO4 2--functionalized Ni1V2O6 (Ni1-S) over Ni1 in reducing wet NOX. Ni1-S outperformed Ni1 in achieving a larger BA--H+ quantity (k’APP,0↑), increasing H2O tolerance, and elevating oxygen mobility, thus promoting NOX reduction activity/consequences under SO2-excluding gases. V2O5-WO3 composite simulating a commercial catalyst could isolate mono-dentate SO3 2-/SO4 2- species and served as a control (V2O5-WO3-S) for comparison. Ni1-S was superior to V2O5-WO3-S in evading ammonium (bi-)sulfate (AS/ABS) poison accumulation and expediting AS/ABS pyrolysis efficiency, thereby improving AS/ABS resistance under SO2-including gases, while enhancing resistance against hydro-thermal aging.
