You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biodegradation of modified Poly(lactic acid) based biocomposite films under thermophilic composting conditions This study evaluates the aerobic biodegradation of modified Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based biocomposites under composting condition. Samples of neat PLA (NPLA), PLA/chitosan 5% (modified) (PLA/Chitosan), PLA/CNCSO4 (̴1%) (PLA/CNC) and PLA/Gum Arabic 5% (modified) (PLA/Gum) were used for evaluation of biodegradation under simulated composting condition without adding any inoculum to the compost and utilizing the thermophilic microflora already present in the compost. Various analytical techniques like molecular weight analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), contact angle analysis and microbial colony count were used for analysis of biodegradation. Colony formation was analyzed and was found to be 5.12 × 106 cfu/ml in PLA/Chitosan sample. Contact angle measurement was employed for understanding biodegradation over a period of 70 days for the biocomposites. Biodegradation study was also confirmed through decrease in transparency and major peak shift in infra-red (IR) spectroscopy. DSC studies showed increase in crystallinity for all the degraded test samples, which confirms biodegradation. The results confirmed modified PLA films as biodegradable and also confirmed suitability of the test system for studying biopolymer biodegradation.
