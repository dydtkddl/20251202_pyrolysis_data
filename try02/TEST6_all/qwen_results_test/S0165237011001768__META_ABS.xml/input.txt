Post spinning and pyrolysis processes of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fiber and activated carbon fiber: A review This paper reviews pyrolysis process to convert PAN precursor fiber into PAN-based carbon fiber and activated carbon fiber. The parameters involved during heat treatment of PAN fiber are consistently discussed. Post spinning treatments of PAN fiber are also discussed in this paper as it has a crucial contribution towards the success of pyrolysis processes. Finally, the recent development and future works in research and development are briefly discussed to further extend the boundary of science and technology of PAN-based carbon fiber and activated carbon fiber in order to fully explore its potential.
