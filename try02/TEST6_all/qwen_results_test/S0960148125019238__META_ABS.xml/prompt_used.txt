You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of thermochemical pathways for sustainable production of high-value chemicals from agroforestry wastes and plastics biorefineries This study aims to explore cost-effective upgrading strategies for biomass and waste plastics to achieve low-carbon sustainable development, serving as an alternative to traditional petroleum-based production routes for fuels and chemicals. An assessment of products recovered from major agroforestry wastes and disposable plastic packaging bags in the region is conducted through multiple thermochemical pathways. Specifically, the catalytic co-pyrolysis process enables synergistic and efficient conversion of biomass and plastics, yielding high-economic-value derivatives suitable for refining in existing petroleum infrastructure. The core of this work is the synthesis of inexpensive kieselguhr-based beta (KB) zeolites via an in situ depolymerization-recrystallization mechanism, where the dual active sites in metal-zeolite composites exhibit not only strong capture capacity for oxygenated compounds but also promote hydrogen transfer reactions for synergistic deoxidation-aromatization of products. During catalytic co-pyrolysis, KB zeolite effectively refines bio-oils, yielding carbon fractions ranging from C6 to C14, minimal oxygenated fractions, and a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) selectivity of up to 74.9 %. Even at a 2:1 biomass-to-plastic ratio, KB zeolite maintains long-term stable catalytic performance, with MAHs selectivity stabilized at 53.6 %.
