You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of reaction pressure on co-pyrolysis of LDPE and a heavy petroleum fraction Pyrolysis of waste plastics to recycle valuable hydrocarbons represents an attractive technology for reducing waste and providing feedstocks for petrochemical products and fuels. Via the simultaneous processing of heavy petroleum residue fractions, synergies can be harnessed by converting bottom-of-the-barrel refining products into lighter fractions with higher value while improving processability of plastic waste materials. To investigate the effect of reactor pressure, a continuous laboratory co-pyrolysis plant was operated. The setup consisted of two consecutive tubular zones to convert a mixture of LDPE and a heavy petroleum residue to a final temperature of 450 °C at different pressures between 2 and 10 bar. The products were evaluated regarding obtained mass yields and their boiling range. Gaseous and liquid products increased with enhanced pressure, resulting in nearly tripled gas and light liquid formation, whereas more unconverted feed was consumed. Because the reactor pressure also affects the residence time by suppressing evaporation, which subsequently varies between 360 and 440 s, further investigations considering the dependence of product yields on the residence time over a range of 280 to 480 s were necessary. The comparison resulted in the conclusion that the enhancing effect of increased reactor pressure is not only caused by a retention time elongation in the hot reactor zone. Other physical effects also play a role, such as promoted heat transmission and a direct intervention of reactor pressure with the chemical reactions. In the tested range, an enhancing effect of higher reactor pressures on the cracking of the reaction mixture was observed. These novel experimental results indicate, that conversion toward lighter cracking products can be increased by pressure adjustments and highlights that the pressure should be included in process optimizations.
