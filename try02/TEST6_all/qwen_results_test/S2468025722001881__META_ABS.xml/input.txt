Porous framework materials for energy & environment relevant applications: A systematic review Carbon peaking and carbon neutralization trigger a technical revolution in energy & environment related fields. Development of new technologies for green energy production and storage, industrial energy saving and efficiency reinforcement, carbon capture, and pollutant gas treatment is in highly imperious demand. The emerging porous framework materials such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), owing to the permanent porosity, tremendous specific surface area, designable structure and customizable functionality, have shown great potential in major energy-consuming industrial processes, including sustainable energy gas catalytic conversion, energy-efficient industrial gas separation and storage. Herein, this manuscript presents a systematic review of porous framework materials for global and comprehensive energy & environment related applications, from a macroscopic and application perspective.
