You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integration of hydrothermal pretreatment and anaerobic co-digestion strategies to improve the biomethane yield from rice straw and waste algal biomass The lignocellulosic complexity and high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of rice straw (RS) hinder its anaerobic digestion (AD). This study explored integrating hydrothermal pretreatment and anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) to address these challenges and enhance biogas and biomethane production. Hydrothermal pretreatment (200 °C, 20 % total solids, 10 min) was applied to RS to disrupt its structure. AcoD of untreated and pretreated RS (RS200) with algal biomass (AB) at C/N ratios of 20–35 was then conducted to correct nutrient imbalance and regulate microbial activity. AcoD of untreated RS with AB improved biogas and biomethane yields by 23.82–89.01 % and 32.29–74.79 %, respectively. RS200 co-digested with AB at a C/N ratio of 30 achieved the highest biogas and biomethane yields of 686 ± 32 mL/g VSinput and 315 ± 16 mL/g VSinput, showing increases of 151.28 % and 164.71 %. These gains were supported by improved biodegradability, synergistic effects, and volatile solids reduction. Metagenomic analysis revealed a higher abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidota, Chloroflexi) and acetoclastic methanogens (notably Methanothrix) in the AcoD reactor. Thus, integrating hydrothermal pretreatment with co-digestion significantly enhances RS and AB valorization, supporting sustainable waste management and renewable energy production.
