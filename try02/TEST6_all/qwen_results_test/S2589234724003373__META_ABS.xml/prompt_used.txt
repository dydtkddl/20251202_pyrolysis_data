You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards circularity of plastics: A materials informatics perspective Plastic pollution and the associated adversities have been intensively researched recently, providing ample solutions with diverse possibilities and yielding a considerable corpus of literature in plastic waste management (PWM). Regardless of the vast range of techniques formulated, such as mechanical recycling and chemical depolymerization, many of these approaches have limitations including significant costs, ecological threats, and inefficiencies in handling diverse plastic types. Manual analysis of these challenges and the reported solutions from the vast collection of interdisciplinary research papers is extremely laborious. Herein, using tools of data science to create a network of ∼350,000 papers and subsequent clustering to identify various protocols for PWM and determining the main paths of their knowledge evolution, we review their progress. The broad objective of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of different PWM techniques, with a focus on the importance of integrated, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious approaches to solve plastic pollution. We identify four major categories of PWM (physical, chemical, physio-chemical, and biological) and analyze their mechanistic details. Our study highlights the critical need for the establishment of more sustainable PWM methodologies, supporting the integration of artificial intelligence to refine process optimization and cultivate interdisciplinary collaboration focused on advancing a circular economy and reducing plastic waste. Together with a deep discussion on the gaps between the set goals and the current achievements identified, these analyses could be a useful tool to confront the PW crisis.
