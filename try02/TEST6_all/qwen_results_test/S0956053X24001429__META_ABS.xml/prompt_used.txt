You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green separation and decomposition of crystalline silicon photovoltaic module’s backsheet by using ethanol The treatment and recycling of discarded crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules (c-Si PV modules) has become a research focus, but few research have paid attention to the standardized treatment of c-Si PV module’s fluorinated backsheet. Improper management of fluorinated backsheet can pose ecological and human health risks. Therefore, this study presents a novel method for processing the backsheet. The proposed approach entailed the utilization of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) to separate the backsheet from the PV module. Subsequently, the separated backsheet underwent decomposition using an alkaline ethanol (NaOH-CH3CH2OH) solution. Finally, the backsheet was recovered in the form of terephthalic acid (TPA) with a purity of 97.47 %. This recovered TPA can then serve as a valuable raw material for producing new backsheets, fostering a closed-loop material circulation. Experimental results demonstrate that immersing the PV module in a 75 % CH3CH2OH-H2O solution at a temperature of 343 K for 30 min achieved 100 % separation of the backsheet. Furthermore, subjecting the separated backsheet to a 60 min reaction in an NaOH-CH3CH2OH solution with a temperature of 343 K and a NaOH concentration of 1.0 mol/L achieved complete decomposition. The reaction mechanism was analyzed through characterization methods such as SEM/EDS, NMR, FTIR and XRD. This method is efficient, non-toxic organic reagent-free and environmentally friendly, so it holds significant potential for further development in the field of c-Si PV module recycling.
