RETRACTED: Effect of temperature on yield and properties of the sub-fractions derived from pyrolysis of Calophyllum inophyllum deoiled cake This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. It has come to the attention of the Editor-in-Chief that the article is a duplicate of a paper that has already been published in the Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis. “Influence of temperature on yield, composition and properties of the sub-fractions derived from slow pyrolysis of Calophyllum inophyllum de-oiled cake” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165237017304308 One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that their work is original and has not appeared in a publication elsewhere. Re-use of any data should be appropriately cited. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter.
