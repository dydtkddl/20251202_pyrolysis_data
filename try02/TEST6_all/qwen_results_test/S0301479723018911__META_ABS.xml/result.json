  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on recycling carbon fibers from CFRP using pyrolysis, but the primary feedstock is a composite material (CFRP) rather than waste plastic or polymer, and the main experimental data and analysis center on oxidation behavior and DFT calculations, not plastic pyrolysis product yields or characterization."
