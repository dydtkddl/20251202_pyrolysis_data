You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar and pyrolysis liquid production from durian peel by using slow pyrolysis process: Regression analysis, characterization, and economic assessment This study examines the conversion of durian peel to biochar and pyrolysis liquid via slow pyrolysis. The central composite design was utilized to optimize the conditions of three independent variables, namely pyrolysis temperature, cooling temperature, and holding time. Analysis of variance revealed that only pyrolysis temperature had a significant effect on biochar and pyrolysis liquid yields. The biochar and pyrolysis liquid yields fit by a second-order polynomial model agreed well with experimental results. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the solid product yield decreased, while the pyrolysis liquid yield increased. The highest biochar and pyrolysis liquid yields were 56.11% and 38.53% that derive at 300 and 600 °C of pyrolysis temperature, respectively. The validation of both prediction models showed over 96% agreement. Biochar of high heating value (26.55 MJ/kg) was obtained at 600 °C pyrolysis temperature and 30 min holding time. According to the Van Krevelen plot, the molar ratios of the H/C and O/C of the biochar obtained at 600 °C of pyrolysis temperatures were similar to coal material. The high-quality biochar was of carbon storage class 4 according to the IBI classification; and the characteristics of pyrolysis liquid met community product standards of Thailand. An economic analysis was performed to assess the feasibility of converting 60 tons/year of durian peel into biochar and pyrolysis liquid. An internal project rate of return (IRR) of 25.91% with a payback period of 1.58 years was estimated. The findings of this study indicate the economic viability of immediately deploying large-scale pyrolysis utilizing a waste stream from agriculture.
