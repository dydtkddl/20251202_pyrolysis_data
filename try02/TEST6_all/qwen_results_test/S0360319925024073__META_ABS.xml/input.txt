A comprehensive review of zeolite synthesis for partial oxidation of methane to hydrogen-rich syngas production Partial Oxidation of Methane (POM) is a feasible process for producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates that have drawn significant attention in the field of POM due to their physicochemical properties, including microporous channels, high surface area, acidity, and ion-exchanging capabilities. With these beneficial properties, methane and oxygen can be easily accessible to the active sites while avoiding side reactions, enhancing the catalytic performance. This review extensively analyzes various zeolite synthesis routes and their influence on POM. It better explains the structure-function relationship between their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance. The applications of zeolites in POM are also investigated, focusing on their role as catalysts in methane conversion to value-added products (e.g., syngas). In addition, the interaction between metals and zeolites is evaluated, highlighting the synergistic effects that occur when metal species are incorporated into the zeolite structure. Finally, perspectives on the state-of-the-art zeolite synthesis approach for POM are provided, paving the path for further development and novel discoveries in this exciting field of study.
