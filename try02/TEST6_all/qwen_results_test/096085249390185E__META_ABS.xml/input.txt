Liquefaction of hydrolytic eucalyptus lignin with formate in water, using batch and continuous-flow reactors Hydrolytic eucalyptus lignin, obtained from a commercial hydrolysis plant, was liquefied with formate in water under pressure. In a batch reactor the conversion at 270°C and 13 MPa was only 49·3% and the oil yield 44·8%. Using a simple, low cost, continuous-flow reactor at 300°C and 12 MPa, the conversion could be increased to 65·4% and the oil yield to 61·0%. The oil contained 25 to 30% oxygen and was mostly composed of substituted phenols. Of the oil, 42% was distillable and contained guaiacol and 2,6-di-methoxyphenol as principal products. Other substituted phenols were identified in smaller amounts. A possible industrial utilization of the products is discussed.
