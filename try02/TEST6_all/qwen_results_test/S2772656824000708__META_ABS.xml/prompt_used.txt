You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of high-value carbon nanotubes from real waste plastic towards the negative carbon technology The preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from plastics is of great significance for realizing high value utilization of waste and reducing carbon emission. Here, several kinds of real waste plastics were introduced into catalytic pyrolysis, and the process was also optimized. The results showed that the presence of impurities (e.g., adhesive labels) reduced the initial activation energy of the pyrolysis reaction, and the pyrolysis process was extended and could be divided into two stages. During the catalytic process, impurities play a toxic role on the catalyst at higher temperatures and result in the agglomeration of catalyst particles and a decrease in catalytic activity. Less than 10 wt.% carbon fibers were collected from milk cup waste. However, after experimental optimization, the influence of the impurity component was greatly reduced. The toxic effect of organic impurity volatiles on a catalyst was avoided by employing a segmented catalytic pyrolysis process, which led to an increase in solid carbon content of more than 20 % for express package waste. Simultaneously, more uniform and smoother CNTs can be found in the obtained solid carbon. The process of preparing carbon nanotubes with higher yield and better quality is feasible and has important application prospects in the utilization of waste plastics.
