You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards producing high-quality lignin-based carbon fibers: A review of crucial factors affecting lignin properties and conversion techniques The production of low-cost and high-quality carbon fibers (CFs) from biorenewable lignin precursors has been of worldwide interest for decades. Although numerous works have been reported and the proposed “1.72 GPa/172 GPa” target set by the Department of Energy (DOE) has been closely met in a few studies, most lignin-based CFs (LCFs) have poor strength properties compared to industrial PAN (polyacrylonitrile)-based CFs. The production of LCFs involves several steps, and the final quality of LCFs is governed by both lignin's properties and the manufacturing processes. Therefore, understanding the key factors of producing high quality LCF is of high importance. In this review, we firstly outlined several lignin's properties (e.g., impurities, thermal properties, molecular structure) that may play important role in determining its processability and suitability as carbon fiber precursor. Secondly, conversion strategies include spinning, stabilization and carbonization, and corresponding parameters influencing the final quality of LCF are comprehensively analyzed. Last, additional characterization methods are proposed as a means to facilitate analyzing of lignin and LCF. This review attempts to provide insights towards high-quality LCF production from both material and manufacturing aspects.
