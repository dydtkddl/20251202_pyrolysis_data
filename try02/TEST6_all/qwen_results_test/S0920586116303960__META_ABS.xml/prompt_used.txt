You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mo influence on the kinetics of jatropha oil cracking over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts The aim of this work is to study the influence of Mo on the kinetics of jatropha oil cracking on HZSM-5 catalysts, in order to select catalytic materials for the production of renewable fuels and hydrocarbons as raw chemicals for the petrochemical industry. Jatropha oil was selected as a model compound of an acidic non edible vegetable oil unsuitable for biodiesel production by conventional transesterification technology. Jatropha oil was used either pure or adsorbed on Mo/HZSM-5 surfaces. A model free kinetics was developed from non-isothermal thermogravimetric experiments of vegetable oil cracking. Fast cracking experiments were performed in a micro-pyrolysis set up, at 650°C, under helium flow, with on line products analysis (GC/MS). Results show that the increase in the Mo content of HZSM-5 induced a decrease of both specific surface area and acidity. Mo also changed the amount and distribution of hydrocarbons obtained during cracking reactions, increasing monoaromatics and decreasing polyaromatics. TG and DTG profiles during decomposition followed by thermogravimetry indicate that the jatropha oil/catalyst mixture led to a sharp decrease in the temperature at which the main mass loss events occurred. The different values obtained for the apparent activation energy of jatropha oil decomposition suggest a different route of reaction in the presence of Mo by comparison with cracking of pure oil.
