Waste biomass-derived activated carbons for various energy storage device applications: A review Energy, water, and clean air constitute the fundamental necessities for human survival, and these resources are deeply interconnected. The detrimental effects of modern lifestyle activities and increasing energy requirements have led to amplified use of fossil fuels. This situation is further exacerbated by the improper disposal of substantial amounts of biomass waste, especially in developing nations. However, there is an innovative solution that can address these pressing issues - the carbonization process, which transforms biomass waste into valuable advanced materials. Among the extraordinary materials generated through this procedure are porous activated carbons derived from diverse forms of biomass. Our discussion has explored various biomass sources for activated carbon and their corresponding electrochemical characteristics. Within the realm of energy storage applications, we have delved into the utilization of bio sources including waste tyre, wood, lotus husk, banana peels, bamboo waste, green tea waste, datura, and pineapple leaves in the form of activated carbons. These activated carbons possess remarkable energy storage capabilities in supercapacitors, with reported specific capacitances reaching an impressive value 1400 F/g. Furthermore, we have highlighted the functionalities of supercapacitors and batteries, as well as the distinct roles played by their individual components in energy storage. This all-inclusive assessment not only summarizes the most recent advancements in biomass-derived activated carbon but also underscores its pivotal role in storing energy. Moreover, the assessment delves into the key factors that influence the efficiency of biomass-derived activated carbon in these specific applications, perfectly catering to the requirements of future demands.
