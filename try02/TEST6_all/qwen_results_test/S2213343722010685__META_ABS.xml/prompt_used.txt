You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photocatalytic degradation of polystyrene nanoplastics in water. A methodological study The ability of a wide span of characterization and analytical tools to provide reliable, quantitative data for monitoring the efficiency of photocatalysis in the mineralization of calibrated polystyrene nanobeads was studied. Both slurry and immobilized reaction modes were compared, and polystyrene nanoparticles of different characteristic sizes were used as model compounds for developing a suited methodological approach. We demonstrated that tests in the immobilized mode showed an unequivocal advantage over the slurry mode and in consequence should be preferred to get rid of the restrictive presence of the nanoparticulate photocatalyst within the samples to be analysed. At best, the results in the slurry mode revealed the existence of a photocatalytic activity towards polystyrene nanobeads, with no capacity of reliable quantification. Direct imaging or indirect light-scattering characterization giving a direct access to the size of the nanoplastic particles cannot provide fully relevant data, as the polystyrene substrate was reported to lose its nanobead morphology during the photocatalytic attack, in parts or entirely, with the simultaneous release to the water of polystyrene macromolecules. Py-GC/MS allowed the polystyrene concentration to be followed with time, but with no access to the concentration of polystyrene nanoparticles. TOC analysis remained the most suited and reliable technique to monitor and quantify the mineralization of polystyrene nanoplastics by photocatalysis. UV-Vis spectrophotometry was reported to be a fast, non-destructive alternative technique to TOC analysis in the specific case of polystyrene.
