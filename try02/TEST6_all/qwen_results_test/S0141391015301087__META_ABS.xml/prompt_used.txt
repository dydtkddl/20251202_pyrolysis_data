You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel crosslinkable epoxy resins containing phenylacetylene and azobenzene groups: From thermal crosslinking to flame retardance Several kinds of novel flame-retardant-free and thermo-crosslinkable epoxy resins (EPs) containing azobenzene or/and phenylacetylene groups have been synthesized and characterized, and the flame retardant properties as a result of thermal crosslinking during combustion were investigated in detail. Crosslinking behaviors were tested by simultaneous thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TGA–DSC). Thermal stabilities were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Flame retardance of the resulting EPs was evaluated through LOI tests, and combustion behaviors were studied via cone calorimetry and micro-combustion calorimetry (MCC), which further confirmed that flame retardance of these EPs was significantly improved, despite the absence of conventional flame retardant. Py–GC/MS analysis was used to investigate the degradation mechanism of these epoxy resins, and the results confirmed that the flame-retardant activity of epoxy resins mainly took effect in the condensed phase. The chemical constitution of the char layers were investigated by XPS and Raman spectrum. The co-crosslinking behavior between azobenzene and phenylacetylene groups was predicted and confirmed, which led to the most compact char layer, therefore resulted in the best flame retardance of these EPs.
