You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2 sequestration with serpentinite and metaperidotite from Northeast Portugal The application of a staged process for CO2 sequestration by mineralisation, studied at Åbo Akademi University (ÅA), to abundant minerals from Northeast Portugal, is presented. Mg is extracted from magnesium silicates using recoverable ammonium salts (ammonium sulphate – AS and ammonium bisulphate – ABS), precipitated in the form of Mg(OH)2 and subsequently carbonated at 20bar CO2 partial pressure. The concept of the process is promising since the Mg extraction requires heat at ∼450°C while the Mg(OH)2 carbonation produces heat at ∼500°C. Samples of serpentinite and metaperidotite were collected from Bragança and their theoretical capacity for CO2 mineralisation, in Northeast Portugal, was estimated to be 3.4Gt of CO2. All the samples were mineralogically and physically characterized using X-ray diffraction and ICP-OES techniques and microscopic observation of thin sections. The reactivity of the samples, for Mg(OH)2 production, was tested at different temperatures (350–500°C) with AS and ABS, in different mixing conditions and both in the presence and absence of water. Metaperidotite was shown to be more reactive than serpentinite. The produced Mg(OH)2 was carbonated in a pressurized fluidized bed at ÅA. The maximum Mg extraction (using ABS) and Mg(OH)2 carbonation levels reached were 80% and 70%, respectively.
