You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Leaching behavior of microplastics during sludge mechanical dewatering and its effect on activated sludge Dewatering is an indispensable link in sludge treatment, but its effect on the microplastics (MPs) remains inadequately understood. This study investigated the physicochemical changes and leaching behavior of MPs during the mechanical dewatering of sludge, as well as the impact of MP leachates on activated sludge (AS). After sludge dewatering, MPs exhibit rougher surfaces, decreased sizes and altered functional groups due to the addition of dewatering agents and the application of mechanical force. Meanwhile, plastic additives, depolymerization products, and derivatives of their interactions are leached from MPs during sludge dewatering process. The concentration of MP-based leachates in sludge is 2–25 times higher than that in water. The enhancement of pH and ionic strength caused by dewatering agents induces the release of MP leachates enriched with protein-like, fulvic acid-like, and soluble microbial by-product-like substances. The reflux of MP leachates in sludge dewatering liquor to the wastewater treatment system negatively impacts AS, leading to a decrease in COD removal rate and inhibition of the extracellular polymeric substances secretion. More importantly, MP leachates cause oxidative stress to microbial cells and alter the microbial community structure of AS at the phylum and genus levels. These findings confirm that MPs undergo aging and leaching during sludge dewatering process, and MP leachates may negatively affect the wastewater treatment system.
