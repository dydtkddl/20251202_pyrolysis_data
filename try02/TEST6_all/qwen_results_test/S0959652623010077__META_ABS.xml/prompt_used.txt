You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass to produce aromatic hydrocarbons in a cascade dual-catalyst system: Design of red mud based catalyst assisted by the analysis of variance Theoretical and experimental study on the catalytic pyrolysis of rape straw was carried out for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons using the composite red mud (RM) and zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst as the combined catalysts. In the orthogonal tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was originally established that Fe2O3 and CaO acted as the active metal oxides in the red mud, which played the notable role in the production of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) as hydrocarbon fuels. Subsequently, the physicochemical property of the Fe2O3 and CaO loaded red mud (Fe2O3-RM and CaO-RM) was investigated and their performance in the catalytic pyrolysis of rape straw combined with HZSM-5 were investigated. It was revealed that the further cracking of the primary pyrolysis gas was promoted with more active Fe2O3 involved, and the heavy component was converted into the light fraction entering HZSM-5 for deoxygenation and aromatization to produce aromatic hydrocarbons. The yield of BTX over Fe2O3-RM was boosted by 10.15 wt% compared with the original red mud catalyst, while that of BTX was further promoted to 11.37 wt% over the composite red mud catalyst with 6% CaO loading. In addition to the strong bond-breaking performance of CaO, calcium carboxylate was easily generated and then decomposed to form CaCO3 and ketones, and then BTX were produced from ketones over HZSM-5 by deoxygenation and aromatization. In this study, the high-performance red mud-based catalysts was designed and utilized in the thermochemical conversion of biomass, providing a potential way for the utilization of two solid wastes, rape straw and red mud to produce hydrocarbon fuels in a high-valued way.
