Catalytic co-liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and polyethylene for bio-oil production under supercritical conditions: Effect of catalysts Catalytic co-liquefaction of high-density polyethylene and sugarcane bagasse over metal salt and oxide catalysts in ethanol solvent was investigated. The obtained bio-oil samples were analyzed and characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultimate analysis (CHNS/O), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and different solid products characterized by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. The results suggested that adding ZnSO4 gives the highest HHV (34.61 MJ/kg), while CuSO4 gives the highest bio-oil yield (38.42 %) and conversion (69.54 %). GC–MS analysis suggested that the bio-oils contained large amounts of hydrocarbons, phenols, ketone aldehydes, alcohols and esters. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were integrated over spectral regions to quantify classes of carbon and hydrogen atoms in each bio-oil and suggested that bio-oils largely contain alkanes, aliphatics and alcohols. The liquid products are promising bio-fuel precursors for further utilization.
