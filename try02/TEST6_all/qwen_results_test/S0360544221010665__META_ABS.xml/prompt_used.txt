You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on products characteristics from catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass based on the effects of modified biochars Biochar was produced from peanut shells pyrolysis and then modified by HCl and MnCl2, and the effects of modified biochars on the pyrolysis products characteristics were investigated. The catalytic effect of the biochar prepared at 650 °C is more suitable, and the products under 650 °C have lower acid content and higher phenol content than that under other temperatures. It was found that the modification effect of low concentration of MnCl2 was not obvious, which manifested as a higher phenol content under the catalysis of the HCl modified biochar. Then, different concentrations of MnCl2 were adopted and the highest phenol yield was obtained at 1.5 mol/L, which was higher than that of direct pyrolysis, about 78.9%. Besides, its acid yield was also the lowest, and the reduction was about 37.5%. The phenol products were analyzed under different concentrations of MnCl2 modified biochar and the results showed that the selectivity of alkylated phenol substances was greatly improved. When MnCl2 is 0.8 mol/L, the CO2 content was lowest, while the H2 content was highest, the increment was up to about 92.8% compared with that of direct pyrolysis. Therefore, the co-modified biochar with HCl and MnCl2 can better promote lignin cracking and generate more phenols.
