Research progress of oxygen carriers for the chemical looping process of different feedstocks Chemical looping technology (CLT) is an innovative technology that involves clean and efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into power, fuel, and chemicals through oxygen carriers (OCs) by circulating between a fuel reactor (FR) and an air reactor (AR). Several processes such as chemical looping combustion (CLC), chemical looping gasification (CLG), and chemical looping reforming (CLR) have been proposed and investigated based on the various OCs. OCs act as a medium that transfers heat and oxygen, are related to their efficiency, economy, and stability of the cyclic reaction in the whole chemical looping process (CLP). In recent years, significant progress has been made in OC materials for various CLP. Particularly, multi-metal coupled high-entropy oxide oxygen carriers (HEO-OCs) and the method of using machine learning for high-throughput screening of OCs provide new perspectives for the development and application of OCs. However, there is currently a lack of review paper on the selection of suitable OCs for different CLP and different feedstock types. In this paper, the types, preparation methods and evaluation indexes of OCs are summarized, and the development methods and application cases of OCs based on the characteristics of feedstocks are mainly reviewed. It is expected to provide a better understanding for the development and utilization of OCs in the CLP. These advantages will contribute to the development of OC materials for more effective CLT.
