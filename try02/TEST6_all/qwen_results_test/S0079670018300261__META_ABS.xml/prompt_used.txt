You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polymeric composites for powder-based additive manufacturing: Materials and applications As one of the most important categories in the additive manufacturing (AM) field, powder-based techniques, such as selective laser sintering, electron beam melting and selective laser melting, utilize laser or electronic beams to selectively fuse polymeric, metallic, ceramic or composite powders layer-by-layer into desired products according to their computer-aided design models. With unique mechanical, thermal, electrical, biocompatible and fire-retardant properties, polymeric composite materials for powder-based AM have been attracting intensive research interests because of their potential for a wide variety of functional applications in aerospace, automobile, marine and offshore, medical and many other industries. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on polymeric composite materials, their powder preparation for AM, and functionalities and applications of their printed products. It begins with the introduction of thermoplastic polymers that have been used as the main matrices of the polymeric composites and various composite reinforcements such as metallic, ceramic, carbon-based fillers and polymer blends for strengthening and functionality purposes. Discussion is then made on the processes for manufacturing such polymeric composites into powder form, which include shear pulverization, solution-based methods and melt compounding methods, with a focus on their advantages, limitations and challenges in terms of their productivity and processibility as well as powder printability. Thereafter, the properties and functionalities of the printed products and their various intriguing applications particularly in biomedical (anatomical models, tissue engineering and drug delivery), aerospace, automobile, military, energy and environmental, acoustic devices and sports equipment are highlighted. Finally, this review is concluded with an outlook on polymeric composites for powder-based AM, new opportunities, major challenges and possible solutions.
