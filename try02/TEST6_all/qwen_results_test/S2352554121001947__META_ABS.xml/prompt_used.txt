You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with high-density polyethylene to produce chemicals and bio-oil with high liquid yields The pyrolysis of waste plastic and lignocellulosic material feedstocks increases the hydrogen/carbon ratio of the plastic-biomass mixture and may be advantageous for refining the properties of pyrolysis oil, which can be directly used as a fuel without any need for upgrading by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation. In this paper, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and brown salwood were tested in a custom-built laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor to investigate the co-pyrolysis reaction at temperatures ranging from 500 to 650 °C, nitrogen flow rates ranging from 40 to 160 mL min−1, and HDPE-to-biomass ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. The results revealed that the temperature mostly influenced the pyrolysis products, whereas increasing the temperature to 600 °C promoted pyrolysis oil production, reaching a yield of 35.10 ± 1.20 wt%. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 650 °C decreased the yield to 34.57 ± 0.49 wt% because secondary cracking reactions produce a noncondensable gas rich in hydrocarbons. Physicochemical analysis of the pyrolyzed organic phase revealed a gross calorific heating value of up to approximately 38.19 MJ kg−1. Additionally, co-pyrolysis of HDPE improved the production of furans, and acid derivatives were obtained in the aqueous fraction via the thermal conversion of hemicellulose and lignin; conversely, the obtained char exhibited a notably low surface area and few superficial micropores and was used to further develop activated carbon for use as a catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of waste materials.
