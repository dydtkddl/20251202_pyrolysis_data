You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of co-pyrolysis of bamboo waste and polypropylene on biomass deoxygenation and carbonization processes While numerous research studies have delved into the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, limited attention has been devoted to comprehending the interaction mechanism that impacts biomass deoxygenation and carbonization. Therefore, this study explores the co-effect of temperature and polypropylene blending ratio on co-pyrolysis reaction kinetics, distribution of oxygenates/hydrocarbons, as well as the evolution of biochar structure. At a blending ratio of 0.5, the co-pyrolysis exhibits the lowest activation energy (146 kJ/mol), approximately 25.1 % lower than that required for individual pyrolysis. The interaction between bamboo waste with polypropylene increases the O-abstraction process, resulting in the creation of O-containing free radicals and hydrocarbon compounds. The peak proportion of aromatic compounds, reaching approximately 69.5 %, is observed at 700 °C when the blending ratio is 0.5. The H-abstraction process converts large-molecular alkanes into H free radicals and tiny-molecular unsaturated hydrocarbons. The aliphatic functional group content diminishes as the polypropylene ratio increases. The maximum specific surface area (7.70 m2/g) and pore volume (21.7 mm3/g) are achieved at a blending ratio of 0.75. Notably, polypropylene exerts minimal influence on the graphite crystallite size and graphitization degree of biochar. This research significantly contributes to advancing our understanding of the interaction mechanisms between biomass and plastic waste.
