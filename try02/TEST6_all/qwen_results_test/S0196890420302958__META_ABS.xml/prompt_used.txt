You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing jet fuel range hydrocarbons production from catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir and low-density polyethylene over bifunctional activated carbon catalysts Low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts are vital to the conversion of solid wastes into biofuels or chemicals. In this study, a bifunctional activated carbon catalyst modified with Fe (Fe/AC) was obtained and applied to the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir (DF) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using a facile fixed bed reactor. The effects of Fe loading amount, catalyst to feedstock ratio, and pyrolysis temperature on the product yields and distributions were studied. Results showed that the highest yield of bio-oil (53.67%) was achieved using 10Fe/AC at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C with a catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1. The main chemical compositions of the obtained catalytic bio-oil were aromatics, alkanes, and phenols. Increasing the temperature (450–600 °C) and catalyst to feedstock ratio (0.5–2) enhanced the selectivity of aromatics at the expense of phenols and alkanes. Compared to the AC catalyst, Fe/AC exhibited excellent performance on aromatics production (especially mono-aromatics) due to the newly created acid sites. The catalytic synergistic effect over 10Fe/AC significantly promoted the formation of aromatics through hydrogen transfer reactions which facilitated the dehydroxylation and demethoxylation of phenols. The present work provides a promising approach of converting biomass and plastic wastes directly into jet fuel range hydrocarbons by using green inexpensive carbon-based catalysts.
