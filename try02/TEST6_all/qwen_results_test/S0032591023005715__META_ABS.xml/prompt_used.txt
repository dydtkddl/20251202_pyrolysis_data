You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical investigation of drag property for fluid flow through packed beds of super-quadric chip-like particles Drag property of fluid flow through chip-like particles is essential for describing the microscale flow pattern of this unique system, yet it is not well developed. In this work, a correlation of drag force (F d ) specific for the super-quadric chip-like particles is formulated under the conditions of porosity ε = 0.48–1.0 and Reynolds number Re = 10–200, using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and discrete element method (DEM). The LBM-DEM model is validated against previous data with an average deviation of 5% (max ∼15%). The results indicate that the ε and Re are two dominant parameters that determine the F d on chip-like particles. A new F d correlation consists of ε and Re is developed. Comparisons are conducted between this F d correlation with previous approximate correlations including Di Felice-Holzer/Sommerfeld hybrid drag model for arbitrary-shaped particles and Chen/Müller drag model specific for cubes, indicating that an accurate description of the particles' shapes is vital in providing suitable F d information. The new F d correlation can be applied to Euler-Euler simulations of industrial-scale processes of chip-like particles involved in fluid flow systems such as end-of-life (EoL) solar panels recycling and biomass chips gasification.
