Numerical investigation of drag property for fluid flow through packed beds of super-quadric chip-like particles Drag property of fluid flow through chip-like particles is essential for describing the microscale flow pattern of this unique system, yet it is not well developed. In this work, a correlation of drag force (F d ) specific for the super-quadric chip-like particles is formulated under the conditions of porosity ε = 0.48–1.0 and Reynolds number Re = 10–200, using the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and discrete element method (DEM). The LBM-DEM model is validated against previous data with an average deviation of 5% (max ∼15%). The results indicate that the ε and Re are two dominant parameters that determine the F d on chip-like particles. A new F d correlation consists of ε and Re is developed. Comparisons are conducted between this F d correlation with previous approximate correlations including Di Felice-Holzer/Sommerfeld hybrid drag model for arbitrary-shaped particles and Chen/Müller drag model specific for cubes, indicating that an accurate description of the particles' shapes is vital in providing suitable F d information. The new F d correlation can be applied to Euler-Euler simulations of industrial-scale processes of chip-like particles involved in fluid flow systems such as end-of-life (EoL) solar panels recycling and biomass chips gasification.
