You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Materials for in-vessel components The EUROfusion materials research program for DEMO in-vessel components aligns with the European Fusion Roadmap and comprises the characterization and qualification of the in-vessel baseline materials EUROFER97, CuCrZr and tungsten, advanced structural and high heat flux materials developed for risk mitigation, as well as optical and dielectric functional materials. In support of the future engineering design activities, the focus is primarily to assemble qualified data to supply the design process and generate material property handbooks, material assessment reports, DEMO design criteria and material design limits for DEMO thermal, mechanical and environmental conditions. Highlights are provided on advanced material development including (a) steels optimized towards lower or higher operational windows, (b) heat sink materials (copper alloys or composites) and (c) tungsten based plasma facing materials. The rationale for the down-selection of material choices is also presented. The latter is strongly linked with the results of neutron irradiation campaigns for baseline material characterization (structural, high heat flux and functional materials) and screening of advanced materials. Finally, an outlook on future material development activities to be undertaken during the upcoming Concept Design Phase for DEMO will be provided, which highly depends on an effective interface between materials’ development and components’ design driven by a common technology readiness assessment of the different systems.
