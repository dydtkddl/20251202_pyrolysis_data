Materials for in-vessel components The EUROfusion materials research program for DEMO in-vessel components aligns with the European Fusion Roadmap and comprises the characterization and qualification of the in-vessel baseline materials EUROFER97, CuCrZr and tungsten, advanced structural and high heat flux materials developed for risk mitigation, as well as optical and dielectric functional materials. In support of the future engineering design activities, the focus is primarily to assemble qualified data to supply the design process and generate material property handbooks, material assessment reports, DEMO design criteria and material design limits for DEMO thermal, mechanical and environmental conditions. Highlights are provided on advanced material development including (a) steels optimized towards lower or higher operational windows, (b) heat sink materials (copper alloys or composites) and (c) tungsten based plasma facing materials. The rationale for the down-selection of material choices is also presented. The latter is strongly linked with the results of neutron irradiation campaigns for baseline material characterization (structural, high heat flux and functional materials) and screening of advanced materials. Finally, an outlook on future material development activities to be undertaken during the upcoming Concept Design Phase for DEMO will be provided, which highly depends on an effective interface between materials’ development and components’ design driven by a common technology readiness assessment of the different systems.
