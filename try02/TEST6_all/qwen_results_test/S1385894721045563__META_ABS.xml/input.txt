Kinetics on 1,3-butadiene dimerization by the cycloaddition reactions in high pressure and high temperature micro-reactor The kinetics of 1,3-butadiene dimerization based on the cycloaddition reactions including Diels-Alder reaction under high temperature and high pressure were investigated in a microchannel reactor. Our findings suggest that the butadiene dimerization produced 4-vinyl-cyclohexene (VCH) and 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD). The results indicate that COD can only be formed under high temperature conditions. The apparent kinetic parameters of butadiene dimerization under high pressure were obtained by fitting experimental data. As the reaction pressure increased, the reaction rate in the solution was found to increase slightly. Compared with the gas phase dimerization of butadiene in the literature, it can be concluded that the reaction rate constants in the liquid phase are greater than that in the gas phase. To our best knowledge, this is the first work reporting the kinetic parameters of butadiene dimerization with the radical polymerization excluded under high pressure liquid phase condition.
