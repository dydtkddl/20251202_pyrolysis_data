The use of mathematical and computer models to explore the applicability of fluidized bed technology for highly exothermic catalytic reactions. I. Oxidative dehydrogenation of butene A mathematical model for the oxidative dehydrogenation of butene in a fluidized bed reactor is developed in order to investigate the possibility of exploiting the advantages of this reactor configuration for such a highly exothermic reaction. The model is based on the two phase theory of fluidization and allows for the change in volumetric gas flow rate in the dense phase due to the change in number of moles accompanying the reaction. Interphase mass transfer coefficients are calculated on a component-wise basis. The bifurcation behaviour of the system is investigated with special emphasis on its implication on conversion, yield and selectivity. The effect of different parameters on the behaviour of the system is also investigated.
