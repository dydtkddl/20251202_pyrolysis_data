You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-stage co-pyroysis behaviors and product distribution of Enteromorpha and marine waste polypropylene catalyzed by Cu/HZSM-5 A two-stage co-pyrolysis approach was developed for the efficient utilization of marine waste plastics and biomass, with a focus on the influence of biomass components. HZSM-5 was modified with Cu via wet impregnation and applied in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Enteromorpha and polypropylene under varying catalyst-to-feedstock ratios. The Cu/HZSM-5 catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that Cu modification preserved the HZSM-5 framework while increasing pore size, enhancing catalytic cracking efficiency. Thermogravimetric and kinetic analyses revealed that Cu/HZSM-5 lowered the pyrolysis temperature, reduced residues, improved synergy, and decreased activation energy without altering the reaction mechanism. The catalyst significantly reduced oxygenated compounds and enhanced the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil products, reaching a maximum aromatic content of 90.20 % at a 6:5 catalyst-to-feedstock ratio in the second stage. Under the same conditions, hydrogen production in the gas phase also peaked at 47.91 %. Increased catalyst dosage decreased carbon and hydrogen content in the char while raising oxygen and nitrogen levels, with a higher H/C ratio mitigating char aromatization and densification. A reaction mechanism for Enteromorpha and polypropylene over Cu/HZSM-5 was proposed. This study provides insights into the catalytic co-pyrolysis of marine waste plastics and biomass with complex compositions.
