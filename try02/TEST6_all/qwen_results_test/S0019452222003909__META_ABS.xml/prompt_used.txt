You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk with SnCl2, Al2O3.4SiO2.H2O, and MoS2 for improving the chemical composition of pyrolysis oil and gas Pyrolysis of Indian variety rice husk was carried out in a semi-batch reactor in the presence of SnCl2, Al2O3.4SiO2.H2O, and MoS2 catalysts at a fixed temperature (550 °C), heating rate (50 °C min−1), and N2 flow rate (0.3 L min−1). The yield of pyrolysis oil increased in the presence of Al2O3.4SiO2.H2O catalyst but deteriorated in presence of SnCl2, and MoS2 catalyst. At 550 °C, the maximum pyrolysis oil yield from non-catalytic pyrolysis (NCP) was 37.46 wt% and with Al2O3.4SiO2.H2O catalyst it was 38.41 wt%. The yield of H2 (7.27 mol %) in pyrolysis-gas after catalytic pyrolysis (CP) was 0.72 mol% higher than NCP (6.55 mol %). The gross calorific value (GCV) of pyrolysis-gas after CP increased to 5.99 MJ m−3 from 3.84 MJ m−3 (NCP). High lignin contained in rice husk gave a better CH4 yield of 10.13 mol. %. Reduction in water content (3.07–5.77 wt %) of pyrolysis oil after CP elevated the high heating value (HHV) to 28.61 from 22.41 MJ kg−1. A 3.0–4.58 mol. % reductions in the acidic compound content after CP impacted the pH and TAN of pyrolysis oils. The Al2O3.4SiO2.H2O catalyst elevated the area percentage of naphthenic (0.54 mol. %), olefinic (1.98 mol. %), aromatic (4.18 mol. %), and paraffinic (4.42 mol. %) compounds in pyrolysis oil. A 3.86 mol. % increase in the phenolic compounds was observed in presence of MoS2 catalyst. Approximately, 22 wt% loss in oxygen with 21 and 2.65 wt% increases in the carbon and hydrogen content of biochar elevated the HHV to 30.60 MJ kg−1 after CP.
