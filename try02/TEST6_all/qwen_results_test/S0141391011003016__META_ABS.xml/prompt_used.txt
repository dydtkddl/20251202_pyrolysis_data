You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and properties of phosphorus polyesters with systematically altered phosphorus environment Monomers with phosphorus-containing substituents were incorporated into aromatic–aliphatic polyesters to develop polymeric halogen-free flame retardants as additives for poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT). They were built into the polyester backbone of PBT substituting 1,4-butane diol as monomer by phosphorus-containing aromatic–aliphatic diols. Starting from 10-(2,5-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl)-9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phospha-phenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO-HQ-GE), the chemical structure of the phosphorus monomers was systematically varied resulting in new polymers with diphenyl phosphine oxide substituents and bridged phosphine oxide units. The polymers were prepared by transesterification polycondensation in the melt in lab-scale as well as in a 2.4 l-autoclave. The properties of the polyesters were determined and compared to the DOPO-based polyester with respect to the achieved molar mass and polydispersity, solid state structure, glass transition temperature, thermal stability and combustion behavior. It was found that the different phosphorus substituents lead to different glass transition temperatures. The polymers containing bridged phosphorus structural units showed higher glass transition temperatures T g and resulted in higher char yields after thermal decomposition. Both phosphine oxide structures showed only one-step decomposition with a shoulder at the end of the step. In contrast, two separate steps were observed in the polyesters with DOPO-substituents. The results indicated that the phosphorus polyesters under discussion are suitable to adjust the flame retarding mechanism.
