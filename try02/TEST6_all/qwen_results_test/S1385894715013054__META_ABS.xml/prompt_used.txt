You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation, characterization and properties of PVDF-g-PAMPS/PMMA-co-PAMPS/silica nanoparticle as a new proton exchange nanocomposite membrane In this study, preparation and characterization of PVDF/PMMA-co-PAMPS/silica nanocomposite membranes as a new proton exchange membrane were investigated. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) containing pendant sulfonic acid groups was synthesized by grafting through RAFT polymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) from vinyl pendent groups of already modified PVDF as a macro-monomer. The synthesized PVDF graft copolymer (PVDF-g-PAMPS) was blended with miscible copolymer containing sulfonated segments (PMMA-co-PAMPS) and sulfonic acid functionalized silica nanoparticles in order to achieve high performance nanocomposite proton exchange membrane. It was found that the addition of PMMA-co-PAMPS copolymer resulted in a significant increase in porosity and slight reduction in crystallinity of the nanocomposite membranes, which favored the water uptake and proton transport at ambient temperature. Both the water uptake and the ion-exchange capacity (IEC) of the nanocomposite membranes were increased by increasing silica nanoparticles loading. The maximum proton conductivity was 20mS/cm at 25°C for the nanocomposite membrane containing 10% silica nanoparticles. Also, this nanocomposite membrane showed a power density as high as 34.3mW/cm2 at peak current density of 140mA/cm2. The thermal and mechanical properties of these nanocomposite membranes were also studied.
