You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Processing of low-density waste in fluidized bed made out of lightweight expanded clay aggregate The main aim of the study is to obtain a new, innovative method for the organization of combustion processes in fluidized bed reactors. A key aspect of the change in the organization of the fluidized bed combustion process is the creation of a fluidized bed made out of lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA). The new fluidized bed has a density of 0.5 g/cm3, therefore, allowing for thermal processing of low-density solid and liquid industrial wastes, as well as waste biomass. Polyolefins (polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and polypropylene homopolymer) were selected as examples of low-density solid wastes. The use of an innovative fluidized bed for liquid waste degradation was studied on the example of glycerol combustion. Waste wood chips were chosen to represent low-density biomass. Thermal degradation of selected materials in the fluidized bed made out of LECA was carried out at a temperature range of 500–900 °C with an interval of 100 °C. Video analysis of the fluidized bed surface proved the sinking of waste materials into the bed and significant elimination of diffusion flames in the freeboard. Qualitative and quantitative flue gas analysis was carried out using the FTIR spectrometer. More than 95% conversion of the carbon contained in the polyolefins to CO2 was achieved already at 700 °C. At 500 °C, more than 30% of the polymeric carbon left the reactor as aromatic compounds. To avoid the emission of harmful aldehydes during the thermal processing of glycerol, the bed should be heated to at least 800 °C. Waste wood chips as an alternative fuel can be thermally incinerated in the fluidized bed made out of LECA. The disappearance of volatile organic compounds and CO emissions occurred at 700 °C and 800 °C.
