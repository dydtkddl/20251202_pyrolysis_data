You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on sustainable lignin extraction techniques, modifications, and emerging applications Lignin is the second most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer and presents a sustainable and renewable alternative to non-renewable aromatic polymers. Its inherent properties have sparked significant interest in the synthesis of high-value products and platform chemicals, including phenolic bioactive compounds, eco-friendly antioxidants, bio-based plastics, composites, and adhesives for non-formaldehyde wood resins and packaging applications. Lignin can be obtained from various lignocellulose biomass and various processes such as pulp production and second-generation bioethanol production. Recently, various extraction methods, such as the use of solvents including ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents, and organo-solvents, have been developed to produce lignin with desirable characteristics. The extraction of lignin with the required properties is crucial for its suitability for various applications, and the source and the extraction methods employed influence the quality of lignin. After extraction, lignin undergoes various chemical modifications to enhance its potential for transformation into value-added products. This article provides a comprehensive overview of lignin sources, extraction methods, modification technologies and diverse industrial applications. The review also discusses the future potential of lignin in the transition towards a more sustainable and bio-based economy.
