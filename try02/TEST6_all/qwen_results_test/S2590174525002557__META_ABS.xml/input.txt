Integrative approach to hydrothermal gasification of food waste for hydrogen production: experimental validation, techno-economic assessment, and mathematical modeling This study conducts a techno-economic and environmental analysis to assess the viability and benefits of H2 production from food waste via hydrothermal gasification (HTG). Experimental results were used to examine the effects of critical parameters, including temperature, reaction time, and catalyst use, on H2 yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to explore the relationships among operational factors and to develop a mathematical model that forecasts various experimental outcomes. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was utilized to analyse the chemical properties of bio-oil. The most favourable parameters for this process are 350 °C and 18 MPa, resulting in a maximum yield of 796 mL after 90 min. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) significantly enhances H2 production to approximately 800 cc, surpassing the performance of other catalysts. FTIR analysis reveals the chemical complexity of bio-oil, which presents promising prospects for sustainable fuel. Replacing 1.9 Mt of coal, 1.3 Mt of diesel, and 1.19 Mt of natural gas with H2 can result in a cost savings of M$ 228 by 2023. This comprehensive study offers a comprehensive perspective on implementing H2 energy through HTG technology.
