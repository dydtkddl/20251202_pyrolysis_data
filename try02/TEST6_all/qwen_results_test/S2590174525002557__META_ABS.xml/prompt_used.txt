You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrative approach to hydrothermal gasification of food waste for hydrogen production: experimental validation, techno-economic assessment, and mathematical modeling This study conducts a techno-economic and environmental analysis to assess the viability and benefits of H2 production from food waste via hydrothermal gasification (HTG). Experimental results were used to examine the effects of critical parameters, including temperature, reaction time, and catalyst use, on H2 yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to explore the relationships among operational factors and to develop a mathematical model that forecasts various experimental outcomes. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was utilized to analyse the chemical properties of bio-oil. The most favourable parameters for this process are 350 °C and 18 MPa, resulting in a maximum yield of 796 mL after 90 min. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) significantly enhances H2 production to approximately 800 cc, surpassing the performance of other catalysts. FTIR analysis reveals the chemical complexity of bio-oil, which presents promising prospects for sustainable fuel. Replacing 1.9 Mt of coal, 1.3 Mt of diesel, and 1.19 Mt of natural gas with H2 can result in a cost savings of M$ 228 by 2023. This comprehensive study offers a comprehensive perspective on implementing H2 energy through HTG technology.
