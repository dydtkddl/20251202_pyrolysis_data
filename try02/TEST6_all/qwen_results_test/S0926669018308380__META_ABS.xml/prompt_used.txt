You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics of poplar sawdust by pretreatment of anaerobic fermentation Pyrolysis characteristics of poplar sawdust (PS) pretreated by anaerobic fermentation were investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis. Results indicated that with an increase of pretreatment time from 0 to 20 days, the contents of cellulose and hemicellulose decreased from 54.05 and 17.96 wt. % to 51.29 and 12.61wt. % and the contents of the extractives and lignin increased from 1.41 and 26.58 wt. % to 7.31and 28.19 wt. %, respectively. The bio-pretreatment enhanced the starting pyrolysis temperature and increased the remains at 700 °C. Distinct weight loss of cellulose between 250–350 °C were observed at the TGA curves of P5, P10 and P20. Activation energy increased from 87.90 to 103.21 kJ mol−1. The bio-oil yield and product distributions also changed. Sugars content firstly increased from 7.64 to 16.73% and then decreased to 13.70%. The content of linear carbonyls initially decreased from 12.40 to 8.64% and then increased to 14.39%. Phenols show similar changing pattern. Its content changed from 24.72 to 22.54 and then 25.03%. The contents of linear acids, linear ketones and furans decreased. The contents of laevoglucose, hydroxyl acetaldehyde and 1, 2-benzenediol in the bio-oil increased from 4.54, 10.78 and 3.07% to 12.30, 13.30 and 5.44%, respectively. This indicated the pyrolysis selectivity of PS was improved. Effects of anaerobic fermentation on wood pyrolysis behaviors were remarkably different not only from straw biomass but from that of white- and brown-rot fungi.
