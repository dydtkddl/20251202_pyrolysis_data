A review of exploring the synthesis, properties, and diverse applications of poly lactic acid with a focus on food packaging application Polylactic acid (PLA) is an aliphatic polyester, which is primarily synthesized from renewable resources through the polycondensation or ring-opening polymerization of lactic acid (LA)/lactide. LA can be conveniently produced via the fermentation of sugars obtained from renewable sources such as corn and sugar cane. Due to its biodegradable and biocompatible nature, PLA exhibits a vast range of applications. Its advantages include non-toxicity, environmental safety, and compatibility with human biological systems. PLA finds significant use in various biomedical applications, including implants, tissue engineering, sutures, and drug delivery systems. Additionally, PLA serves as a renewable and biodegradable polymer of extensive utility in film production, offering an alternative to petrochemical-based polymers. Moreover, the properties of PLA-based films can be tailored by incorporating extracts, polysaccharides, proteins, and nano-particles. This review encompasses LA production, PLA synthesis, and diverse applications of PLA and further explores the potential of PLA in the realm of packaging.
