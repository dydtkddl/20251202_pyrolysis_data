You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process optimization and techno-economic analysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) depolymerization in a non-aqueous alkaline environment for monomer recovery and reuse This study presents a comprehensive investigation into optimizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) depolymerization under alkaline conditions using response surface methodology (RSM). The critical process parameters studied were temperature, NaOH concentration, and reaction time. In the first phase, the combined effect of ozone pretreatment and ultrasound assistance on depolymerization efficiency was examined, revealing a positive direct correlation. In the second phase, RSM optimization with ozone pretreatment with ultrasonication conditions achieved 83.58% terephthalic acid (TPA) recovery and a total monomer recovery of 92.14%. Notably, applying the RSM-optimized conditions to virgin PET samples without pretreatment yielded comparable results thus highlighting the importance of statistical optimization tools. Techno-economic analysis using RSM optimized conditions for plant capacities ranging from 2.4 to 72 MT/day identified a minimum selling price of $1,533 USD/MT for TPA at the largest making it competitive with virgin TPA and other depolymerization methods. Sensitivity analysis highlighted feedstock and equipment costs as primary economic drivers, revealing opportunities for cost optimization.
