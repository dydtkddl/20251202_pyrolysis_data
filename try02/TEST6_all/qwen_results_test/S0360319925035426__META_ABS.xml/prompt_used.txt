You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanism of catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and polypropylene for hydrogen production: An experimental and DFT simulation study Co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) waste and cotton stalks (CS) addresses the dual environmental challenges of plastic pollution and agricultural residue disposal while leveraging their complementary properties (PP: H-rich; CS: C, O-rich) for enhanced H2 production. This study investigated the hydrogen production mechanism of lignocellulose via microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-MACFP) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations for the conversion of CS and PP. Co-MACFP (550 °C) with a SiC absorber was applied to PP-CS blends (1:1 ratio), mesoporous HZSM-5 (tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH)-modified, HT-1.0), and Ni-loaded HT-1.0 catalysts. The reaction mechanisms were determined via DFT simulations using β-d-glucopyranose and propylene as molecular models. The concentration of H2 obtained from the co-pyrolysis of CS and PP (the ratio is 1:1) was 32.7 vol% without catalysts, which exceeds the average concentration of 28.4 vol% ((27.1 + 29.7)/2) at 550 °C, indicating a synergistic effect between CS and PP. In addition, synergistic effects boost the H2 yield to 38.0 vol% with Ni-HT1.0 (vs. 32.7 vol% without catalysts), exceeding the theoretical averages from the individual feedstocks. PP-derived H· radicals (energy barrier: 454.8 kJ/mol) attack CS intermediates as the dominant low-energy pathway (204.4 kJ/mol), suppressing CO/CO2 formation via DFT. This integrated strategy enables efficient waste valorization and generation of green hydrogen. Future work should scale up catalyst synthesis and explore hybrid processes to improve economic viability.
