You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis reaction mechanisms and chlorine migration of tetrachlorobiphenyl a through the integration of ReaxFF-MD and DFT Flame retardants, especially Tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), one of the waste materials from renewable energy devices, are becoming a significant environmental concern. While pyrolysis has emerged as a promising method for the disposal of TCBPA-containing waste, the complex molecular mechanisms and reaction pathways involved in TCBPA pyrolysis remain largely unknown. In this work, an integrated approach combining Reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD), Density Functional Theory (DFT), and thermogravimetric-Mass Spectroscopy (TG-MS) techniques was employed to scrutinize TCBPA pyrolysis at the microscopic level. ReaxFF-MD simulations were performed to investigate the pyrolysis process over a wide temperature range (2200–3200 K), revealing complex pyrolysis mechanisms with multiple reaction pathways, including β-scission, dechlorination, dehydrogenation, dehydroxylation, and the formation of chlorinated products, such as HCl, C2HCl, and CH3Cl. The primary gaseous by-products detected in the TCBPA pyrolysis align with the results from ReaxFF simulations. The computational outcomes reveal that the primary reaction sites in TCBPA pyrolysis are B1 (bridgehead carbon) and B2 (chloro-substituted carbon), collectively representing roughly 80 % of total reactions. The DFT results show that hydrogen and chlorine detachments from various functional groups have distinct energy requirements, contingent upon specific energy barriers. Additionally, minor coking events occur during pyrolysis, leading to marginal tar and char production, which is temperature dependent. The pyrolysis pathways of TCBPA were unraveled and the potential environmental hazards associated with chlorinated organic pollutant byproducts, such as HCl, were highlighted. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this study provides insights and guidance for the disposal of TCBPA-containing waste in an environmentally friendly manner.
