You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Correlation between the kinematic properties of carrier particle bubbles and their particle entrainment phenomena During froth flotation, minerals enter the concentrate either through true flotation or mechanical entrainment. These two processes occur simultaneously and they determine the efficiency and selectivity of the process. This study proposes use of a bubble surface load value to quantitatively characterize the level of particle adhesion on bubbles. A visual experimental platform was constructed using a high-speed camera system and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles as the base material for the particle bed. Variations in the bubble surface load values and particle entrainment phenomena were evaluated under different particle sizes and superficial gas velocities. The morphological changes in particle-laden bubbles, including bubble size, vertical ascending velocity, and horizontal motion velocity, were evaluated. The correlation between the ascending behavior of particle-laden bubbles and the particle entrainment phenomenon was also explored. The results indicated that, under a particle size of 300 μm, increasing the superficial gas velocity reduced particle adhesion on bubbles, resulting in a lower bubble surface load value. However, using a smaller particle size (300 μm) effectively mitigated the impact of increased superficial gas velocity on the bubble surface load value. Bubbles with a surface load value exceeding 40 % exhibited more significant particle entrainment in the vortex beneath them, whereas those with a surface load value below 40 % showed less entrainment. The results demonstrated that the degree of particle entrainment was correlated with the vortex shedding and the motion characteristics of the bubbles. These findings provide valuable insights for developing advanced mineral flotation strategies.
