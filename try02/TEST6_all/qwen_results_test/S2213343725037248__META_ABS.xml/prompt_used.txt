You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the pyrolysis mechanism of PE and PP catalyzed by endogenous transition metals in spent lithium-ion batteries Investigating the catalytic effect of transition metals on polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis is crucial for efficient lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling. Molecular dynamics simulations results were demonstrated that the pyrolysis of PE and PP is effectively catalyzed by transition metals, leading to an increased pyrolysis reaction rate and promoting the production of small molecular compounds. Py-GC/MS results showed that at 460°C, the C1-C10 product content from PE pyrolysis was 1.78 % without a catalyst and increased to 5.82 %, 7.16 %, and 8.09 % with Co, Ni, and Cu catalysts, respectively. For PP, the C1-C10 content was 23.37 % without a catalyst, rising to 36.56 %, 38.33 %, and 41.84 % with Co, Ni, and Cu. These findings indicate that transition metals enhance small molecule production, with PP being more easily pyrolyzed than PE. Quantum calculations revealed electron transfer between metals and H atoms in the polymers, altering electron density and catalyzing pyrolysis by changing bond dissociation energies. Emergy and environmental impact analysis indicates that the pyrolysis of PE and PP under the effect of Ni achieves the best performance in terms of environmental impact control and reduced emergy consumption, compared to Co and Cu, highlighting the excellent catalytic role of Ni in promoting plastic decomposition and improving reaction efficiency.
