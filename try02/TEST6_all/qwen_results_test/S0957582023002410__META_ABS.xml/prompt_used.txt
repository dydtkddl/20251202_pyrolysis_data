You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-cost activated carbon from the pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste and the application in CO2 capture Chemical recycling by pyrolysis of plastic waste has been considered a potential approach. However, little attention has been paid to the reuse of the char residue generated. The preparation of materials from char residue obtained from the pyrolysis process has become an essential task. The purpose of this work is the preparation of activated carbons from the resulting char from the pyrolysis of a dirty and wet mixture of post-consumer plastic waste. The porous materials have been applied to the adsorption of CO2. Both physical and chemical activation methods were investigated to modify the surface texture properties. The properties of the developed activated carbons were characterized by diverse techniques such as elemental and proximate analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), adsorption-desorption isotherms with N2, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Among all synthesized samples, the activated samples prepared by chemical activation with KOH (char: KOH ratio 2:1; surface area, 487.0 m2·g−1) exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption uptake (∼49 mg·g−1). The activation temperature was explored within 680–840 ºC. For physical activation, an increase in the activation temperature decreases the adsorption uptake of the samples. For chemical activation, the adsorption increased as activating temperature rise to a maximum value, subsequently decreasing with further temperature rise. Increasing the amount of the chemical activating agent significantly decreases the adsorption capacities. The best-activated carbon was chosen, and several parameters were investigated on CO2 adsorption, C: KOH mass ratio (6:1–1:4), and adsorption temperature (15–60 °C). The highest adsorption of CO2 achieved was 62.0 mg·g−1 for activated carbon operating at the lower adsorption temperature (15 ºC).
