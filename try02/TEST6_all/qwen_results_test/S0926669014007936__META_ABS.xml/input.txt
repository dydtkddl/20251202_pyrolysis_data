Bonding performance of wood bonded with adhesive mixtures composed of phenol-formaldehyde and bio-oil This study investigated the bonding performance of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesive containing different amounts of pyrolysis bio-oil. The amount of bio-oil in the PF adhesive was gradually increased to 40wt%. Pine wood sawdust was converted into renewable chemical feedstock for the production of bio-based phenolic adhesive. The chemical composition of the bio-oil, and the viscosity and pH of each type of adhesive mixtures were analyzed. The bonding performance of the adhesive mixtures was determined using single lap-joint tensile specimens. The results showed the bond quality of the PF adhesive containing 20wt%, bio-oil was better than that of the commercial PF adhesive under dry conditions. The PF adhesive containing 20wt% the bio-oil met the requirements for durability classes of 1–3 specified in EN 12765, (2002). Environmentally friendly adhesives from biomass can be used as a substitute for existing petroleum based PF adhesive in the manufacture of wood-based panels.
