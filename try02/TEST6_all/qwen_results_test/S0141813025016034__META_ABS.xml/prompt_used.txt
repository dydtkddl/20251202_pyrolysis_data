You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-step calcined cellulose-derived NiNx nanoclusters catalyst: Unleashing non-radical peroxymonosulfate activation for accelerated p-nitrophenol degradation Carbon-based catalysts doped with transition metals effectively activate persulfate for the advanced oxidation of endocrine disruptors in water. However, research on nickel-doped catalysts is limited, especially regarding non-radical mechanisms, and typically focuses on synthetic organic compounds rather than natural cellulose. This study used wheat straw cellulose to synthesize NiNx nanocluster catalysts (Ni-NC) via a one-step calcination method. The Ni-NC/peroxymonosulfate system significantly enhanced the mass transfer between the catalyst, PMS, and contaminants, resulting in a 95.8 % removal efficiency of p-nitrophenol (PNP) within 30 min. Experimental results showed that non-radical pathways, particularly involving singlet oxygen and electron transfer, were key to PNP degradation. This study emphasizes the crucial role of nickel atomic sites in PNP removal through electron transfer processes between Ni(II) and Ni(III). It further confirms the formation of Ni-O bonds, indicating the presence of high-valent metal‑oxygen species. Fukui function analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified three PNP elimination pathways with minimal toxicity intermediates, as predicted by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool. These results enhance the effective synthesis of nickel-doped biocatalysts sourced from natural cellulose and establish a theoretical framework for controlling non-radical pathways in water treatment processes.
