You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of carbon filler content on the performance of SiOC/C electrodes for energy production in bio-electrochemical systems Silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) electrodes are emerging as alternatives to traditional carbon-based anodes in microbial fuel cells; however, their electrical conductivity remains low. To overcome this, carbon fillers are typically incorporated into the SiOC matrix, under the assumption that higher electrical conductivity enhances bio-electrochemical performance. Nevertheless, a systematic study on the effect of carbon filler content in SiOC/C electrodes has not been yet conducted, so this assumption requires validation. In this work, SiOC/C electrodes with varying micro-graphite (MG) contents and controlled porous architecture were developed. A positive exponential correlation between electrical conductivity and MG content was observed for the electrodes. When tested in bio-electrochemical cells, anode current densities at steady-state effectively scaled with the filler content, reaching maximum values when 20 or 30 wt% MG was used. However, the highest microbial growth rate and electrical charge provided were both strikingly achieved with 20 wt% filler, the overall bio-electrochemical performance being thus determined not only by electrical conductivity, but also by a proper balance of electrode surface roughness and the particular physiological stage during biofilm evolution. These findings suggest that the optimum carbon content in SiOC/C electrodes, leading to enhancing their bio-electrochemical performance, does not correspond to the highest electrical conductivity value.
