You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface hydroxyl-rich BiOCl/TiO2 and microwave pretreatment synergistically promote photocatalytic degradation of high density polyethylene microplastics Solid-solid interfacial contact inefficiency between photocatalyst and microplastics (MPs) poses significant challenges for the efficient photocatalytic degradation of MPs. In this study, an innovative synergistic strategy was developed by combining a surface hydroxyl-enriched BiOCl/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst with microwave pretreatment, aiming to achieve a remarkable degradation rate of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) MPs under mild conditions. Comprehensive characterization confirmed that microwave pretreatment disrupted the crystalline structure of HDPE MPs, inducing surface defects, and reduced polymer chain entanglement, thereby significantly enhancing their susceptibility to photocatalytic degradation. When coupled with the BiOCl/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst, the microwave-pretreated HDPE MPs achieved a weight loss rate of 63.13 % within 20 h, corresponding to an increase of 2.94 and 2.5 times in degradation rate compared to pure BiOCl and TiO2, respectively. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the enhanced performance originated from two synergistic effects: (1) the heterojunction structure promoted charge separation, effectively inhibiting electron-hole recombination, and (2) the hydroxyl-rich surface not only provided active sites for ·OH radical generation through h+ oxidation but also enhanced adsorption of fragmented organic intermediates via hydrogen bonding. Overall, this synergistic approach combining pretreatment with surface engineering provides new insights into the design of high-performance photocatalytic systems for recalcitrant polymer degradation.
