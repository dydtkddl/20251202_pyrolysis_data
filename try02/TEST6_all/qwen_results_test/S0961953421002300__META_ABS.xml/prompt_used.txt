You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potassium demineralization of coconut fiber via combined hydrothermal treatment and washing: Effect on pyrolysis kinetics, mechanisms, and bio-oil composition Producing clean energy from waste biomass via pyrolysis is critical in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and alleviating their environmental impacts. Inherent potassium in low energy density coconut fibers reduces bio-oil yield and compromises bio-oil quality and the integrity of reactors within which pyrolysis occurs. The effect of consecutive hydrothermal treatment (180°C-220 °C) and water washing on coconut fiber demineralization, pyrolysis behavior, and bio-oil composition was investigated. Chemical fractionation method classified the most occurring inorganic (potassium) as ~76% water-soluble, ~19% ion-exchangeable, and ~5% acid-soluble species. Demineralization results show that combined pretreatment at ≤200 °C leached out all water-soluble and exchangeable potassium. However, at 220 °C, electrostatic attraction and increased tortuosity imposed by the high density of oxygenated functional groups and a well-developed porous structure hamper demineralization. Nevertheless, a maximum potassium removal efficiency of 95% could be achieved. Although pretreatment marginally affects apparent activation energy, the reaction mechanism of hydrochars became insensitive to the heating rate between 10 and 50 °C min−1. Due to pretreatment, the selectivity of thermally stable phenolic and anhydrosugar derivatives increased at the expense of the light oxygenates of low thermal stability because of suppressing fragmentation reactions and enriching polymers with a high degree of polymerization. Light oxygenates decreased from 27.45 area % to 24.02, 16.33, and 13.32 area % for hydrochars produced at 180 °C, 200 °C, and 220 °C, respectively. Therefore, this pretreatment approach can produce inorganic-free, thermally stable, and chemically stable bio-oils.
