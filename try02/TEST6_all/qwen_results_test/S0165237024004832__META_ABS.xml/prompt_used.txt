You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An overview of catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste over base catalysts Excessive plastic consumption has enormous environmental consequences, including global climate change, the accumulation of non-biodegradable substances, and the depletion of fossil fuel resources. Accordingly, sustainable treatment of waste plastics must be prioritized to achieve a greener world while generating valuable energy products. Pyrolysis has been proven to be an environmentally friendly strategy for recycling plastic waste. In addition, the employment of catalysts in the pyrolysis process, particularly base catalysts, can improve the quality of the products. Base catalysts are highly selective for the formation of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, the basicity of the catalyst can influence the pyrolysis products. Catalysts with lower basicity promote the formation of aldehydes and ketones, whereas catalysts with strong basicity can encourage hydrocarbon production. In addition, base catalysts can enhance the quality of pyrolytic oil by decarboxylating acidic compounds. Accordingly, this review focuses on the pyrolysis of plastic waste by employing base catalysts. The correlation between catalyst features and catalytic activity in the pyrolysis of plastic waste was also emphasized.
