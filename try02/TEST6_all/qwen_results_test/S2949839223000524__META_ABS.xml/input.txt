Plastics in the marine environment: Could the seawater indicate a path for waste management? Despite the versatility of polymeric materials (plastic), they generate significant impacts on the environment. The actual plastic recycling system presents some unsolved issues since, worldwide, only a portion of this material is collected for recycling. The left waste generally can be discarded in landfills or sent for incineration resulting in the generation of large amounts of CO2. A viable solution for this could be chemical recycling as a treatment for plastic waste. This type of recycling consists of breaking polymer chains to generate products with commercial value. Due to their high cost or low efficiency, several CR methods are not used on a large scale. On the one hand, advanced oxidative processes using carbonate and bicarbonate anions can be a promising CR method for plastics since this system can degrade a range of molecules. In contrast, there are indications that the carbonate e bicarbonate anions could be correlated with plastic degradation in the marine environment. Maybe a solution for polymer waste management could be in the problem itself. This critical review aims to indicate possibilities for plastic waste management using CR combined with a carbonate/bicarbonate system.
