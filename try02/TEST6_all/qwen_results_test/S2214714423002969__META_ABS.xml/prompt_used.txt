You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments and mechanistic insights on adsorption technology for micro- and nanoplastics removal in aquatic environments The alarming prevalence of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in the environment has raised significant concerns. These particles have reportedly been detected in various human body fluids and waste, posing a major threat to human health. With long half-lives, high fragmentation propensity, and adsorption capacity for both heavy metals and organic contaminants, these plastic particles contribute to the degradation of aquatic and terrestrial environments and pose serious ecological risks to organisms and humans. Therefore, efficient and sustainable techniques are being developed to remove MPs from water and wastewater to achieve a plastic-free environment. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of adsorption technology as an efficient, easy-to-operate and sustainable remediation approach for removing MPs/NPs from aqueous environments, focusing on various adsorbents. The study delves into the mechanisms, efficiency, kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics associated with the performance of various adsorbents. In addition, it suggests innovative, eco-friendly, sustainable, and economically viable approaches for treating spent adsorbents, thereby facilitating a pollution-free environment devoid of MPs/NPs. However, several knowledge gaps persist, such as the need for fixed-column adsorption, computational approaches for understanding adsorbent-adsorbate binding interactions, and innovative ways for disposing of exhausted or spent adsorbents and removed adsorbates.
