Recent developments and mechanistic insights on adsorption technology for micro- and nanoplastics removal in aquatic environments The alarming prevalence of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in the environment has raised significant concerns. These particles have reportedly been detected in various human body fluids and waste, posing a major threat to human health. With long half-lives, high fragmentation propensity, and adsorption capacity for both heavy metals and organic contaminants, these plastic particles contribute to the degradation of aquatic and terrestrial environments and pose serious ecological risks to organisms and humans. Therefore, efficient and sustainable techniques are being developed to remove MPs from water and wastewater to achieve a plastic-free environment. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of adsorption technology as an efficient, easy-to-operate and sustainable remediation approach for removing MPs/NPs from aqueous environments, focusing on various adsorbents. The study delves into the mechanisms, efficiency, kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics associated with the performance of various adsorbents. In addition, it suggests innovative, eco-friendly, sustainable, and economically viable approaches for treating spent adsorbents, thereby facilitating a pollution-free environment devoid of MPs/NPs. However, several knowledge gaps persist, such as the need for fixed-column adsorption, computational approaches for understanding adsorbent-adsorbate binding interactions, and innovative ways for disposing of exhausted or spent adsorbents and removed adsorbates.
