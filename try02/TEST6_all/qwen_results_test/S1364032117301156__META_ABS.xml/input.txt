Development circumstances of four recycling industries (used motor oil, acidic sludge, plastic wastes and blown bitumen) in the world The conspicuous global challenges that we are departing towards them today comprise to be addressed in the multifaceted frameworks of economy, society, environment and technology. In recent years, the consensus of demanding for sustainable development and its implementation has been unanimously posed. Along with this affirm, high added value, knowledge-based, competitive sustainable manufacturing and business excellence have been widely scrutinized as a prominent enabler and handler especially in recycling industries sector. Current review survey encompasses the development circumstances of four major recycling industries in Iran and over the world. Thus, evaluation of the individual techniques exploited in the four recycling industries indicated that employed processes had the lowest economic outlay and the highest revenue in comparison to other technologies. Additives can be utilized as raw materials for production of economically valuable bituminous products. The recycling and converting processes are not only cost-effective, but they also descent the environmental risk to a large level, using new techniques to zero. Economic indices, business excellence score and the quality of the obtained products represented that these processes support sustainable development of industries.
