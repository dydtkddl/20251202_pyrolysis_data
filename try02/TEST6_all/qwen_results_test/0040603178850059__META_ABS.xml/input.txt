Simultaneous thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and pyrolysis—gas chromatography of fluorocarbon polymers The thermal degradation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) has been investigated in different gas atmospheres by simultaneous thermogravimetry—mass spectrometry, pyrolysis—gas chromatography, combined gas chromatography—mass spectrometry, and IR analysis. There are no significant differences in the decomposition products of the two polymers in helium or air at a temperature range of 450–790°C; C1 to C8 fluorocarbons and their oxidized products have been identified. The various fluorocarbons produced are plotted against the degradation temperature, and at temperatures of 450–550°C FEP evolves large amounts of tetrafluoroethylene formed by a decomposition reaction of perfluoropropylene. From the traces of the TG-MS in an atmosphere of helium, the FEP clearly decomposes in two stages. The first stage degradation is mostly attributed to the evolution of perfluoropropylene with a small amount of perfluoro-1-butene or perfluoroisobutylene, and possibly traces of perfluorocyclobutane. Tetrafluoroethylene is evolved with these fluorocarbons at the second stage degradation, showing similar characteristics of the degradation mechanisms of FEP at the two stages. In the presence of air, the two polymers also decompose in two stages. Activation energies for the degradation products are calculated, and the decomposition mechanisms of the polymers are discussed with the results of IR analysis.
