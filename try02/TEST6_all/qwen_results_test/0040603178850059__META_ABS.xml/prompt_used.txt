You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and pyrolysis—gas chromatography of fluorocarbon polymers The thermal degradation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) has been investigated in different gas atmospheres by simultaneous thermogravimetry—mass spectrometry, pyrolysis—gas chromatography, combined gas chromatography—mass spectrometry, and IR analysis. There are no significant differences in the decomposition products of the two polymers in helium or air at a temperature range of 450–790°C; C1 to C8 fluorocarbons and their oxidized products have been identified. The various fluorocarbons produced are plotted against the degradation temperature, and at temperatures of 450–550°C FEP evolves large amounts of tetrafluoroethylene formed by a decomposition reaction of perfluoropropylene. From the traces of the TG-MS in an atmosphere of helium, the FEP clearly decomposes in two stages. The first stage degradation is mostly attributed to the evolution of perfluoropropylene with a small amount of perfluoro-1-butene or perfluoroisobutylene, and possibly traces of perfluorocyclobutane. Tetrafluoroethylene is evolved with these fluorocarbons at the second stage degradation, showing similar characteristics of the degradation mechanisms of FEP at the two stages. In the presence of air, the two polymers also decompose in two stages. Activation energies for the degradation products are calculated, and the decomposition mechanisms of the polymers are discussed with the results of IR analysis.
