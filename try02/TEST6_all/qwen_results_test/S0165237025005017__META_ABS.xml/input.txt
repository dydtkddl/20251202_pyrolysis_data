A new catalytic deoxygenation technology of pine sawdust for rich single-ring aromatic bio-oil Biomass, as an inexhaustible source of clean energy, could be transformed into high-quality fuel by thermal chemical technologies. However, little literature has been reported on the novelty of biomass pre-deconstruction activation catalytic deoxygenation (PACD). In this work, the pine sawdust (PS) char, as an in-situ catalyst, was used to catalyze the deoxygenation of its deconstruction volatiles to achieve rich single-ring aromatic bio-oil with low CO2 emission. This study evaluated the influence of the PS char on the characteristics of three-phase products obtained from the PACD process. The special phenomenon of a decrease or an increase in char catalyst yield was analyzed in depth. After the process of pyrolysis (PP), isothermal catalytic deoxygenation (ICD), and the PACD process, the quality of three-phase productions was effectively improved in the PACD. The pre-deconstruction activation phase improved the H2/CO ratio to 1.00 in the PACD. After the PACD, the single-ring aromatics in oil had reached 49.72 % with a CO2 emission of 21.90 vol% at 650 ºC. And, the O concentration in oil and water yield dropped obviously. Following in-situ catalytic deoxygenation of PS char, the generation of carbon deposit led to a significant elevation in C content, which caused the PS char to tend towards graphite.
