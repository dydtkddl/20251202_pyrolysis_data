You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A new catalytic deoxygenation technology of pine sawdust for rich single-ring aromatic bio-oil Biomass, as an inexhaustible source of clean energy, could be transformed into high-quality fuel by thermal chemical technologies. However, little literature has been reported on the novelty of biomass pre-deconstruction activation catalytic deoxygenation (PACD). In this work, the pine sawdust (PS) char, as an in-situ catalyst, was used to catalyze the deoxygenation of its deconstruction volatiles to achieve rich single-ring aromatic bio-oil with low CO2 emission. This study evaluated the influence of the PS char on the characteristics of three-phase products obtained from the PACD process. The special phenomenon of a decrease or an increase in char catalyst yield was analyzed in depth. After the process of pyrolysis (PP), isothermal catalytic deoxygenation (ICD), and the PACD process, the quality of three-phase productions was effectively improved in the PACD. The pre-deconstruction activation phase improved the H2/CO ratio to 1.00 in the PACD. After the PACD, the single-ring aromatics in oil had reached 49.72 % with a CO2 emission of 21.90 vol% at 650 ºC. And, the O concentration in oil and water yield dropped obviously. Following in-situ catalytic deoxygenation of PS char, the generation of carbon deposit led to a significant elevation in C content, which caused the PS char to tend towards graphite.
