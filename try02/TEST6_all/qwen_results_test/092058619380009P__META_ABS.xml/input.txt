Low temperature carbon particulate oxidation on a supported Cu/V/K catalyst The oxidation of carbon black on a supported potassium-copper-vanadium catalyst was studied with the aim of characterise the mechanism of carbon gasification which is the basis of a treatment process based on catalytic post-combustion of particulate at the exhausts of oil fired power plants. In the presence of catalyst the temperatures of carbon black burn off were strongly lowered. Catalyst characterization suggested that a redox mechanism is responsible for the strong activity of the catalyst. Carbon oxides TPD measurements gave evidence that the energy of desorption of the carbon-oxygen surface complexes is dramatically modified by the presence of catalyst.
