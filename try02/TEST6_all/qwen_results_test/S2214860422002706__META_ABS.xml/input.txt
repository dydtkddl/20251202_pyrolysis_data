A comprehensive literature review on laser powder bed fusion of Inconel superalloys Inconel superalloys are one of the main classes of materials with good potential for production using the additive manufacturing process of laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB), which has a broad range of applications in the transportation and energy sectors. Thus, they have received considerable attention in the scientific literature, with researchers aiming to better understand their capabilities and limitations in recent decades. This review is based on around 340 publications spanning the past 14 years and highlights the most significant findings in the field along with the current challenges and research goals resulting from them. A contextualization is followed by a succinct microstructural review, which introduces the topics analyzed. The effects of the processing parameters, heat treatment and machining on the materials and their composites are evaluated and the performance of materials is compared in terms of their mechanical, corrosion and tribological behavior. Publications are mapped according to their research focus in order to reveal the current research trends in the literature.
