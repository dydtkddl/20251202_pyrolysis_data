You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bibliometric analysis of research trends on the thermochemical conversion of plastics during 1990–2020 The aim of this bibliometric analysis was to evaluate the trends in literature and the impact of publications that have been published during the period 1990–2020, in the field of thermochemical conversion of plastics, namely gasification, liquefaction and pyrolysis. SCOPUS was used and data was vetted via MS Excel, with analysis being completed via MS Excel and VOSViewer. A total of 1705 publications were used in the study, and China was identified as the most productive country. Pyrolysis was the most researched technology with over 88% of publications, while liquefaction accounted for less than 3% of the total publications. Across all three technologies, polyethylene (PE) was the most commonly occurring type of plastic. Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis had the highest number of publications and total citations. However, Energy Conversion and Management had a higher impact factor and higher average citations per publication. University of Alicante was identified as the most productive university with a total of 45 publications, while University of Leeds was the most commonly cited with an average of 65 citations per publication. The keyword analysis showed that co-pyrolysis with biomass and catalytic pyrolysis are gaining increased interests.
