Environmental impacts of activated carbon flakes from Palm fiber and polyolefin wastes using life cycle assessment Several research works have been attempted to utilize organic waste in producing useful goods. One such example includes the production of activated carbon (AC) from Palm fiber waste for adsorption applications. The process of converting palm fiber waste into AC consists of several steps, which may require heat, electricity, water, and chemicals. The products from waste utilization seem beneficial to the environment; however, a life cycle study is required to quantify environmental impacts and ensure their environmental feasibility. This study aimed to assess the embodied energy and carbon footprints of producing AC flakes from palm fiber waste and polyolefins through a life-cycle assessment (LCA). Incorporating plastics transforms powdered AC into easily removable flakes, addressing practical challenges in open water systems and enhancing its applicability in water treatment. The adsorption capacity of AC flakes was tested and found to be in the range of 200 to 240 mg/g depending upon the initial concentration of Rhodamine B dye. Furthermore, the LCA findings demonstrated that resources, such as chemicals and energy used for recycling, could have a significant impact on environmental outcomes. This research offers valuable perspectives for stakeholders in advancing a more sustainable and circular economic model using activated carbon flakes.
