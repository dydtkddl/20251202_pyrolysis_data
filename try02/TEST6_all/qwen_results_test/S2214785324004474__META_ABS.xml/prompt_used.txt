You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Environmental impacts of activated carbon flakes from Palm fiber and polyolefin wastes using life cycle assessment Several research works have been attempted to utilize organic waste in producing useful goods. One such example includes the production of activated carbon (AC) from Palm fiber waste for adsorption applications. The process of converting palm fiber waste into AC consists of several steps, which may require heat, electricity, water, and chemicals. The products from waste utilization seem beneficial to the environment; however, a life cycle study is required to quantify environmental impacts and ensure their environmental feasibility. This study aimed to assess the embodied energy and carbon footprints of producing AC flakes from palm fiber waste and polyolefins through a life-cycle assessment (LCA). Incorporating plastics transforms powdered AC into easily removable flakes, addressing practical challenges in open water systems and enhancing its applicability in water treatment. The adsorption capacity of AC flakes was tested and found to be in the range of 200 to 240 mg/g depending upon the initial concentration of Rhodamine B dye. Furthermore, the LCA findings demonstrated that resources, such as chemicals and energy used for recycling, could have a significant impact on environmental outcomes. This research offers valuable perspectives for stakeholders in advancing a more sustainable and circular economic model using activated carbon flakes.
