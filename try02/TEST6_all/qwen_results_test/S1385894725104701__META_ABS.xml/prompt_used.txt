You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in microplastics remediation via adsorption and photocatalytic degradation with bio-polymers and functionalized frameworks Micro/nano plastics have emerged as persistent environmental pollutants, posing significant ecological and human health risks. While conventional adsorption techniques can effectively capture these particles, they often fall short of achieving complete mineralization. In contrast, photocatalytic degradation enables molecular-level breakdown but is frequently hampered by poor stability and recyclability. To overcome these limitations, research is increasingly turning to bio-based materials, porous functional frameworks, and their hybrid composites as sustainable platforms for comprehensive microplastic remediation. This review systematically examines the fundamental mechanisms of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation, highlighting recent advances in bio-based materials (e.g., cellulose, chitosan) and porous frameworks (e.g., MOFs, COFs, and HOFs), as well as their synergistic combinations. Bio-based materials offer advantages including environmental compatibility, abundant functional groups, and renewable sourcing. Porous frameworks contribute tunable pore architectures, high surface areas, and pronounced photocatalytic activity. The strategic integration of these components creates composites that leverage their complementary strengths—enhancing adsorption capacity, facilitating interfacial charge transfer, and improving structural integrity—thereby enabling efficient and recyclable removal under realistic conditions. Furthermore, this review critically assesses the ecotoxicological safety, potential for metal ion leaching, and associated environmental risks of these materials. It incorporates techno-economic (TEA) and life-cycle assessments (LCA) to evaluate their scalability and overall sustainability. Finally, we emphasize the promising “waste-to-product” strategy, which converts agricultural and industrial residues into functional hybrid frameworks, thereby aligning microplastic remediation with the principles of a circular economy. This comprehensive overview offers theoretical guidance and practical insights for designing next-generation, sustainable systems for removing micro/nano plastics.
