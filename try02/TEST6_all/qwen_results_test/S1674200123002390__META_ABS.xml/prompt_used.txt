You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydroxyapatite composites with carbon allotropes: Preparation, properties, and applications Hydroxyapatite (HA) and its composites with inorganic additives, dopants, and polymers is a rapidly developing branch in the materials chemistry. In particular, carbon allotropes are widely used in these composites being widely applied for medical purposes. Observing a gap of insufficient generalization of recent achievements in the field of the HA/Carbon composites, in this review we present the state of the art of the field of HA composites and hybrids with classic carbon allotropes and nanocarbons. These composites are known for carbon nanotubes, nanofibers, graphene and its oxidized forms, as well as, in a lesser grade, for graphite, fullerenes, nanodiamonds, carbon nanofoams, etc. These composites can be fabricated by a variety of classic and less-common methods, such as co-precipitation (with or without ultrasonic treatment), CVD, hot isostatic pressing, hydrothermal, spark plasma sintering, biomimetic mineralization, thermal and plasma spray, electrochemical and electrophoretic deposition, self-assembling, 3D printing, electrospinning, and lyophilisation, among others. Combination of various synthesis techniques can be also carried out for composite preparation. Natural or synthetic HA can be used as it is for further interaction with carbon allotropes or it can be first prepared and then reacted with carbon counterpart; similarly, carbon allotropes can be introduced into the interaction with HA directly or they can be first synthesized, in particular from biomass. Resulting biocompatible composites can be produced in the form of coatings, powders, and scaffolds and can additionally contain quantitative amounts of third phases, frequently natural or synthetic polymers. In these composites, especially with O-containing functionalizing groups, HA disadvantages could be considerably decreased with simultaneous enhancement of mechanical properties, becoming similar to human bone, chemical stability and biocompatibility, as well as possessing antibacterial effect. GO→G reduction and higher HA decoration were observed in several experiments. The morphology of polymer-containing HA/GO composites can be tuned by variations of GO:polymer ratios. Predominant number of resulting applications of formed HA composites corresponds to the biomedical area, mainly for orthopedic applications/implants, osteoporosis treatment, myocardial, skin and dental regeneration, etc. Other important uses include applications as adsorbents for the elimination of impurities from wastewaters and/or removal/uptake of heavy metal cations, loading several medicines, and energy storage materials. Biocompatibility and hemocompatibility aspects of HA/Carbon composites are also discussed and future developments are proposed.
