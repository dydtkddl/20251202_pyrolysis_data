Recent progress of catalytic pyrolysis of biomass by HZSM-5 Biomass can be converted into a variety of fuels and chemicals using different technologies. One such process is fast pyrolysis, which is convenient for the conversion of biomass primarily into liquid products known as bio-oils. These bio-oils, however, must be upgraded if they are to be used as a replacement for diesel and gasoline fuels. At present, when improving the quality of bio-oils, catalytic vapor cracking is generally considered superior to other catalytic upgrading technologies, such as hydrotreating and esterification. This review summarizes the current status of research concerning both the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and the catalytic cracking of bio-oil using the zeolite HZSM-5, focusing on the specific catalysts employed, as well as the upgrading methods and reaction mechanisms.
