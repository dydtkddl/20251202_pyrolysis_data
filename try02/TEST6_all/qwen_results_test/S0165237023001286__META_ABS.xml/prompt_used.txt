You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted In-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and polystyrene mixtures: Response surface methodology analysis using machine learning Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS) are the major plastic fractions found in mixed plastic waste. Hence, the current study was focused to convert PP and PS into useful products via microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). In addition, the understanding of feedstock conversion, product yields, and energy requirements in pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis was investigated. Experiments were conducted at a constant microwave power of 450 W till the reaction temperature reached up to 600 °C. When PS pyrolyzed, a heating rate of 56 °C/min resulted in 80 wt% of oil yield. Whereas PP pyrolysis produced 42 wt% of oil at a heating rate of 76 °C/min. In the PP: PS co-pyrolysis, the heating rate was decreased to 52 °C/min by yielding 51 wt% of oil. In catalytic co-pyrolysis of PP: PS with KOH resulted in variation in product yields and heating rate. An increase in PS quantity at a constant mass of PP resulted in the enhancement of oil yields from 58 to 84 wt% and a decrease in gas yields. The specific microwave power in the catalytic co-pyrolysis (7–18 W/g) is lower compared to the non-catalytic case (22–30 W/g). Whereas, the pyrolysis time in non-catalytic pyrolysis (7–11 min) is lower compared to catalytic co-pyrolysis (14–37 min). The addition of a catalyst resulted in a decrease (23–50%) in microwave conversion efficiency than that of the non-catalytic case (60–85%). The difference in predicted and actual result analysis proved co-pyrolysis synergy in product formation and energy consumption.
