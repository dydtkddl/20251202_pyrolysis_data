Sustainable enzymatic treatment of organic waste in a framework of circular economy Enzymatic treatment of food and vegetable waste (FVW) is an eco-friendly approach for producing industrially relevant value-added products. This review describes the sources, activities and potential applications of crucial enzymes in FVW valorization. The specific roles of amylase, cellulase, xylanase, ligninase, protease, pectinase, tannase, lipase and zymase enzymes were explained. The exhaustive list of value-added products that could be produced from FVW is presented. FVW valorization through enzymatic and whole-cell enzymatic valorization was compared. The note on global firms specialized in enzyme production reiterates the economic importance of enzymatic treatment. This review provides information on choosing an efficient enzymatic FVW treatment strategy, such as nanoenzyme and cross-linked based enzyme immobilization, to make the process viable, sustainable and cheaper. Finally, the importance of life cycle assessment of enzymatic valorization of FVW was impressed to prove this approach is a better option to shift from a linear to a circular economy.
