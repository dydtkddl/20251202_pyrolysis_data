Promotion effect of tourmaline on methane catalysis by Co3O4 catalyst: mechanisms of crystal growth and oxygen vacancy regulation To address the critical challenges of enhancing low-temperature C − H bond activation while improving catalyst stability in methane catalytic oxidation, this study innovatively developed a tourmaline (TML)-Co3O4 composite catalyst. The optimized 2.5 % TML-Co3O4 composite demonstrated superior methane combustion performance (T90 = 382 °C, 15,000 mL·g−1·h−1) with enhanced stability, water resistance, and improved sulfur tolerance. Structural characterization (XRD, TEM, BET) revealed that TML effectively disrupted the rod-like morphology of Co3O4, inhibited grain growth, and increased specific surface area. TG, H2-TPR, and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that TML reinforcement strengthened Co − O bonding, thereby improving thermal stability. XPS and EPR further confirmed that TML induced high-density of oxygen vacancies (Ov), facilitating O2 adsorption and activation. O2-TPD, CH4-TPD and in situ DRIFTS collectively confirmed that the introduction of TML significantly enhances reactant adsorption capacity and accelerates the oxidation kinetic process.This work establishes a novel paradigm for designing high-performance methane oxidation catalysts while demonstrating the untapped potential of natural minerals in advanced catalytic material engineering.
