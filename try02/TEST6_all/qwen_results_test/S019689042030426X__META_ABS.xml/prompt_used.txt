You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The pyrolysis and combustion of polyoxymethylene in a fluidised bed with the possibility of incorporating CO2 The recycling of polyoxymethylene (POM) was performed in a fluidised bed which was formed from cenospheres (hollow, spherical particles). Air, N2 and CO2 were used as the fluidising agents. The composition of the process products in the flue gases as a function of fluidised bed temperature is shown and discussed for each fluidising gas. A flue gases FTIR analysis together with the spectra deconvolution of multicomponent gaseous samples were used to conduct instant quantitative monitoring of the products of POM thermal degradation. At 400 °C, in atmospheres of either air or CO2, the process of POM thermal recycling was performed for the purpose of monomer recovery and obtained a near 90% efficiency of formaldehyde formation. At temperatures above 600 °C, it was found that the use of air or N2 leads to the recovery of energy or gas rich in CO, respectively. The CO-rich gas was obtained during the pyrolysis of POM when CO2 constituted the fluidising agent. The amount of CO in the flue gas was almost twice as large as the amount of carbon introduced into the process in the polymer material. This means that carbon was converted to CO from the fluidising medium, thus recycling of POM to the CO-rich feedstock was obtained with a negative CO2 emission. The main advantage of the POM pyrolysis in the nitrogen atmosphere was monomer recovery.
