You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption on activated carbons from end-of-life tyre pyrolysis for environmental applications. Part II. Adsorption from aqueous phase Activated carbons (ACs) are well-known, versatile adsorbents with a wide range of applications, particularly in the removal of various environmental pollutants from the gas and liquid phases. However, relatively high costs associated with the use of commercial active carbons encourage the search for new, alternative precursors for their production, such as waste tires. This paper is the second part of the literature review on the use of activated carbon from end-of-life tire (ELT) pyrolysis for environmental applications. The first part discusses the methods of preparation of ACs, including ELT pyrolysis and activation of the obtained carbonisate, as well as their practical application for adsorption from the gas phase. The second part reviewed the applicability of activated carbons produced from waste tires in inorganic and organic compounds removal from aqueous solutions. The effectiveness of ACs with different physicochemical properties, as well as the adsorption conditions such as solution pH, and temperature have been presented. Based on the literature review, it can be concluded that activated carbons are widely used to remove metal ions and organic compounds from water, although in the latter case, the works are much more numerous. Among organic compounds, dyes were the most frequently tested group of pollutants, but many studies also concern the adsorption of other pollutants, e.g., phenolic compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons, drugs, or pesticides. The applicability of various adsorption kinetic and isotherm models for water contaminants removal by the ACs has also been reported here. To describe the adsorption kinetics, the authors primarily use the pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic models; kinetics most often follow the PSO model. Adsorption equilibrium is best described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. It is provenly evident in this review, that used tires can be efficiently converted into ACs, which are highly effective in removing contaminants from aqueous solutions.
