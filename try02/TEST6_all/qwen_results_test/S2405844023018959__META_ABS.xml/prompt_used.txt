You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of pine sawdust: Process modelling, performance optimization and economic evaluation for bioenergy recovery This study aims at optimizing the process conditions to extract maximum yields of bio-oil from pine sawdust using microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). Aspen Plus® V11 was used to model the thermochemical conversion of pine sawdust to pyrolysis products, and response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD) was employed in the optimization of the process parameters. The mutual effects of pyrolysis temperature and reactor pressure on the product distribution were investigated. The findings have shown that the optimal operating conditions for producing the highest amount of bio-oil (65.8 wt%) were achieved at 550 °C and 1 atm. The product distribution of the simulated model was more significantly influenced by linear and quadratic terms of the reaction temperature. In addition, a high determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9883) was obtained for the developed quadratic model. A set of three published experimental results acquired under circumstances comparable to the simulations' operating limitations were used to further validate the simulation results. The process’s economic viability was assessed in order to establish the bio-oil minimum selling price (MSP). A MSP of $1.14/L of liquid bio-oil was evaluated. An economic sensitivity analysis has shown that the annual fuel yield, required rate of return, annual income tax, annual operating costs and initial capital investment have a substantial impact on the MSP of bio-oil. It was inferred that using the optimized process parameters may improve the process' competitiveness on an industrial scale due to its better product yields and improved sustainability in biorefineries, as well as assure waste reduction.
