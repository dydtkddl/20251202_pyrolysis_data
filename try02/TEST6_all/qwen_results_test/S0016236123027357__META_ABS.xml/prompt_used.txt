You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidative stability of hydrocarbons produced by pyrolysis of polypropylene The instability of liquid oils issued from the pyrolysis of plastics usually leads to the degradation and the deterioration of their different properties. In this study, the stability of oils produced from the pyrolysis with and without reflux of polypropylene (PP) was investigated in a standard test device called PetroOxy. This work compares the stability of PP liquid oils with kerosene throughout their induction period and hydroperoxide (ROOH) content, two well-known stability parameters. Moreover, experimental investigations of the impact of a stabilizer (BHT = butylated hydroxytoluene) on the same stability parameters were achieved. A titration method and GC-MS were used to quantify ROOHs and to identify the oxidized liquid compounds, respectively. PetroOxy tests with BHT showed an enormous influence of BHT on the oxidation stability compared to all other oxidative tests. Adding 500 ppm of BHT multiplied the induction period by 5.9, 4.3, 10.7 and 6.7 for reflux liquid oils, no-reflux liquid oils mixed with kerosene, reflux liquid oils mixed with kerosene and pure kerosene respectively. The ROOH concentration was divided by up to 16.9 for reflux liquid oil when BHT was used. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the liquid oils obtained by pyrolysis with reflux are less stable than without reflux, and both of them are less stable than kerosene used as reference model. But using kerosene as solvent mixed with liquid oils obtained by pyrolysis with and without reflux increases their oxidative stability. The use of BHT as an antioxidant contributes to make these oils compatible for use as fuels.
