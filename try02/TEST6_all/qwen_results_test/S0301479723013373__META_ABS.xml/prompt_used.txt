You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A feasible approach for the treatment of waste computer casing plastic using subcritical to supercritical acetone: Statistical modelling and optimization Electronic waste (e-waste) usage has increased tremendously with the rapid evolution of technologies. The accumulated e-waste has now emerged as one of the crucial concerns regarding environmental pollution and human health. Recycling e-waste is commonly focused on metal recovery; nevertheless, a significant fraction of plastics (20–30%) are in e-waste. There is an indispensable need to focus on e-waste plastic recycling in an effective way, which has been mostly overlooked to date. An environmentally safe and efficient study is conducted using subcritical to supercritical acetone (SCA) to degrade the real waste computer casing plastics (WCCP) in the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) to achieve the maximum oil yield of the product. The experiment parameters were varied in the temperature span of 150–300 °C, residence time between 30 and 120 min, solid/liquid ratio between 0.02 and 0.05 (g/ml), and NaOH amount from 0 to 0.5 g. Adding NaOH into the acetone helps to achieve efficient degradation and debromination efficiency. The study emphasized the attributes of oils and solid products recovered from the SCA-treated WCCP. The characterization of feed and formed products is performed with different characterization techniques such as TGA, CHNS, ICP-MS, FTIR, GC-MS, Bomb calorimeter, XRF, and FESEM. The highest oil yield achieved is 87.89% from the SCA process at 300 °C, in 120min, 0.05 S/L ratio, and 0.5 g of NaOH. GC-MS results disclose that the liquid product (oil) comprises single- and duplicate-ringed aromatic and oxygen-containing compounds. Isophorone is the significant component of the liquid product obtained. Furthermore, SCA's possible polymer degradation mechanistic route, bromine distribution, economic feasibility, and environmental aspect were also explored. This present work represents an environmentally friendly and promising approach for recycling the plastic fraction of e-waste and recovering valuable chemicals from WCCP.
