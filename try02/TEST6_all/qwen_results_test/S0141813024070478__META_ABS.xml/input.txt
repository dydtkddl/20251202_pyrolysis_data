Excellent facile fabrication of PVA and lignin nanoparticles from wheat straw after novel DES-THF pretreatment The utilization of environmental friendly and renewable materials has received increasing attention recently. Lignin nanospheres (LNPs) prepared from recovered lignin and residual lignin after DESs and DESs-THF pretreatment were obtained by self-assembly in the present research. Then, films were prepared by incorporating them into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. The properties of various films were characterized and compared. Results showed that as the LNPs content increased, the UV blocking capacity of the films was gradually enhanced than PVA film. The DES-THF films showed better antioxidant properties up to 69 % due to higher phenolic hydroxyl content. The hydrophobicity of films incorporated with DESs-THF pretreated lignin was consistently better than that of DES pretreated. DES-THF-M films showed a higher Tmax than that of DES-M films, resulting in better thermal stability. Moreover, DES-THF-L films are lighter in color due to a lower degree of condensation, which is favorable to subsequent applications. The incorporation of LNPs improved mechanical and antioxidant properties, thermal stability, and UV shielding ability of PVA films, especially lignin after DES-THF pretreatment. In conclusion, the prepared PVA/LNPs composite films possessed good functional properties that make them potential for packaging materials.
