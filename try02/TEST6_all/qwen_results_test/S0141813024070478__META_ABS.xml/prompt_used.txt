You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Excellent facile fabrication of PVA and lignin nanoparticles from wheat straw after novel DES-THF pretreatment The utilization of environmental friendly and renewable materials has received increasing attention recently. Lignin nanospheres (LNPs) prepared from recovered lignin and residual lignin after DESs and DESs-THF pretreatment were obtained by self-assembly in the present research. Then, films were prepared by incorporating them into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. The properties of various films were characterized and compared. Results showed that as the LNPs content increased, the UV blocking capacity of the films was gradually enhanced than PVA film. The DES-THF films showed better antioxidant properties up to 69 % due to higher phenolic hydroxyl content. The hydrophobicity of films incorporated with DESs-THF pretreated lignin was consistently better than that of DES pretreated. DES-THF-M films showed a higher Tmax than that of DES-M films, resulting in better thermal stability. Moreover, DES-THF-L films are lighter in color due to a lower degree of condensation, which is favorable to subsequent applications. The incorporation of LNPs improved mechanical and antioxidant properties, thermal stability, and UV shielding ability of PVA films, especially lignin after DES-THF pretreatment. In conclusion, the prepared PVA/LNPs composite films possessed good functional properties that make them potential for packaging materials.
