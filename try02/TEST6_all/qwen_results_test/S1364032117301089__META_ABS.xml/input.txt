Current status of bioenergy technologies in Germany Bioenergy conversion technologies have been frequently described and analysed in the literature, but a comprehensive and detailed comparison between the complex individual characteristics of each technology is still lacking. Therefore, the paper contains a description of the technical, economic and environmental properties of each technology with a special focus on the German bioenergy sector. The study presents an analysis of different bioenergy applications with regard to their specifications, power/heat output range and their areas of application. Due to the fact, that biomass combustion applications are the most widespread and market proven renewable conversion technologies, a detailed analysis of decentralised, biomass-fired CHP plants is presented in the paper. The overview of the individual characteristics of different biomass conversion routes shows that biogas plants achieve high electrical efficiencies, are available with a broad range of capacities and belong to the established technologies. Although the investment costs of biogas plants are relatively high, biomass conversion with anaerobic digestion can be seen as one of the most promising option for a sustainable energy supply in Europe.
