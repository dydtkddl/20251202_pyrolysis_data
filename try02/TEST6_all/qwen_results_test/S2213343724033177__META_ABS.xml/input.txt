Advancements in radionuclide adsorption for wastewater treatment using metal-organic frameworks and cellulose composites The worldwide fossil energy shortage and rising demands has promoted the development of nuclear power, which leads to a significant issue of water contamination. Nuclear wastewater treatment becomes an important research subject. Metal-organic framework materials (MOF) have been considered as a promising candidate for radionuclide separation, due to their large specific surface areas, superb pore structure, and versatile surface functional groups. However, the application of pristine MOFs in this area faces a big hurdle for continuous, large-volume, and practical wastewater treatment. A concept of composite involving MOF appears to the right way forward. This paper outlines the recent advancements in MOF-based composites for radionuclide removal/capture, based on the performance of MOF composites across different substrates. Firstly, we will focus on the techniques used for the preparation and modification of various MOF-based composites. Then, an in-depth analysis of their contaminant removal abilities and the possible mechanisms of interaction between MOF-based composites and contaminants will be discussed. These interactions are discussed based on the experimental work, spectral analyses, and theoretical models. Thirdly, the efficacy of different materials in the removal of radionuclides. Finally, current and future challenges and potential applications of the MOF-based composites in environmental remediation will be presented, highlighting the necessity for further research that would lead to practical applications.
