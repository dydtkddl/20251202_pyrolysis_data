You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a fluidised bed reactor. Influence of the temperature and residence time The pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidised bed reactor was performed and the influence of the temperature and the residence time on the product distribution and gas composition investigated. Experiments at five different temperatures, 650; 685; 730; 780 and 850°C were carried out and the residence time was varied from 0.64 to 2.6 s. A total number of 20 runs were performed. Polyethylene was fed continuously into the bed and nitrogen was used as carrier gas and as fluidising agent. The results obtained showed the effect of these operating parameters on the production and composition of gases, oil and waxes. The temperature and residence time had a great influence on the pyrolysis product distribution within the range evaluated in this paper. At 640°C the main product obtained was a waxy cream coloured material (wax). The yield of this product varied from 79.7 wt.% at 0.8 s to 68.5wt.% at 1.5 s. At these conditions the gas yield varied between 11.4 wt.% at 1 s and 31.5 wt.% at 1.5 s. The waxes obtained are rich in aliphatic hydrocarbons up to C30. At high temperatures the product distribution changed drastically. The higher gas yields was obtained at 780°C, 86.4 wt.% of gas and 9.6 wt.% of oil, both at 1.34 s. The main hydrocarbons in this gas were ethylene, methane and propylene, the remaining products being oils with a high aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene and naphthalene) content. The H2, CH4, N2 and C2H x to C5H x compounds on the gas produced were analysed by gas chromatography, using a packed column and a molecular sieve.
