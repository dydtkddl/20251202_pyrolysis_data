You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in metal-organic frameworks for solid-state hydrogen storage: Synthesis, optimization, and perspectives Hydrogen energy is recognized as a promising secondary energy for sustainable development due to its high calorific value and environmental friendliness, yet its widespread applications are currently hindered by inefficient storage and need good storage methods to realize. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention as the promising materials for solid-state hydrogen storage (SHS) due to their high surface area, porosity, and structural tunability. A great deal of researches has demonstrated MOFs possess high hydrogen storage capacity in low-temperature and high-pressure conditions. This review provides a systematic overview of the synthesis methods of MOFs, optimization methodology, and the perspectives for future development. The synthesis methods of MOFs, including the solvothermal or hydrothermal method, microwave-assisted method, ultrasound-assisted method, electrochemical method, and mechano-chemical method, etc., were discussed and compared. Also, the optimization includes the structural design and post-synthesis modification, and they were introduced and analyzed in detail. Finally, the possible development direction of synthesis and optimization the MOFs for the future hydrogen storage practical applications was proposed. It aims to provide insights into the improvement of the hydrogen storage efficiency of MOFs, contributing to the realization of a sustainable hydrogen economy.
