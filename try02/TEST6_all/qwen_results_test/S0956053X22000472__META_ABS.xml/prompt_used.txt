You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The composition, energy, and carbon stability characteristics of biochars derived from thermo-conversion of biomass in air-limitation, CO2, and N2 at different temperatures This study systemically investigated the characteristics of biochars derived from thermo-conversion of pine sawdust and wheat straw in air-limitation, CO2, and N2 atmospheres at the temperatures of 300–750 °C. Meanwhile, their energy and C stability parameters were also evaluated here. The results showed that biochar produced in air-limitation had less yield, fixed C and bulk C, as well as more volatile matter and inorganic elements than that produced in CO2 and N2. Biochars derived from thermo-conversion of pine sawdust in CO2 and N2 at 450–750 °C had the greatest energy densification ratios (EDR) (range: 1.40–1.61), because pine sawdust contained more lignin than wheat straw, and the thermo-conversion of lignin in N2 and CO2 at 450–750 °C benefited for the formation of fixed C. Recalcitrance potential (R 50) results showed that the biochars produced in CO2 and N2 at 600–750 °C had the highest carbon stability (R 50: 0.54–0.64) for given biomass, owing to the thermo-conversion of biomass in CO2 and N2 at 600–750 °C preferring to form the organic C with high aromaticity and low polarity. Nonetheless, thermo-conversion of biomass in CO2 and N2 at 300 °C presented the greatest C sequestration potential, owing to high biochar yields under these conditions. Generally, the temperature-variability for the composition, EDR, and C sequestration potential followed the order: air-limitation > CO2 > N2, whereas carbon stability presented an opposite order. Our results contributed to selecting the appropriate atmosphere to optimize the properties and performances of biochars.
