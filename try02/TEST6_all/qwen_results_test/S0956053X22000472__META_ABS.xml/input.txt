The composition, energy, and carbon stability characteristics of biochars derived from thermo-conversion of biomass in air-limitation, CO2, and N2 at different temperatures This study systemically investigated the characteristics of biochars derived from thermo-conversion of pine sawdust and wheat straw in air-limitation, CO2, and N2 atmospheres at the temperatures of 300–750 °C. Meanwhile, their energy and C stability parameters were also evaluated here. The results showed that biochar produced in air-limitation had less yield, fixed C and bulk C, as well as more volatile matter and inorganic elements than that produced in CO2 and N2. Biochars derived from thermo-conversion of pine sawdust in CO2 and N2 at 450–750 °C had the greatest energy densification ratios (EDR) (range: 1.40–1.61), because pine sawdust contained more lignin than wheat straw, and the thermo-conversion of lignin in N2 and CO2 at 450–750 °C benefited for the formation of fixed C. Recalcitrance potential (R 50) results showed that the biochars produced in CO2 and N2 at 600–750 °C had the highest carbon stability (R 50: 0.54–0.64) for given biomass, owing to the thermo-conversion of biomass in CO2 and N2 at 600–750 °C preferring to form the organic C with high aromaticity and low polarity. Nonetheless, thermo-conversion of biomass in CO2 and N2 at 300 °C presented the greatest C sequestration potential, owing to high biochar yields under these conditions. Generally, the temperature-variability for the composition, EDR, and C sequestration potential followed the order: air-limitation > CO2 > N2, whereas carbon stability presented an opposite order. Our results contributed to selecting the appropriate atmosphere to optimize the properties and performances of biochars.
