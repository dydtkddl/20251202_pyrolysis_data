Anion-exchange behaviour of metals on deae-cellulose in hydrochloric acid—acetic acid media The anion-exchange behaviour of 35 metal ion species on a weakly basic cellulosic ion-exchanger (DEAE-cellulose) in mixed hydrochloric acid—acetic acid media has been investigated. The sorption of metal chloro-complexes on DEAE-cellulose is greatly enhanced with increasing concentration of acetic acid. Differences in sorbability of metals allow many useful analytical separations to be conducted on short columns, containing ∼ 1 g of DEAE-cellulose(Cl−). Procedures for the chromatographic separations of two-, three-, four- and five-component mixtures are given.
