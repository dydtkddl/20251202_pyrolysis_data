You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Packed-bed pyrolysis of some leguminosae PODS – exothermicity magnitude and products Packed bed pyrolysis is carried out for a heating temperature of 575 K of pellets made by ten Leguminosae pods (peas, broad beans, cranberry and cannellini beans, peanuts, broom, tamarind, silver wattle, acacia, and carob). Except for some tree pods (carob, silver wattle, acacia), remarkable exothermicity is displayed with temperature overshoots approximately between 50–130 K. Based on thermogravimetric curves, it can be stated that high alkali contents (low peak rate temperatures) promote exothermic decomposition. Instead, negative factors are high contents of low molecular weight carbohydrates to the detriment of cellulose (low peak rates). The yields of charred solid are in the range 36-62 wt%. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant gaseous product, followed by smaller yields of carbon monoxide. The pyrolysis liquids mainly consist of acetic acid, hydroxy propanone, methyl alcohol, furfural, furfuryl alcohol and, in some cases, toluene. In general, the pyrolysis characteristics are quantitatively similar for pods belonging to the same botanical family, with a few exceptions caused by peculiar chemical compositions such as in the case of carob pods.
