You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of waste polystyrene into transportation fuel: Effect of contamination on oil yield and production at pilot scale This study investigated the pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) packaging waste for transportation fuel application of the oil product, with a specific focus on the effect of contamination and the scale-up of the process. The oil yield and calorific value were optimised at bench scale in a semi-batch reactor with temperature and heating rate as input factors. The process was then scaled up to a semi-continuous rotary kiln reactor and the oil product was characterised in terms of fuel properties. Oil yields of 89.8–93.2 wt% with higher heating values (HHV) of 42.1 ± 0.5 MJ/kg were achieved at bench scale with virgin PS. Heavy meat juice contamination (15.9 wt% dry contamination) decreased the oil yield by 6.4 wt%, but did not affect the HHV significantly. Due to more losses at pilot scale, a lower oil yield of 82.5 ± 1.4 wt% was achieved and the gross energy recovered in the oil was 88.0 ± 2.6%. Fuel characterisation indicated that the oil contained substantially less inorganic and sulphur than the waste feedstock. However, for commercial use, blending with conventional fuel would be necessary to mitigate the aromatic content of the oil.
