You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Organic template-free synthesis of fly ash-based ZSM-5 for economical closed-loop of hybrid plastics Multi-win strategy produces high-value chemicals from plastics through catalytic pyrolysis, alternative to the traditional petroleum route, which is of positive significance in realizing closed-loop recycling of plastics, white pollution control and low-carbon emission. Key work lies in the organic template-free synthesis of fly ash-based ZSM-5 (FAZ) zeolites for catalytic reforming process of mixed plastics. The zeolites were subjected to ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis with simulated mixed plastic particles (MPP) from municipal solid wastes, and the liquid yield of FAZ-2–48h was 42.7 wt%, which was 1.3 times that of commercial ZSM-5. The selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the reformulated oil was 84.3 %, and the C6-C12 distribution was 98.01 %. The synergistic reaction between hydrogen-rich polymers (LDPE, PP) and hydrogen-poor polymers (PS) in the ternary hybrid plastics promoted the formation of liquids. The liquid yield of FAZ zeolite for the catalytic reforming of the actual hybrid plastics was 24 wt%, with a MAHs selectivity of 86.5 %, and the percentage of C6-C12 was 99.7 %. The FAZ zeolite showed long-term stability in catalytic reforming experiments on mixed plastics, and the selectivity of MAHs was stabilized at 81 %, and this work provides an opportunity to realize high-value conversion and economic recycling of waste plastics.
