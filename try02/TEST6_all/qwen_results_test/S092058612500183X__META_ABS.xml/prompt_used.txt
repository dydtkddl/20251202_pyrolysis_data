You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coking-driven activation of NixFe3-xO4 doped waste-derived carbon: From methanol decomposition to enhanced alkaline OER catalysis Hydrogen production via methanol decomposition is a promising route for sustainable energy, but catalyst deactivation due to coking remains a major challenge. The issue is even more critical for low-cost catalysts, as their reuse or disposal poses environmental and economic concerns. In this study, activated carbon derived from industrial coal-tar pitch waste was modified through two different hydrazine-based thermal treatments, doped with 40 wt% NixFe3-xO4 spinels, and subjected to prolonged methanol decomposition to induce coking. All synthesized and spent catalysts were tested for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, the coked catalyst derived from low-temperature hydrazine treatment exhibited improved electrocatalytic performance compared to the parent materials, achieving considerably lower OER overpotentials due to an increased electrochemically active surface area and reduced charge transfer resistance. The carbon coking induced by the methanol decomposition was found to be beneficial for enhancing the overall electrochemical properties of the catalyst depending on their preparation procedure. These findings highlight a new strategy for repurposing spent catalysts in electrocatalytic applications, offering a sustainable approach to catalyst lifecycle management.
