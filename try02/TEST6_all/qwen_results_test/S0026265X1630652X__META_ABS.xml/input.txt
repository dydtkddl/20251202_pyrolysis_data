Application of the SARA method for determination of hydrocarbons by GC/qMS in bio-oil obtained by fast pyrolysis of rice husk This study presents the results of the use of fractionation preparative liquid chromatography (PLC) on columns of silica (based on the SARA method, traditionally used for oil samples).For characterization of bio-oils obtained by fast pyrolysis of rice husk. The method distributes compounds separating into four fractions, the majority polar compounds (F3 and F4) and hydrocarbons (F1 and F2). The fractions were analyzed by GC/MS allowing the identification and semi-quantitative determination of aliphatic hydrocarbons and HPAS. After the fractionation by PLC, only F1, F2 and F3 were possible to identify, a total of 180 compounds. The fractionation based on the SARA method, with modification, produced fractions (F1 and F2) free of polar compounds permitting the identification of aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAHs.
