Biochar-driven reduction of As(V) and Cr(VI): Effects of pyrolysis temperature and low-molecular-weight organic acids Batch experiments were conducted to examine the differential effects of biochar pyrolysis temperature and low-molecular-weight organic acids on the reduction of As(V) and Cr(VI) driven by Pennisetum hydridum biochar. The results showed that pyrolysis temperature significantly affected the reducing strength of the biochar. Biochar produced at 500 °C had a stronger electron-donating capacity than did the biochars produced at 300 and 700 °C. In the co-presence of the biochar and a low-molecular-weight organic acid, arsenic and chromium behaved differently. Oxalic acid and malic acid tended to have better effects on enhancing biochar-driven Cr(VI) reduction, as compared to citric acid while the opposite was observed for biochar-driven As(V) reduction. Biochar produced at 300 °C was more favourable for Cr(VI) reduction, as compared to the higher-temperature biochars while the opposite was observed for As(V) reduction in the presence of low-molecular-weight organic acids. This may make the lower-temperature biochar ideal for remediating contaminated soils containing both As(V) and Cr(VI) since it could maximize Cr(VI) reduction while minimizing As(V) reduction.
