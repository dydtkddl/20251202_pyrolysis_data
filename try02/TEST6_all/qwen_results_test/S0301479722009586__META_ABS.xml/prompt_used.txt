You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impacts of pyrolysis temperatures on physicochemical and structural properties of green waste derived biochars for adsorption of potentially toxic elements This study comparatively investigated the influence of changes in pyrolysis temperature on the physicochemical, structural, and adsorptive properties of biochars derived from a green waste (Cynodon dactylon L.). For this purpose, the biophysically dried green wastes were pyrolyzed at 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C under the same pyrolysis conditions. The results revealed that the physicochemical and structural properties were varied, depending upon the pyrolysis temperatures. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the surface functional groups were escaped, the structure became more porous (pore volume of 0.089 ± 0.001), the metal oxides were remained consistent, and the biochars turned into more alkaline nature (pH of 11.9 ± 0.2). Furthermore, as referring to the adsorptive performance for potentially toxic elements, with experimental adsorption capacity of up to 33.7 mg g−1 and removal rate up to 96% for a multi-metals containing solution, the biochars pyrolyzed at high temperature (800 °C) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those pyrolyzed at low temperature (400 °C). According to the physicochemical and structural properties, and the adsorptive performances of the biochars, the optimal pyrolysis temperature was herein recommended to be 800 °C.
