Production and biodegradability analysis of bael shell pyrolysis oil The bael shell (aegle marmelos) is used as the feedstock in this work to produce the pyrolysis oil, using a fixed bed reactor. The particle size of the biomass feedstock was taken in 0.5-1.0 mm. The pyrolysis oil was produced at the temperature of 430 °C, at the heating rate of 15 °C min-1. The operating pressure in the reactor was 0.5 MPa and the N2 was used as sweeping gas, at the flow rate of 50 ml min-1 intermittently.Two bacterial species viz.Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter sp., were usedto investigate the biodegradability of the pyrolysis oil. It was found that, these bacterial species could degrade 20.4% and 18.5% pyrolysis oil of bael shell post 96 hrs of inoculation respectively.
