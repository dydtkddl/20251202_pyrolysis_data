ACFs-NH2 developed for dispersive solid phase extraction combined with Py-GC/MS for nanoplastic analysis in ambient water samples Accurate determination of nanoplastics (NPs) in aquatic ecosystems constitutes a challenge for which highly sensitive analytical methods are necessitated. Herein, a sample pretreatment based on self-made amino-functionalized activated carbon fibers (ACFs-NH2) dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) allows for high-recovery, followed by high-sensitivity detection of NPs by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The developed methodology allowed low detection limits (20–100 μg/L) to be achieved quickly in a few steps. Under optimal conditions, ACFs-NH2 (12.5 mg) was able to recover ≥98.45 % of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics at high concentration (100 mg/L) in 10 mL seawater. Based on the high adsorption performance of materials, the adsorption dynamics and isotherms were determined to infer the interaction mechanism of PSNPs on ACFs-NH2. After adsorption, the target on the surface of the adsorbent can be directly pyrolyzed, which can simplify the operation steps and avoid the elution of organic solvents, making the process more environmentally friendly. This strategy is feasible for the analysis of trace NPs in water systems.
