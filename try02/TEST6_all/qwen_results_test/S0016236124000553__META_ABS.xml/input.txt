An experimental investigation in a CI engine for the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of liquid fuel produced through catalytic co-pyrolysis The current study deals with blending pure diesel with the liquid fuel (PB1) obtained through the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Azadirachta indica seeds and waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) as the catalyst. The maximum yield of liquid oil was obtained at 500 °C at 93.91 % while at this temperature, the yield of gases and char were observed to be the lowest compared to other temperatures. The obtained liquid oil was then characterised through FTIR and physical properties were determined for the obtained fuel and it was found that PB1 contained a higher calorific value of 44.42 MJ/kg, quite close to pure diesel. Three blends were prepared with D100 (pure diesel), namely PB1@10 (with 10 % blend), PB1@20 (with 20 % blend) and PB1@30 (30 % blend). The blends were then tested in an unmodified CI engine for a comparative analysis with respect to baseline fuel (D100). BTE for PB1@20 was found to be 28.69 % at the highest load, maximum among blends and close enough to D100. BSFC was almost the same at 0.3 kg/kWh with PB1@20 and PB1@30 as that of D100 while the NOx formation decreased by 3.5 % at higher loads for PB1@30. The smoke formation also decreased for all blends at the higher loads, 43 % at 60 % load and 19.6 % at 80 % load, while the lambda factor also decreased substantially compared to D100 to be close to 1 at higher loads. The maximum cylinder pressure and maximum heat release during combustion also increased by approximately 1 % for PB1@20 and PB1@30 while PB1@10 remained quite close to D100. PB1@20 and PB1@30 were also found to have more heat release than D100, confirming a proper combustion with similar pattern as that of D100. The investigation revealed that the obtained renewable liquid oil from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Azadirachta indica seeds and waste LDPE using AL2O3 catalyst could be a potent fuel to be utilized at high blends with pure diesel.
