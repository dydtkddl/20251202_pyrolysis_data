Structural and mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites Recently, polymer nanocomposites reinforced with lower volume fraction of nanoceramics and carbon nanotubes have attracted steadily growing interest due to their peculiar and fascinating properties as well as their unique applications in commercial sectors. The incorporation of nanoceramics such as layered silicate clays, calcium carbonate or silica nanoparticles arranged on the nanometer scale with a high aspect ratio and/or an extremely large surface area into polymers improves their mechanical performances significantly. The properties of nanocomposites depend greatly on the chemistry of polymer matrices, nature of nanofillers, and the way in which they are prepared. The uniform dispersion of nanofillers in the polymer matrices is a general prerequisite for achieving desired mechanical and physical characteristics. In this review article, current development on the processing, structure, and mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites reinforced with respective layered silicates, ceramic nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes will be addressed. Particular attention is paid on the structure–property relationship of such novel high-performance polymer nanocomposites.
