You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review on biomass chemical looping combustion: Feedstock type, operating conditions, reactor design, technological advancement, mechanistic insights, and economics Chemical-looping combustion has appeared as an encouraging technology to generate electricity with intrinsic CO2 capture. Utilizing biomass material in the CLC can benefit sustainable energy development and negative carbon emissions. Biomass CLC often includes diverse feedstocks, operating conditions, and multiple reactor designs, which can affect the combustion efficiency and performance of the CLC system. This review aims to critically discuss biomass CLC with the combustion of different feedstocks in the fuel reactor (FR), oxygen carriers (OCs) performance, reactor design, operating conditions, process economics, and environmental impact. The biomass CLC was also compared with conventional combustion technique. The biomass feedstocks mostly produced syngas along with 100 % CO2 capture in the CLC process. However, the reactivity and stability of OCs and operational difficulties need to be addressed for diverse biomass feed. The three reactor configurations including air reactor (AR), FR, and steam reactor remained attractive among twin reactor (AR and FR) and fluidized bed systems because of their enhanced combustion efficiency and power output. The FR temperature and pressure between 850 – 950 °C and 0.5 – 2.4 MPa, respectively, can result in enhanced carbon conversion (84.7 %), CO2 recovery (97.2 %), combustion efficiency (95.5 %), and 50 kWth power output. The Ni-based OCs indicated stability (i.e., no agglomeration and carbon deposits) and morphology beyond 900 °C with 99 % combustion efficiency, while Fe-based OC showed high-quality hydrogen in syngas at 950 °C. Further, the molecular simulations revealed changes in the crystal structures of OCs due to the reduction and oxidation steps of the CLC. For instance, the lattice oxygen of CuO OCs was utilized to activate biomass C – H bond and transferred to char to generate CO2. Moreover, technological advancement in biomass CLC covered OCs development, multi-fuel burning compatibility, and novel reactors. The economics of biomass CLC relied on integrating it with hydrogen production, using cheap feedstock, employing natural OCs, specialized reactor design, equipment depreciation, and environmentally friendly process.
