You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synchronous solid-state diffusion, dissolution-reprecipitation, and recrystallization leading to isotopic resetting: insights from chalcopyrite replacement by copper sulfides Reactions among minerals occur via solid-state diffusion or fluid-induced, interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation (ICDR). Both mechanisms can coexist under conditions where the rates of both processes are similar, depending mainly on the nature of the mineral, temperature, and fluid composition. To clarify the synergies between these reaction mechanisms, we investigated the replacement and recrystallization reactions of chalcopyrite in the presence of a 65Cu-enriched aqueous fluid. The replacement of chalcopyrite by secondary copper sulfides follows a paragenetic sequence, whereby chalcopyrite is initially replaced by covellite, and then by digenite, with some of the digenite replacing covellite in longer duration experiments. The replacement reactions proceed via ICDR along with solid-state diffusion of 65Cu from the fluid into product minerals, with both mechanisms occurring at similar rates. Over time, chalcopyrite is completely replaced, and the secondary copper sulfides attain isotopic equilibrium with the fluid. Depending on temperature, thermal history, and fluid-mineral ratio, the reaction products may preserve kinetic or equilibrium signatures. We have identified a new geochemical process of ‘porosity-aided recrystallization’, which may result in a re-equilibration or perturbation of mineral isotopic/trace element compositions due to exchanges between the mineral and fluid facilitated by extensive micro- to nano-scale porosity created by ICDR reactions. Porosity-aided recrystallization will affect any mineral-fluid system where mass transfers via solid-state diffusion and ICDR operate at similar rates, causing rapid (days-weeks) ‘resetting’ of the original isotopic abundances and trace element contents of the affected minerals. In copper sulfides, porosity-aided recrystallization occurs at lower temperatures (<300 °C) due to fast cation diffusion rates (log10D ≈ –13.6, 300 °C), but also takes place across other mineral systems where diffusion rates are faster at high temperatures. The open-system isotopic and trace element exchanges associated with porosity-aided recrystallization could lead to erroneous petrological interpretations, especially where these markers are used as a proxy for reconstructing geological evolution.
