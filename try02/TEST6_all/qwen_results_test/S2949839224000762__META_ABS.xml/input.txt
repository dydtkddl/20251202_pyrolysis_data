Abundance and seasonal variation of microplastics in the effluents of a wastewater treatment plant: A case study in Greece Microplastics (MPs) have been detected in numerous ecosystems worldwide. To better understand their distribution and establish a foundation for risk assessment protocols, detailed information on MP concentrations and polymer compositions is essential. This study assessed the presence and chemical composition of MPs, ranging from 5 mm to 125 µm, in the effluents of a Greek wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) over a one-year period to understand the temporal variation in MP input into the receiving water fidentification and mass data were obtained through pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis. The study found that fibers (50–78 %) were the predominant form of MPs compared to particles, with the most common size range being 125–200 μm for fibers and 200–2000 μm for particles. Py-GC/MS analysis indicated a clear dominance of polyolefins among the polymers analyzed, with MP mass concentrations ranging from 4.5 to 69.29 μg/L. Increased concentrations of MP items and mass were observed following rainfall events (due to elevated discharge and altered hydraulic parameters) and during windy conditions. This underscores the need for improved assessment of background parameters in future MP monitoring strategies. By providing data on MP input in WWTP effluents over a one-year period, this study enhances our understanding of seasonal MP dynamics and can serve as a crucial reference for future measurements.
