You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Abundance and seasonal variation of microplastics in the effluents of a wastewater treatment plant: A case study in Greece Microplastics (MPs) have been detected in numerous ecosystems worldwide. To better understand their distribution and establish a foundation for risk assessment protocols, detailed information on MP concentrations and polymer compositions is essential. This study assessed the presence and chemical composition of MPs, ranging from 5 mm to 125 µm, in the effluents of a Greek wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) over a one-year period to understand the temporal variation in MP input into the receiving water fidentification and mass data were obtained through pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis. The study found that fibers (50–78 %) were the predominant form of MPs compared to particles, with the most common size range being 125–200 μm for fibers and 200–2000 μm for particles. Py-GC/MS analysis indicated a clear dominance of polyolefins among the polymers analyzed, with MP mass concentrations ranging from 4.5 to 69.29 μg/L. Increased concentrations of MP items and mass were observed following rainfall events (due to elevated discharge and altered hydraulic parameters) and during windy conditions. This underscores the need for improved assessment of background parameters in future MP monitoring strategies. By providing data on MP input in WWTP effluents over a one-year period, this study enhances our understanding of seasonal MP dynamics and can serve as a crucial reference for future measurements.
