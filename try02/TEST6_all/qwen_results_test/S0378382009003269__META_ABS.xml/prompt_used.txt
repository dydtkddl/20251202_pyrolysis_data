You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimum operating conditions for a two-stage gasification process fueled by polypropylene by means of continuous reactor over ruthenium catalyst We studied fuel gas production by means of pyrolysis and steam reforming of waste plastics for applications in solid oxide fuel cells. More specifically, we evaluated the effects of pyrolytic gasification temperature, catalyst content, steam reforming temperature, and weight hourly space velocity for a Ru catalyst used in a 60gh−1-scale continuous experimental apparatus, which consisted of a tank reactor for pyrolysis and a packed-bed catalytic reactor for steam reforming. Polypropylene (PP) pellets were used as a model waste plastic. Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with two different Ru contents were investigated. To suppress residue formation, the optimum operating temperature of the pyrolyzer was 673K. To ensure suppressed coke formation, sufficient carbon conversion to gaseous products, and minimized heat loss from the reactor, the optimum operating conditions for the reformer were determined to be 903K and 0.11g-sample g-catalyst−1 h−1 with a 5wt.% Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The composition of the gas produced with the 5wt.% catalyst was almost the same as that predicted by chemical equilibrium laws, and it was applicable for a direct hydrocarbon fuel cell.
