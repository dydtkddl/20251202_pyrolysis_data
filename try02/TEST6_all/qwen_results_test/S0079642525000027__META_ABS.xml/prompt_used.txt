You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D-Printed photocatalysts for revolutionizing catalytic conversion of solar to chemical energy Conversion of solar to chemical energy is essential for addressing energy crisis and mitigating environmental problems by generating storable, valuable chemicals. Photocatalysts play a critical role in solar conversion systems by affecting solar energy capture, charge generation and transfer, and redox reaction rates; however, they still face significant challenges in practical manufacturing. As an advanced manufacturing technology, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the creation of complex and customizable catalytic material structures with precise control, surface area optimization, catalytic sites majorization, and the integration of multiple materials to enhance the photocatalytic process. This review begins by examining the fundamental principles of 3D-printed photocatalysts for solar to chemical energy conversion, with a focus on metal oxides/chalcogenides, carbon-based materials, metal organic frameworks/covalent organic frameworks and their composites. Second, the key performance parameters, emerging challenges and opportunities in designing 3D-printed photocatalysts were discussed. Third, the latest advancements on 3D-printed photocatalysts are presented across various applications (water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, pollutant degradation, and organic synthesis), covering material design, synthesis methods, and the relationship between structure and photocatalytic performance. Finally, the review outlines future directions for integrating 3D printing with photocatalysis. This comprehensive review aims to provide insights for designing high-performance photocatalysts for sustainable energy supply.
