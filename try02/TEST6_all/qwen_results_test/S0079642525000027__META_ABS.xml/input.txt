3D-Printed photocatalysts for revolutionizing catalytic conversion of solar to chemical energy Conversion of solar to chemical energy is essential for addressing energy crisis and mitigating environmental problems by generating storable, valuable chemicals. Photocatalysts play a critical role in solar conversion systems by affecting solar energy capture, charge generation and transfer, and redox reaction rates; however, they still face significant challenges in practical manufacturing. As an advanced manufacturing technology, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the creation of complex and customizable catalytic material structures with precise control, surface area optimization, catalytic sites majorization, and the integration of multiple materials to enhance the photocatalytic process. This review begins by examining the fundamental principles of 3D-printed photocatalysts for solar to chemical energy conversion, with a focus on metal oxides/chalcogenides, carbon-based materials, metal organic frameworks/covalent organic frameworks and their composites. Second, the key performance parameters, emerging challenges and opportunities in designing 3D-printed photocatalysts were discussed. Third, the latest advancements on 3D-printed photocatalysts are presented across various applications (water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, pollutant degradation, and organic synthesis), covering material design, synthesis methods, and the relationship between structure and photocatalytic performance. Finally, the review outlines future directions for integrating 3D printing with photocatalysis. This comprehensive review aims to provide insights for designing high-performance photocatalysts for sustainable energy supply.
