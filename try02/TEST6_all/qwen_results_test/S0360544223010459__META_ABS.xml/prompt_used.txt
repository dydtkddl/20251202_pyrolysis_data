You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-stage thermochemical conversion of polyethylene terephthalate using steam to produce a clean and H2- and CO-rich syngas This study deals with thermochemical conversion of polyethylene terephthalate using steam and a two-stage process having fluidized bed packed bed reactors. In the study, the temperatures of the fluidized bed reactor and packed reactor were varied in the range of 600–800 and 700−800 °C, respectively. In the experiments, active carbon used as a tar removal additive sharply increased the yields of syngas, char, H2, and CO and decreased the condensed tar yield. Although toluene, styrene, naphthalene, biphenyl, and anthracene were found in the syngas obtained without active carbon, none were found in the experiment with active carbon. The tar content in the gas with active carbon was 13 mg/Nm3. A high tar-cracking reactor temperature and a high steam/fuel ratio favored the production of syngas and H2. In the present study, the highest H2 yield was 93 g/kg-feed, the highest H2 content in syngas was 53 vol%, and the CO yield was 418 g/kg-feed. Also, a long-term thermochemical conversion of PET was explored for 4 h, and there were no operational problems during the experiment. In the long-term operation, tar appeared only after 2 h reaction time, and anthracene appeared only in the gas sample drawn after 4 h reaction time.
