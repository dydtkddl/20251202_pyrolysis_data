You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Controlling coke deactivation and cracking selectivity of MFI zeolite by H3PO4 or KOH modification The effect of the basic (KOH) or acid (H3PO4) treatment of the MFI (HZSM-5) zeolite has been studied comparing the structural and acidic features with the catalytic performance and deactivation of a set of unmodified and modified zeolites (SiO2/Al2O3 =30–280, 0–3wt% of K or P). The properties of the catalysts have been elucidated using XRD, 27Al and 29Si NMR, N2 adsorption–desorption, and adsorption-TPD of tert-butylamine. The catalytic performance has been evaluated in the cracking of 1-butene by means of initial, 5h on-stream activity and coke formation. Our results point to the fact that using zeolites with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio or neutralizing the strongest acid sites with KOH or H3PO4 increases propylene selectivity while decreases 1-butene conversion. The overall pathway of reaction involves propylene and other olefins as primary products that condensate in further steps to aromatics and ultimately to coke. This pathway can be controlled with less severe acidic features and by desilication with KOH or H3PO4 (particularly with the former).
