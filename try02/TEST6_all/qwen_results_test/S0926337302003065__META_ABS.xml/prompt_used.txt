You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of Sb2O3 in brominated heating impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) on thermal degradation and debromination by iron oxide carbon composite catalyst (Fe-C) The iron oxide carbon composite catalyst (Fe-C) was prepared and used for catalytic debromination process during pyrolysis of heating impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) with various brominated flame retardants at 430°C into fuel oil. The effect of antimony oxide (Sb2O3: synergist) in HIPS-Br containing decabromo diphenyl oxide (DDO) and decabromo diphenyl ethane (DDE) as flame retardant was investigated. The thermal degradation of HIPS-Br produced various brominated hydrocarbons and also hydrobromic acid (HBr) in addition to various hydrocarbons. The synergist (Sb2O3) reacted with the hydrogen bromide evolved during the pyrolysis process and formed the SbBr3 in the liquid products. The presence of bromine content (organic and inorganic) in liquid products is not desirable to use as a fuel oil. The use of iron oxide carbon composite catalyst (Fe-C) during pyrolysis debrominated (ca. 99%) the bromine compounds from liquid products. The presence of Sb2O3 (5wt.%) decreased both the hydrogen bromide and brominated hydrocarbons by forming SbBr3 and produced high quantity of lower hydrocarbons (C7C11). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the presence of Sb2O3 in HIPS-Br decreased the degradation temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction results showed the presence of Fe3O4 phase in fresh Fe-C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) shows the presence of Sb and Br in used Fe-C catalyst in the degradation process.
