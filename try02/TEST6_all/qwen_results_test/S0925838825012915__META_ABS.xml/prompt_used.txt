You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive assessment of laser powder bed fusion and post-treatments for microstructure and mechanical properties of GH3230 alloy GH3230 is a solid solution-strengthened material based on a W-Cr-Mo matrix that has been extensively employed in critical hot-end components of aerospace engines. This study offers a comprehensive evaluation of the GH3230 superalloy fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology, focusing on the optimization of processing parameters, investigating potential cracking mechanisms, and analyzing the microstructural evolution and variations in mechanical properties by post-treatment (solution treatment and hot isostatic pressing). The optimal processing parameters was determined through the application of response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) principles, supported by variance analysis. Under the optimized process parameters (laser power = 250 W, scanning speed = 1040 mm/s, and hatch spacing = 0.06 mm), the alloy is fabricated with a relative density (RD) of 99.62 % ± 0.04 %. The evaluation of crack sensitivity, based on thermodynamic calculations, indicated that the GH3230 alloy exhibits a high sensitivity to cracking. The analysis of grain boundary (GB) orientation revealed that over 80 % of the cracks occurred at GB angles within the range of 25° to 55°, which are classified as crack-sensitive high-angle grain boundaries. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between crack length and GB misorientation angle. Due to the combined effects of microstructure and defects, the compressive strength of the solution-treated state (3062 MPa) and the hot isostatic pressing state (3196 MPa) is lower than that of the as-printed state (3308 MPa). This study provides valuable insights into the LPBF processing of the GH3230 superalloy, establishing a solid theoretical and experimental foundation for future advancements in this field.
