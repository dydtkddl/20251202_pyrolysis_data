Exploring the integrated potential of pyrolysis and low-temperature wet torrefaction for typical medical waste valorization: A multifaceted approach leveraging online TG-FTIR-MS, 2D-COS, iso-conversional kinetics, and reaction mechanisms The rapid growth of medical waste, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and advancements in healthcare, has drawn increased public scrutiny regarding its proper disposal and treatment. This research aimed to characterize the wet torrefaction of a typical medical waste biomass (MWB) composition, comprising bamboo swabs, skewers, splints, cotton balls, tongue depressors, toothpicks, and chopsticks, followed by its co-pyrolysis with medical waste plastic (MWP) including catheter bags, drapes, IV tubing, IV bags, oxygen masks, syringes, and test tubes. The study employed thermogravimetric analysis, TG-FTIR, 2D correlation spectroscopy, iso-conversional kinetics, and mass spectrometry techniques elucidated the driving factors, behaviors, products, mechanisms, and pathways involved. The pyrolysis temperature ranges were 180.15 to 400 °C for TMWB and 380.04 to 550 °C for MWP, with average activation energies of 150.22 and 221.59 kJ/mol for their respective devolatilization processes. Incorporating 20 % and 40 % MWP into the co-pyrolysis process yielded the best performance, characterized by the lowest activation energy. The co-pyrolysis process promoted the release of cyclic hydrocarbons and chain hydrocarbons, but decreased the yields of alcohols, esters, ethers, phenols, and acids, through synergistic mechanisms. Unraveling the pyrolysis pathways and dynamics of these representative medical waste streams offers valuable insights into improving energy recovery, mitigating pollution, diminishing waste volumes, and optimizing industrial thermochemical conversion processes for safely treating these hazardous materials.
