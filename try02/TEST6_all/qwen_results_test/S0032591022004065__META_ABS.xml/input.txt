Particle attrition and heat transfer problems in fluidized processing of ferrous industry with design implications Fluidization engineering and technology are widely used in metallurgical industries, particularly ferrous metal industry, due to its advantages. However, such fluidized processing suffers from problems such as particle attrition and heat transfer. The influence of these problems could be serious in fluidized system design and operation. This paper reviews briefly the fluidized processing in various stages of ferrous industry. The review focuses, in detail, on particle attrition and heat transfer problems. The link between the two problems and their interaction are considered. It is important to consider the general design aspects of fluidized bed systems with a focus on distributor design. Despite the size of deleterious attrition problem, the studies on the problem are notably limited particularly at high temperature reaction conditions. Particle attrition is beneficial to heat transfer. The heat transfer system coupled with high temperature reaction conditions are deleterious to the attrition process. Attrition control favors process economics.
