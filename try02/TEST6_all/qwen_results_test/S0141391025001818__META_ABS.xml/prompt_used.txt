You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemical degradation strategies for polystyrene microplastic: Current trends and future prospects Polystyrene (PS) microplastic (MP) pollution is a major environmental issue due to its extensive use, persistence, toxicity and resistance to degradation. In aquatic ecosystems, PS-MP disrupt biodiversity, accumulate in marine organisms, and transport toxic pollutants, ultimately entering the food chain and posing serious ecological and health risks. Conventional removal methods, including filtration, flotation, coagulation, adsorption, and bioremediation, often struggle with inefficiencies, high costs, and secondary pollution. Likewise, degradation techniques such as biodegradation, photocatalysis, and thermal or chemical treatments face challenges related to effectiveness, prolonged treatment durations, and sustainability. Electro-oxidation (EO) has emerged as an efficient and advanced approach for PS-MP breakdown, leveraging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to achieve high removal rates with minimal environmental impact. This review explores recent progress in electrochemical degradation, emphasizing reactor design, electrode materials, operating conditions, mass transfer, mixing strategies, and temperature control. Additionally, degradation pathways and economic feasibility are critically examined. This study systematically evaluates EO performance, with removal efficiencies ranging from 28 % to 90 % over treatment durations of 3 to 72 h. PS-MP sizes between 0.1 and 149 µm and concentrations from 10 to 2000 mg/L were assessed. Notably, the BDD anode with 0.03 M Na₂SO₄ as the electrolyte demonstrated superior efficiency, reinforcing its effectiveness in MP degradation. Key challenges and future research directions are discussed to improve EO's practical application. By addressing existing gaps and limitations, this review contributes to the development of sustainable solutions for mitigating PS-MP pollution and safeguarding aquatic ecosystems.
