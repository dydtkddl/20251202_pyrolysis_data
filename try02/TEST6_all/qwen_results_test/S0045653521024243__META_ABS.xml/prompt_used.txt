You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of drug losartan in environmental aquatic matrices by heat-activated persulfate: Kinetics, transformation products and synergistic effects In this study, the oxidative degradation of losartan (LOS), a widely administered medicine for high blood pressure by heat-activated persulfate was investigated. Increased temperature and persulfate concentration, as well as acidic conditions enhance the degradation efficiency of LOS, whose rate follows pseudo-first order kinetics. From the respective apparent rate constants in the range 40–60 °C, an apparent activation energy of 112.70 kJ/mol was computed. Radical scavenging tests demonstrated that both HO• and S O 4 • − contribute towards LOS degradation. LOS degradation was suppressed in real water matrices including bottled water (BW) and secondary wastewater effluent (WW), while other experiments indicated that the presence of bicarbonates and humic acid negatively affected its oxidation. Instead, the addition of chloride ions at 250 mg/L resulted in a positive effect on LOS removal. The combination of heat-activated PS with low-frequency ultrasound exhibited a synergistic effect, with the ratio S being 2.29 in BW and 1.52 in WW. Five transformation products of LOS were identified through HRMS suspect and non-target screening approaches, among which two are reported for the first time. Using the in-house risk assessment program, ToxTrAMs was revealed that most of the identified TPs present higher toxicity than LOS against Daphnia magna.
