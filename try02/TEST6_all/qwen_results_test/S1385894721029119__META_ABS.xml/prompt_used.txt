You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics and applications of micro fluidized beds (MFBs) Fluidized beds (FBs) are commonly employed by many practical applications, and continuous optimization of FBs is necessary to improve their application performance. However, it is uneconomical and impractical to conduct the parametric investigation and kinetic studies based on a large-scale FB. Accordingly, the micro fluidized beds (MFBs), with excellent mass/heat transfer and sufficient mixing between phases, serve as the suitable platform for understanding the reaction behaviors and extracting kinetics on a laboratory scale. In this review, a global view of the properties of the whole MFBs family (including gas–solid, liquid–solid and gas–liquid–solid MFBs) are comprehensively presented. The differences and correlations of hydrodynamics (e.g. enhanced wall effect) between MFBs and full-scale FBs are discussed, and modified correlations for predicting the minimum fluidization velocity (umf ) and hydrodynamic features (e.g. flow regimes and residence time) of MFBs are summarized. Additionally, the application of MFBs in the areas of kinetic studies, rapid reactions and pharmaceutical engineering are also discussed. Finally, the parameter correlation between MFBs and full-scale FBs is discussed critically, and scaling up/scaling out strategies for guiding the design of industrial FBs are proposed. The conclusions of this review serve the purpose of a bridge to link the findings from lab-scale MFBs with the design and optimization of industrial FB reactors.
