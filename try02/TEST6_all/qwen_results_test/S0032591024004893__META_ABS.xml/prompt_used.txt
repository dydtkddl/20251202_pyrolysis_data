You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The behaviour of plastic particles during pyrolysis in bubbling fluidized bed reactors: Incipient agglomeration and axial segregation Plastic-fluidized bed interaction has been investigated by non-invasive X-ray imaging techniques in the temperature range of 500–650 °C and under pyrolysis conditions. Experiments were conducted by feeding a single polypropylene particle using either overbed or underbed feeding methods. The fluidized bed was operated from minimum fluidization conditions to bubbling regime, up to 2Umf. Interestingly, experimental observations show that the understanding of the mixing/segregation behaviour of polypropylene in a hot fluidized bed does not appear to be as straightforward as in the case of more conventional feedstocks, such as biomass. Further analysis and an alternative point of view to investigate the complex behaviour observed for plastic feedstock have been provided. The interaction between the fluidized bed and a single polypropylene particle was modelled by means of an axial segregation model, and a physics-assisted stochastic approach. In the second case, it was possible to simulate the formation of the sand-plastic agglomerate (incipient agglomeration stage) and the evolution of its density over time. The models were then validated by means of axial segregation data obtained via X-ray imaging techniques and by measuring the physical properties of real sand-polypropylene agglomerates produced within the bed operating at high temperatures. Results obtained in this study show that the unpredictable sinking-floating behaviour of the plastic particles is not related to the change in density associated to the formation of the sand-polypropylene agglomerates over time.
