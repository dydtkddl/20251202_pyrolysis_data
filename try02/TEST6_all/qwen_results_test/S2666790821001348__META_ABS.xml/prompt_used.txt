You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of palm shell pyrolysis parameters in helical screw fluidized bed reactor: Effect of particle size, pyrolysis time and vapor residence time The production of bio-oil from palm shell pyrolysis was investigated using a helical screw fluidized bed reactor setup. This study was done by investigating the effects of particle size, pyrolysis time and vapor residence time on pyrolysis product yields. The pyrolysis experiments were performed at different particle sizes, pyrolysis times and vapor residence times from 0.25 mm to 10 mm; 20 min to 60 min and 0.25 s to 15 s, respectively. The optimum condition for PS pyrolysis in helical screw fluidized bed reactor is at 2 mm particle size, 30 min pyrolysis time and 0.25 s vapor residence time to produce PS derived bio-oil of the highest yield of 73.86 wt% and higher heating value of 43.14 MJ/kg. Here, we report of the capability of helical screw fluidized bed reactor in handling large biomass particle size ranging up to 10 mm with marginal deteriorations of less than 1% and 3% for bio-oil yield and higher heating value respectively. This feature was attributed to the screw propeller design system in helical screw fluidized bed reactor which provided high mass and heat transfer at large particle size range which is 5 times of the particle size limit as recommended in previous studies. This finding would enable the possibility of helical screw fluidized based pyrolysis to be done in the absence of biomass size reduction processes to reduce process cost and complexity.
