You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study on intercalation-exfoliation and thermal activation modified kaolin for heavy metals immobilization during high-organic solid waste pyrolysis With the new municipal solid waste classification policy implemented in China, attention on achieving the waste-to-energy disposal of “dry waste” has been growing. Pyrolysis conversion of organic waste into value-added chemicals is a promising method to treat solid waste. However, after removing the non-combustible components of “dry waste”, the obtained high-organic solid waste (HSW) contains various heavy metals, which requires urgent attention during thermochemical conversion. To mitigate heavy metals risk, kaolin was employed as additive during HSW pyrolysis, and intercalation–exfoliation and thermal activation modifications were performed on the kaolin to further immobilize and stabilize heavy metals in the derived chars. The characterization results illustrated that the interlayer spacing, pore volume and diameter of kaolin were expanded after intercalation–exfoliation modification, providing more opportunities for the adsorption of metals. The thermal activation method favored the transformation of kaolin into metakaolin via dehydroxylation to enhance its nonhexacoordinated Al proportion and chemisorption. During 450–650 °C, kaolin exhibited an effective solid enrichment performance for targeting heavy metals, and the intercalation–exfoliation and thermal activation modification further enhanced the adsorption capacity of the kaolin for Cd, Cr, Pb and Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, respectively. Compared with Cu and Zn, additives demonstrated better stabilization effects for Cd, Pb, and Cr, transforming more bioavailable fractions to the residual speciation. Overall, a higher pyrolytic temperature (650 °C) and the addition of effective additives could simultaneously increase the residual fraction and decrease the bioavailable fraction of heavy metals in HSW-derived chars, reducing the potential ecological risk.
