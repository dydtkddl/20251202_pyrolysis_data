You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis volatiles over Y zeolites modified with different metal oxides Pyrolysis as one of the most utilizations of biomass has aroused the increasing attention, however, the key is to upgrade biomass pyrolysis volatiles and enrich the high-valued chemicals in bio-oil. In this paper, different metal oxide-modified Y zeolites, including Fe/Y, Co/Y, Ni/Y, Mg/Y and Zn/Y, were prepared by wet impregnation and employed in catalytic upgrading of pyrolytic volatiles from rice straw (RS) and poplar sawdust (PS). Results showed that the modification by metal oxides led to the decrease of surface area and the changes in the acidity of zeolites. Higher yields of gas and water were obtained over metal oxide-modified zeolites at the expense of the bio-oil yields. More strong acid sites of the Ni/Y and Zn/Y catalysts promoted the generation of H2. Fe/Y catalyst showed good selectivity to aromatics in bio-oil owing to high mesoporous volume and strong deoxidization capacity. The highest aromatic hydrocarbons content (63.0%) was obtained over Fe/Y in RS bio-oil. The formation of phenol and cresol was promoted with increasing the ratio of Lewis/Brönsted acid. Under the action of Ni/Y with the highest Lewis/Brönsted ratio, the phenol content in bio-oil from RS and PS pyrolysis was enhanced to 11.8% and 25.3%, respectively. The Fe/Y catalyst had good upgrading performance during three reaction-regeneration cycles. In addition, the possible reaction mechanism of biomass pyrolysis volatiles over metal oxide-modified Y zeolites was proposed. This work will provide a guide for the composition regulation of bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis.
