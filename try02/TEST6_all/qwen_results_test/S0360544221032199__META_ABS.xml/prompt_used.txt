You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Monolithic biochar-supported cobalt-based catalysts with high-activity and superior-stability for biomass tar reforming In this paper, monolithic biochar-supported cobalt-based catalysts with unique long and through mesopores were synthesized based on the biological channels of biomass materials through simple impregnation and carbonization. Toluene steam reforming and biomass pyrolysis tar decomposition experiments were performed to evaluate the activity and stability of these monolithic catalysts. Regular channels with a diameter of around 20–40 μ m are well retained after carbonization. Co, Co–Fe and Co–Ni alloy nanoparticles are formed and dispersed uniformly on the surface of the channels of the catalyst, which are anchored firmly by graphitic carbon layer. At 700 °C, the carbon deposition resistance of PC@CoFe and PC@CoNi was significantly improved due to the introduction of the Fe and Ni, and excellent performance was achieved during the 360 min continuous toluene reforming experiments. The average toluene reforming rate reached around 97% and 85.3% by using PC@CoNi and PC@CoFe as the catalysts, and H2 and CO were the main product with a small amount of CO2 and CH4. PC@CoNi also showed high activity in the decomposition of biomass pyrolysis tar with a high average tar conversion efficiency of around 91% and excellent stability in a five-cycle test, and H2 yield was also significantly improved.
