Monolithic biochar-supported cobalt-based catalysts with high-activity and superior-stability for biomass tar reforming In this paper, monolithic biochar-supported cobalt-based catalysts with unique long and through mesopores were synthesized based on the biological channels of biomass materials through simple impregnation and carbonization. Toluene steam reforming and biomass pyrolysis tar decomposition experiments were performed to evaluate the activity and stability of these monolithic catalysts. Regular channels with a diameter of around 20–40 μ m are well retained after carbonization. Co, Co–Fe and Co–Ni alloy nanoparticles are formed and dispersed uniformly on the surface of the channels of the catalyst, which are anchored firmly by graphitic carbon layer. At 700 °C, the carbon deposition resistance of PC@CoFe and PC@CoNi was significantly improved due to the introduction of the Fe and Ni, and excellent performance was achieved during the 360 min continuous toluene reforming experiments. The average toluene reforming rate reached around 97% and 85.3% by using PC@CoNi and PC@CoFe as the catalysts, and H2 and CO were the main product with a small amount of CO2 and CH4. PC@CoNi also showed high activity in the decomposition of biomass pyrolysis tar with a high average tar conversion efficiency of around 91% and excellent stability in a five-cycle test, and H2 yield was also significantly improved.
