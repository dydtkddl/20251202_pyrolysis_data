You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective oxidative upcycling of PET plastic waste into aniline and terephthalic acid using nitrobenzene Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with an annual global production exceeding 80 million tons, is the most widely used polyester but poses a severe environmental challenge due to its resistance to degradation and low recycling rates. Upcycling waste PET into valuable chemicals is essential for achieving sustainable resource utilization and mitigating the environmental impact of plastic pollution. Herein, we report an oxidative strategy for converting waste PET into aniline and terephthalic acid (TPA) using nitrobenzene over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst. Complete PET conversion was achieved, with aniline yields reaching 94 % and TPA yields reaching 99 % at 220 °C for 10 h. The high efficiency stems from strong Ru-TiO2 interaction that facilitate electron transfer from the support to Ru, thus boosting the dehydrogenation of the ethylene glycol unit—the rate-limiting step. Controlled hydrogen release ensures high selectivity for aniline, while the water-based reaction medium enables energy-efficient product separation. Life cycle assessment highlights the environmental benefits of our process compared to traditional recycling and incineration methods, with reduced non-renewable energy use and global warming potential. Techno-economic analysis further demonstrates the industrial promises of this approach, projecting an annual profit of $36.13 million at an cannual treatment of 100,000 tons waste PET chips. This study presents a new strategy for the selective upcycling of PET into high-value chemicals, offering a promising solution to the challenges of waste PET management.
