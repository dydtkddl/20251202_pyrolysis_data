Microwave pyrolysis in phenolic-rich bio-oil production: A review of its process, statistical approach in experiment design and techno-economic viability The growing demand for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel-based chemicals has intensified interest in bio-based phenol production. Microwave pyrolysis (MP) presents a promising thermochemical conversion method for generating phenolic-rich bio-oils from biomass, offering advantages such as rapid heating, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced selectivity. This review systematically examines MP for phenolic bio-oil production, focusing on process optimization, statistical methodologies, and techno-economic feasibility. Key factors influencing bio-oil yield and phenol selectivity include feedstock composition, catalyst type, microwave absorbers, and operating conditions. Studies have demonstrated that MP can achieve phenol selectivity as high as 99.02 % (area) using phosphoric acid-treated activated carbon catalysts. Bio-oil yields have been optimized to reach up to 74 wt% with an appropriate catalyst-to-biomass ratio and microwave power settings. Statistical techniques such as response surface methodology, central composite design, and analysis of variance have been widely employed to optimize MP parameters and reduce experimental costs. Despite its potential, large-scale industrial applications of MP remain limited due to high initial investment costs and challenges in feedstock suitability. Techno-economic analysis suggests that integrating MP into circular economy strategies could enhance commercial viability by valorizing agricultural and industrial biomass waste. Economic studies estimate a minimum fuel sale price (MFSP) of $2.31‧L−1 for bio-oil, with a payback period of 1.9 years in solar-powered MP systems. Future research should focus on scalable MP technologies, catalyst reusability, and process automation to maximize sustainability benefits. This study underscores MP’s role in cleaner production by reducing dependency on fossil-based phenol while advancing bio-based chemical production.
