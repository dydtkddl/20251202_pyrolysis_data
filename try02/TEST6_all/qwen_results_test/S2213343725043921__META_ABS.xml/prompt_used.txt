You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave pyrolysis in phenolic-rich bio-oil production: A review of its process, statistical approach in experiment design and techno-economic viability The growing demand for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel-based chemicals has intensified interest in bio-based phenol production. Microwave pyrolysis (MP) presents a promising thermochemical conversion method for generating phenolic-rich bio-oils from biomass, offering advantages such as rapid heating, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced selectivity. This review systematically examines MP for phenolic bio-oil production, focusing on process optimization, statistical methodologies, and techno-economic feasibility. Key factors influencing bio-oil yield and phenol selectivity include feedstock composition, catalyst type, microwave absorbers, and operating conditions. Studies have demonstrated that MP can achieve phenol selectivity as high as 99.02 % (area) using phosphoric acid-treated activated carbon catalysts. Bio-oil yields have been optimized to reach up to 74 wt% with an appropriate catalyst-to-biomass ratio and microwave power settings. Statistical techniques such as response surface methodology, central composite design, and analysis of variance have been widely employed to optimize MP parameters and reduce experimental costs. Despite its potential, large-scale industrial applications of MP remain limited due to high initial investment costs and challenges in feedstock suitability. Techno-economic analysis suggests that integrating MP into circular economy strategies could enhance commercial viability by valorizing agricultural and industrial biomass waste. Economic studies estimate a minimum fuel sale price (MFSP) of $2.31‧L−1 for bio-oil, with a payback period of 1.9 years in solar-powered MP systems. Future research should focus on scalable MP technologies, catalyst reusability, and process automation to maximize sustainability benefits. This study underscores MP’s role in cleaner production by reducing dependency on fossil-based phenol while advancing bio-based chemical production.
