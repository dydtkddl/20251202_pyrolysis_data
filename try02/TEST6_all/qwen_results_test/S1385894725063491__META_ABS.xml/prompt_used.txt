You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards circular plastics: chemical recycling of high-density polyethylene-rich municipal waste using hydrothermal liquefaction Plastic waste presents significant environmental challenges, driving research into chemical recycling. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is particularly difficult to recycle among common plastics due to its stability. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology has emerged as a promising method to address these issues. This study applies HTL to convert post-consumer plastic waste, predominantly HDPE (93 wt%), into oil, gas, and char. The process achieved high oil yields (68–87 wt%), with limited gas (10–30 wt%) and minimal char (2–3 wt%). The oil properties were found to be adjustable based on reaction parameters: lower temperatures (430 °C) and shorter reaction times (1 min) produced heavier oils with a high saturated alkanes content, whereas higher temperatures (460 °C) and extended reaction times (60 min) yielded lighter oils with an increased aromatics content. Additionally, a higher water-to-plastic ratio favored alkenes production, resulting in a heavier oil with a limited aromatics fraction. This research illustrates the strong potential of HTL to transform real post-consumer plastic waste streams into new plastic monomers, thereby closing the loop in the chemical recycling of polyolefins and fostering an innovative approach for urban-industrial symbiosis and a circular economy.
