You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polymer-derived Ni/SiOC materials structured by vat-based photopolymerization with catalytic activity in CO2 methanation A new concept for the additive manufacturing of nickel-modified polymer-derived ceramics via vat-based photopolymerization is presented. A photoactive polysiloxane resin system modified by nickel nitrate via methacrylic acid complexation was developed and modified to facilitate vat-based photopolymerization. Through pyrolysis of the Ni-modified preceramic polymer at temperatures between 600 and 800 °C, amorphous SiOC components with well-dispersed Ni nanoparticles can be obtained. The modified polymer and the fabricated structures were characterized by photorheology, thermal analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, optical coherence tomography, and powder X-ray diffraction. In addition, the effect of pyrolysis temperature on specific surface area, crystallinity, and shrinkage was investigated. The developed material systems enable additive manufacturing of porous SiOC structures containing crystalline, uniformly distributed, and bimodally sized Ni nanoparticles, exhibiting catalytic activity suitable for CO2 methanation. The developed printable SiOC/Ni materials represent a promising approach for combining metal-modified polymer-derived ceramic systems and additive manufacturing for prospective catalysis applications.
