You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste corn stover and high-density polyethylene for hydrocarbon production: The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 zeolite In this work, acid-washing corn stover (ACS) impregnated with various concentrations of potassium was co-pyrolyzed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fixed bed reactor. The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 zeolite on product yields and mono-aromatic selectivity was studied. As the concentration of potassium increased, a reduction in liquid and an increase in gas and char yields were observed in both catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis. Potassium enhanced alkenes production with a maximum value of 54.2 % obtained from 0.8 wt%K-ACS/HDPE, indicating that potassium dispersed in char exerted catalytic effect on promoting the degradation of HDPE. Compared to ACS/HDPE, the catalytic co-pyrolysis of K-ACS/HDPE over HZSM-5 produced higher yield of mono-aromatics in the range of 77.3–82.5 % due to the fact that potassium optimized the co-pyrolysis intermediates diffused into HZSM-5 zeolite. The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 also favored the selectivity of toluene and xylene while suppressed the selectivity of alkylnaphthalene. The ICP-MS result showed that only a trace amount of potassium was deposited on the HZSM-5 zeolite during the ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis process. The BET surface area and acidity of spent HZSM-5 zeolites increased and the coke amount decreased with the potassium concentration, indicating that potassium alleviated the deactivation of HZSM-5 zeolite by changing the yield and distribution of co-pyrolysis intermediates.
