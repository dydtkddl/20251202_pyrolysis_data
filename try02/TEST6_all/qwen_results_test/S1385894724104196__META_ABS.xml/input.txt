Process electrification by magnetic heating of catalyst Electrification of the chemical and energy sector is a crucial step in the transition towards a carbon neutral society. Electrocatalysis is one way to selectively steer a reaction towards the desired products which relies on the electric field effects instead of temperature, but there is another way to solely heat the reaction site. Magnetic or induction heating of magnetic nanoparticles embedded within the catalyst can selectively heat the catalyst at the reaction site. Furthermore, such rapid and selective heating enables a construction of decentralised, intermediate-scale, adaptable, containerised and responsive units, capable of flexible operation as per the Europen Union’s new industrial paradigm. The possibly to utilize intermittent renewable energy and to operate reactors in highly dynamically responsive manner leads to energy efficiency, safer operation, reduced energy costs in downstream processing, keeping bulk fluid cold(er) compared to the catalyst grain to mention a few advantages. Recently, this concept has been successfully applied and reported but only in a relatively limited number of studies, which are reported and thoroughly reviewed in this work. This review aims to highlight and critically evaluate recent developments of magnetic materials used in magnetically heated catalysis and represent their magnetic and chemical properties in combination with an overview of reported chemical conversions. It can serve as guide to select optimal magnetic material for a targeted chemical conversion, highlighting (also schematically) their potential and restriction of use.
