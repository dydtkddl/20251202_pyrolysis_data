Recent advances in carbon composite films for high-performance, multifunctional and intelligent electromagnetic interference shielding and electromagnetic wave absorption With the widespread application of electronic communication technology, electromagnetic radiation pollution has become an increasingly serious problem in modern society, which promotes the rapid development of efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing materials. Carbon composite films with the advantages of high conductivity, light weight, large specific surface area, easy preparation have emerged as promising candidates for EMI shielding and/or EMW absorption. This article first introduces the key concepts, loss mechanisms, and evaluation methods of EMI shielding and EMW absorption, and then summarizes the common structural characteristics and preparation methods of current carbon composite EMI shielding/EMW absorbing films. Afterwards, the latest research on multifunctional and intelligent carbon composite EMI shielding/EMW absorbing films are reviewed. Finally, the technical issues and development trends of carbon composite EMI shielding/EMW absorbing films are prospected.
