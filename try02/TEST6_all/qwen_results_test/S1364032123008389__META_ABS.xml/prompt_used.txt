You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Literature quest and survey on graphite beneficiation through flotation Graphite is a promising and futuristic mineral that is envisaged to cause not only technological shift but also cultural shift in the days to come. Besides several applications, it is considered one of the critical raw materials for electric vehicle battery that has accelerated recent surge in the demand. However, the beneficiation of graphite ore is pivotal as it accounts for the quality, market price and suitability for various technological applications including energy storage in lithium-ion batteries. Since graphite is spontaneously hydrophobic (like coal) in nature, flotation is the common and apt technique for beneficiation of graphite ore. In this study, the research and development on the graphite beneficiation techniques especially flotation reported by several learned research groups in the world has been discussed and presented. The study provides updated insights on the state of the art and helps to understand the gaps which needs to be addressed to devise improved flotation methodology. The extent to which suitability of some orthodox coal flotation techniques towards graphite beneficiation also come to the fore. Based on several significant reported beneficiation methods, a master flow sheet for graphite beneficiation has been developed and presented that comprises various modules capable of dealing with wide range of graphite ores. The significance of this study is not only limited to the critical discussions pertaining to the preliminary and necessary flotation step of graphite ore but also speaks about the world-wide preparedness and prescribes opportunity to join the mission mode programme of energy storage.
