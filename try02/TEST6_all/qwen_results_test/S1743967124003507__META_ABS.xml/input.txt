Boosting light olefin production from pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene: A two-stage catalytic process The increasing production of waste plastics poses significant environmental and health risks. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a major component of plastic waste, is a high-quality feedstock for pyrolysis due to its high carbon and hydrogen content. Traditional pyrolysis methods, such as thermal cracking and one-step catalytic pyrolysis, have limitations in yield and selectivity of valuable products like light olefins. This study introduces a two-stage catalytic pyrolysis (TSCP) process aimed at enhancing the production of light olefins from LDPE. In the first stage, LDPE undergoes pyrolysis with MCM-41 catalyst, yielding a substantial number of liquid products and a minor portion of light olefins. The second stage utilizes Mg-ZSM-5 catalyst to further crack the high-temperature volatile matter into light olefins. The optimal conditions identified were 450 °C in the first stage and 500 °C in the second stage, achieving a maximum light olefin yield of 45.80 wt% and a low reaction temperature, decreasing the energy consumption. Additionally, the MCM-41 catalyst demonstrates excellent regeneration performance, with only a slight decrease in liquid yield after nine cycles. The Mg-ZSM-5 catalyst maintains high stability, with light olefin yield remaining at 83.60 % of the initial yield after 48 h of operation.
