You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study on the porosity development for biomass based carbonaceous materials This study deals with the structural and morphological changes occurring during pyrolysis and activation steps for the production of porous carbons from an arid-land plant Euphorbia rigida. A fixed-bed retort was used for slow pyrolysis and for further activation processes. Effect of pyrolysis atmosphere was examined at 550 °C and char yields were calculated to be 22.6, 23.1 and 17.5% under static, nitrogen and steam atmospheres respectively. Solid product obtained under static atmosphere was then impregnated with different chemicals (HCl, KOH, K2CO3, H2SO4, H3PO4, NaOH, ZnCl2) and a second thermal treatment was applied under different activation atmospheres. It was observed that the impregnation material, impregnation ratio and activation technique showed a strong influence on the yield and porous texture of the resulting carbons. On the basis of BET surface areas, most effective chemical agent was selected as K2CO3 giving a specific surface area of 1079 m2/g and microspore volume of 0.443 cm3/g. The physical–chemical properties of the chars and activated carbons were investigated by proximate and ultimate analyses, FT-IR, SEM, EDX, XRD and iodine number. In addition, surface functional groups were classified by Boehm titration method. Results suggest that chemical activation of E. rigida char produces valuable activated carbons under proper conditions.
