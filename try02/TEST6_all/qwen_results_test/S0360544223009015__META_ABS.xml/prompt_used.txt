You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dynamics and products of potato crop residue conversion under a pyrolytic runaway regime - Influences of feedstock variability Potato, ranked third among food crops, gives rise to huge amounts of plant residues largely unutilized owing to the presence of toxic compounds. The fundamentals of the pyrolytic runaway of these residues are investigated for a packed bed heated at a temperature of 570 K. The feedstock variability (five samples of different harvest year and cultivar), corresponding to variable average plant ageing, causes remarkable differences in the characteristic times (values between 6 and 42 s), heating rates (maxima between 5 and 155 K/s) and temperature overshoots (maxima between 220 and 410 K) of the runaway. On the other hand, the total gas and char yields are approximately the same (60–63 wt%), in consequence of the always fast and severe self-heating, also leading to evenly distributed and intense melting phenomena. The very high potassium contents (about 5–8 wt%) and a cellular structure with low porosity are the chief properties responsible for the significant exothermicity, resulting in intrinsically fast, in-situ catalyzed pyrolysis. The enhancement in the thermal severity of the pyrolytic runaway with longer plant ageing can be attributed to higher cellulose/starch contents, producing larger amounts of more reactive vapors, and thicker stem walls, confirming the key role of secondary reactions for the process.
