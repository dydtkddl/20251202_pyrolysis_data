You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect and implication of impurities on the calcination of α spodumene for lithium extraction A suite of spodumene samples from albite-spodumene type pegmatites, mined for their lithium content, in the Archaean North Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons regions of Western Australia, were examined to assess the influence of trace element impurities in spodumene and associated gangue phases on the thermal transformation of spodumene. Calcination of spodumene is required to convert the natural, monoclinic α-spodumene form into the tetragonal β-spodumene form, which is more amenable to recovering lithium during hydrometallurgy processing. Spodumene contains minor concentrations of Fe (500–10,000 mg/kg), Mn (200–1400 mg/kg) and other trace element impurities incorporated within the crystal structure. Primary gangue mineralogy comprises quartz, Na/K-feldspar and mica, with secondary alteration predominantly as ‘sericitic’ phyllosilicates (muscovite-lepidolite, chlorite/cookeite mixtures) variably enriched in Fe, Mn, Mg and K relative to spodumene. Primary and secondary mica undergo thermal dehydroxylation at temperatures ( ∼ 0.5 wt%) showed black, open sintered regions, accompanied by the generation of fine (<5 μm) particles, and exsolution of Fe/Mn-oxides particles. The sintering and the generation of fines in the calciner will lead to reduced lithium recovery from calcined products. This study illustrates the importance of minimising micaceous and feldspar components in the concentrate during the beneficiation stage, which can potentially lead to a decrease in lithium recovery during the extraction process. However, the fine-integrated nature of micas associated with spodumene alteration and those associated with fine fractures within spodumene are unlikely to be liberated without costly fine grinding and cleaning processes before the calcination process. Alternative calcination processes that target reducing the effect of gangue materials on clinker formation and encapsulation of spodumene particles are available and discussed.
