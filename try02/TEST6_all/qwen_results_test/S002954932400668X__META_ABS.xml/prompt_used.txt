You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Operation experience of a high-temperature fluoride salt test facility (FLUSTFA): Issues identified and paths forward Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactors (FHRs) are promising Generation IV nuclear reactors, with a passive decay heat removal system serving as one of their key design features. A high-temperature FLUoride Salt Test FAcility (FLUSTFA) was designed and constructed to perform both integral-effect tests, such as validating the design of a scaled-down passive decay heat removal system, and separate-effect tests, including evaluating the thermal–hydraulic performance of compact heat exchangers. FLUSTFA utilizes FLiNaK (LiF-NaF-KF: 46.5–11.5–42 mol%) as the working fluid and operates up to 700 °C near the atmospheric pressure. It is comprised of a reservoir tank for melting and storing the salt, a primary molten salt loop that simulates the reactor primary coolant system, a secondary molten salt loop that represents the passive decay heat removal system, an air loop, and a chilled water loop, all of which are thermally coupled via heat exchangers. Several shakedown tests were carried out using high-temperature nitrogen and FLiNaK salt as the working fluid. A few issues were identified during initial operation of FLUSTFA at 550–600 °C, such as hydrogen fluoride generation and leakage, localized hot spots where excessive heat loss occurs, molten salt pump malfunctions, abnormal readings from ultrasonic flow meters, and blockage of salt charging and recycling lines. In addressing all these issues, paths forward have been successfully identified and implemented. The lessons learned are valuable in improving future design and construction of high-temperature molten salt systems for molten salt reactors, fusion reactors, and next-generation concentrated solar power plants.
