You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of TiC content on microstructure and mechanical properties of nickel-based hastelloy X nanocomposites manufactured by selective laser melting The nickel-based Hastelloy X (HX) superalloy is widely applied in the aerospace industry because of its exceptional oxidation resistance and various beneficial properties at high temperatures. HX-based nanocomposites manufactured by additive-manufacturing processes based on powder-bed fusion, such as selective laser melting (SLM), are expected to further enhance the material's mechanical and thermophysical performance. This paper systematically studies the effects of TiC nanoparticle content on the microstructure and tensile performance of SLM-fabricated HX nanocomposites. The results reveal that the microcracking that formed in pure HX was successfully eliminated in the fabricated nanocomposites when 1 wt% and 3 wt% TiC nanoparticles were introduced. The fabricated HX-3 wt.% (HX-3) TiC nanocomposite showed several TiC clusters and a much higher pore-volume percentage (0.15%) compared to the HX-1 wt.% (HX-1) TiC nanocomposite, in which this percentage was determined to be 0.026%. Compared to SLM-fabricated pure HX alloy, the HX-1 nanocomposite exhibited over 19% and 10% improvements in ultimate tensile strength and elongation to failure, respectively. A further increase in TiC content to 3 wt% was not found to further enhance the tensile strength but did result in a 10% loss in elongation to failure in HX-3 nanocomposite. These findings offer a promising pathway to employ SLM to manufacture both high-strength and high-ductility materials through the careful selection of nanoparticle materials and their content.
