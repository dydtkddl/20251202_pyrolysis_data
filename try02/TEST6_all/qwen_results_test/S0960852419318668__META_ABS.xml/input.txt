Catalytic co-pyrolysis behaviors, product characteristics and kinetics of rural solid waste and chlorella vulgaris Catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics and products distribution of rural solid waste (RSW) and chlorella vulgaris (CV) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and fixed bed reactor. TGA results showed that co-pyrolysis of RSW and CV presented synergism by decreasing the temperature relating to the first mass loss peak. All the additives reduced residual mass for co-pyrolysis (5.21%, 1.57% and 4.89% for CaO, MgO and HZSM-5). Addition of CaO increased activation energy while HZSM-5 and MgO reduced it. Co-pyrolysis of RSW and CV remarkably reduced carboxylic acids and nitrogenous compounds especially for 1:1 ratio. (30.85% and 25.87%). Catalytic pyrolysis with CaO showed the best results by increasing aliphatic hydrocarbons especially light fraction (5.96%–11.98%), reducing acids (0%–30.85%) and nitrogenous compounds (0.08%–17.26%), causing higher HHV of oil. Overall, catalytic co-pyrolysis of CV and RSW with CaO could obtain bio-oil of higher quality.
