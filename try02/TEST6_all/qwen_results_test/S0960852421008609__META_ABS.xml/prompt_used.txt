You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coconut-shell-derived bio-based carbon enhanced microbial electrolysis cells for upgrading anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and aloe peel waste Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and exogenous accelerants can augment anaerobic digestion performance. Herein, MECs and coconut-shell-derived bio-based carbon (CBC) accelerant are adopted to strengthen anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and aloe peel waste. The MEC with the voltage of 0.6 V and CBC accelerant of 0.15 wt.% gained the highest cumulative biogas yield (444.20 NmL/g VS) and chemical oxygen demand removal rate (75.46%), which are 80.25% and 58.33% higher than those (246.44 NmL/g VS, 47.66%) of the blank group, respectively. The digestates embodied a utilization potential with thermogravimetric loss of 37.12%–50.67% and total nutrient content of 35.36–51.58 g/kg. These results benefited from excellent electrocatalytic activity of MECs and physicochemical properties of CBC accelerant. A general strategy for understanding improved methanogenesis was proposed based on integrated effects of MECs and CBC accelerant. This work will shed light on development of anaerobic co-digestion by combining MECs and bio-based carbon accelerants.
