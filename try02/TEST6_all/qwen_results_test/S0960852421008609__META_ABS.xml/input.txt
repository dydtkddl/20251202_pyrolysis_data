Coconut-shell-derived bio-based carbon enhanced microbial electrolysis cells for upgrading anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and aloe peel waste Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and exogenous accelerants can augment anaerobic digestion performance. Herein, MECs and coconut-shell-derived bio-based carbon (CBC) accelerant are adopted to strengthen anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and aloe peel waste. The MEC with the voltage of 0.6 V and CBC accelerant of 0.15 wt.% gained the highest cumulative biogas yield (444.20 NmL/g VS) and chemical oxygen demand removal rate (75.46%), which are 80.25% and 58.33% higher than those (246.44 NmL/g VS, 47.66%) of the blank group, respectively. The digestates embodied a utilization potential with thermogravimetric loss of 37.12%–50.67% and total nutrient content of 35.36–51.58 g/kg. These results benefited from excellent electrocatalytic activity of MECs and physicochemical properties of CBC accelerant. A general strategy for understanding improved methanogenesis was proposed based on integrated effects of MECs and CBC accelerant. This work will shed light on development of anaerobic co-digestion by combining MECs and bio-based carbon accelerants.
