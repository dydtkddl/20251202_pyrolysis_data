You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into dechlorination of pyrolysis oil during fast co-pyrolysis of high-alkali coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Thermal treatment can utilize polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in a high-value, eco-friendly method, but HCl generation and high oil chlorine content are key pyrolysis issues. Therefore, this research extensively characterized fast co-pyrolysis of PVC and high-alkali coal (HAC) using XPS, TG-FTIR-GC/MS, and GC-MS. This explored alkali metal catalysis and volatile reforming effects on Cl transfer and utilizing PVC as a hydrogen donor to improve the quality of pyrolysis oil. According to the GC-MS results, increasing the PVC ratio to 40 % raised monocyclic (MAHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to 59.1 % and 33.4 % respectively. However, co-pyrolysis of PVC and HAC inhibited the polyene reconstruction of the carbon skeleton, leading to a decrease of oxygenates, such as phenolic, acid, and ester. The XPS results showed that the inorganic chlorine in the solid product increased from 1 % to 66 % after co-pyrolysis at 600 °C, indicating the high fixed chlorine effect of HAC. Fast heating almost merges the PVC dechlorination stage with the conjugated polyene reconstruction stage, creating a liquid–gas synergy. Abundant coal α-carbon selectively binds with H+, dechlorinated PVC, and polyene fragments, rather than binding with Cl-. This study provides valuable insights into coal-PVC interactions and the dechlorination of pyrolysis oil during fast co-pyrolysis processes and advances the sustainable management of PVC waste.
