You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of photo-oxidation on the performance and soil degradation of oxo- and biodegradable polymer-based items for agricultural applications The examination of the aging behavior of polymers, blends, composites, items, etc. under different environmental conditions is a priority issue for assessing the possible applications and establishing the lifetime. In agriculture, plastic items (mulch films, irrigation tubes, etc.) are widely used and subjected to solar UV exposure that can induce photo-oxidation on macromolecular chains. Therefore, weathering under outdoor conditions and accelerated degradation tests are performed for simulating aging processes during the lifetime of materials and select appropriate stabilizers to be used. In the last decades, oxo- and biodegradable polymers have been investigated and used in agricultural items. The influence of photooxidation or outdoor weathering on their structures, performance and biodegradation behavior in soil has been evaluated. This review aims to provide an overview of the studies focused on the effects of photo-degradation processes on chemical-physical properties and degradation in soil of oxo- and biodegradable polymers or items designed for agricultural purpose, including an outline of the available standards. Additionally, a comparison between the behaviors induced by photo-oxidation of the two different families of degradable polymers used in agricultural plastic items is carried out.
