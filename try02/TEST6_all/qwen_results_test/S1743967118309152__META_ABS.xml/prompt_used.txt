You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of fast and slow pyrolysis on the degradation of mixed plastic waste: Product yield analysis and their characterization This work primarily investigated the pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed plastic wastes during slow pyrolysis (non-isothermal) in a batch reactor to assess the effect of different heating rates on the product yield and its composition. The effect of residence time during fast pyrolysis (Isothermal) in Pyro-GC was also investigated. Initially, TG analysis was performed to investigate the degradation temperature range at different heating rates of 5, 10, 20 and 40 °C/min. Two different heating rates of 10 and 20 °C/min were selected for examining the effect on products such as oil and gases (H2, CO, CO2 and C1-C6 hydrocarbons) during slow pyrolysis. The oil obtained at higher heating rate had higher density (0.743 kg/m3) while the amount of residue decreased with the increase in heating rate. Also, the effect of residence time during fast pyrolysis was investigated using Pyro-GC at 500 °C for the product formation. It was observed that an optimum residence time of 10sec was favourable for the higher production of lower hydrocarbons (C1-C3) and less production of heavier hydrocarbons (C6). This work represents the combined analysis of fast and slow pyrolysis and their impact on the product yield. Also, the effect of heating rate on non-isothermal condition and the effect of the residence time of volatiles in isothermal condition was analysed and reported.
