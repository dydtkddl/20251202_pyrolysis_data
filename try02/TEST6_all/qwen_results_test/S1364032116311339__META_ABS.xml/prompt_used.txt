You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bioethanol production from renewable sources: Current perspectives and technological progress Bioethanol is an attractive biofuel having potential for energy security and environmental safety over fossil fuels. To date, numerous biomass resources have been investigated for bioethanol production, which can broadly be classified into sugars, starch and lignocellulosic biomass. However, conversion of biomass into ethanol varies considerably depending on the nature of feedstock, primarily due to the variation in biochemical composition, and so, only a few feedstocks have been exploited commercially. In recent years, the conversion process of biomass has been improved significantly, even though most of these achievements are yet to be implemented in commercial facility. All the major steps in a typical conversion process, particularly fermentation of sugars that is the common step for all biomass, are greatly influenced by microorganisms. A traditional yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a bacterial species, Zymomonas mobilis, are widely used in the ethanol fermentation technology. Many factors affect ethanol production process, and the final yield is directly associated with the optimum conditions of these attributes. This review paper presents an overview on the first and second generation bioethanol production with a particular attention to the potential of various biomass sources, technological approaches, role of microorganisms and factors affecting ethanol production process.
