You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The fate of fuel-nitrogen during gasification of biomass in a pressurised fluidised bed gasifier The distribution of fuel-nitrogen in gases, tar and char from gasification of biomass in a pressurised fluidised bed gasifier was investigated. Four species of biomass: birch, Salix, Miscanthus and Reed canary grass were gasified at 0.4MPa and 900°C. Oxygen-enriched nitrogen was used as fluidising agent. As a reference, gasification of Daw Mill coal was also carried out under the same experimental conditions. The experimental results illustrate that both the nature of the original fuels and the chemical structure of the nitrogen in the fuel have influence on the distribution of fuel-nitrogen in gases (NH3, HCN, NO), tar and char under the employed experimental conditions. The present work also shows that the types of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds (NHCs) in the tar from different kinds of biomass are the same and the major compound is pyridine. However, the distribution of the various NHCs in the tar from the four species of biomass varies: the higher the content of fuel-nitrogen, the higher the concentration of two-ring NHCs in the tar. An effective method for extracting NHCs from the acidic absorption of the product gas was introduced in the present work. The method makes use of solid phase extraction (SPE) by a silica-based C18 tube to extract the NHCs which subsequently were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionisation detection (FID). The recovery and reproducibility of the SPE technique for NHCs is discussed.
