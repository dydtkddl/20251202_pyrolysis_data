You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the Role of Acid Sites in the Hydrocracking of Polyethylene-EVOH Multilayer Film Waste over Pt/BEA Catalyst Multilayer polymer films (MFs) containing poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH) and polyolefins are ubiquitous in single-use food and medical packaging. MFs are currently landfilled or incinerated rather than mechanically recycled because of the processing difficulties associated with their form factor and complex multicomponent structures. Advanced chemical recycling is a promising solution. Prior reports have explored hydrogenolysis and hydrodeoxygenation to convert EVOH, but these technologies are limited by catalyst deactivation and slow apparent kinetics, respectively. Alternatively, in this work, we demonstrate the efficient hydrocracking of commercial MFs into naphtha range (C5-C12) alkanes over platinum (Pt) supported on acidic zeolites. Mixtures of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and EVOH are utilized as MF surrogates to gain fundamental insights. Pt deposited on BEA supports with varying Lewis acid site (LAS) concentrations are synthesized and tested for hydrocracking. Surprisingly, Pt/BEA with high LAS concentrations demonstrates improved activity for LPDE/EVOH blends over LDPE alone. In contrast, LAS concentrations are shown to have no influence on LDPE hydrocracking. LAS and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) catalyze the dehydration of EVOH to form water, which improves LDPE hydrocracking. Polyaromatics formed primarily via EVOH thermal degradation lead to detrimental coke formation, which hinders hydrocracking activity. Reaction conditions and feed ratios of LDPE and EVOH are tuned to balance these competing effects. Reusability tests demonstrate that Pt/BEA maintains high activity (81% conversion in 2 h) and high selectivity towards naphtha (78%) over multiple reuse cycles. These findings position hydrocracking as a promising technology for the circularity of complex MF plastic waste.
