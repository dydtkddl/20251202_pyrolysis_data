Chemical recycling of plastics assisted by microwave multi-frequency heating Handling plastic waste through recycling allows extending the life of polymeric materials, avoiding recurrence to incineration or landfilling. In contrast with traditional mechanical recycling technologies, chemical recycling enables the obtention of the virgin monomers by means of depolymerisation to create new polymers with the same mechanical and thermal properties as the originals. Research presented in this paper is part of the polynSPIRE project (Horizon 2020 European funding programme) and develops and scales-up a heated reactor to carry out the depolymerisation of polyamide-6 (PA6), polyamide-6,6 (PA66) and polyurethane (PU) using microwave (MW) technology as the heating source. The purpose is to design and optimize a MW reactor using up to eight ports emitting electromagnetic waves. Finite element method (FEM) simulation and optimisation are used to design the reactor, considering as parameters the data obtained from experimental dielectric testing and lab-scale characterisation of the processes and materials studied. Two different COMSOL Multiphysics modules are involved in this work: Radio Frequency (RF) and Chemical Reaction Engineering (RE), to simulate the reactor cavity using two frequency levels (915 MHz and 2.45 GHz) with a power level of 46 kW, and the chemical depolymerisation process, respectively. A sensitivity study has been performed on key parameters such as the frequency, the number of ports, and position inside the reactor to consolidate the final design. It is expected that these results assist in the design and scale-up of microwave technology for the chemical recycling of plastics, and for the large-scale deployment of this sustainable recovery alternative.
