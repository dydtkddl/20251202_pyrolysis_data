You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of plastics assisted by microwave multi-frequency heating Handling plastic waste through recycling allows extending the life of polymeric materials, avoiding recurrence to incineration or landfilling. In contrast with traditional mechanical recycling technologies, chemical recycling enables the obtention of the virgin monomers by means of depolymerisation to create new polymers with the same mechanical and thermal properties as the originals. Research presented in this paper is part of the polynSPIRE project (Horizon 2020 European funding programme) and develops and scales-up a heated reactor to carry out the depolymerisation of polyamide-6 (PA6), polyamide-6,6 (PA66) and polyurethane (PU) using microwave (MW) technology as the heating source. The purpose is to design and optimize a MW reactor using up to eight ports emitting electromagnetic waves. Finite element method (FEM) simulation and optimisation are used to design the reactor, considering as parameters the data obtained from experimental dielectric testing and lab-scale characterisation of the processes and materials studied. Two different COMSOL Multiphysics modules are involved in this work: Radio Frequency (RF) and Chemical Reaction Engineering (RE), to simulate the reactor cavity using two frequency levels (915 MHz and 2.45 GHz) with a power level of 46 kW, and the chemical depolymerisation process, respectively. A sensitivity study has been performed on key parameters such as the frequency, the number of ports, and position inside the reactor to consolidate the final design. It is expected that these results assist in the design and scale-up of microwave technology for the chemical recycling of plastics, and for the large-scale deployment of this sustainable recovery alternative.
