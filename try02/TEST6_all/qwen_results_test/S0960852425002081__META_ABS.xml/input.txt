Reliable methodology to determine biotransformation of PBAT in anaerobic conditions Biodegradable plastics can enhance food waste utilization in anaerobic digestion (AD) units, but their fate under thermophilic conditions remains unclear. Previous studies using methane production, calorimetry, or spectroscopic analyses often report inconsistent results. This study tracks the biotransformation of polybutylene adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT) in thermophilic AD (55 °C) using 1H NMR to quantify monomers. While 1,4-butanediol degraded quickly, adipic (AA) and terephthalic acid (TPA) accumulated over time. Monomer analysis estimated PBAT biotransformation at 11.1 ± 1.9 % (TPA) and 10.1 ± 2.3 % (AA). The core microbial community remained stable, indicating intrinsic hydrolytic capacities, which were stable despite TPA and AA accumulation. This workflow provides a robust methodology to evaluate the biotransformation of plastics.
