You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding ceiling temperature as a predictive design parameter for circular polymers The rise of polymeric materials marks a notable achievement of the past century, yet challenges in recycling have led to their accumulation in various environments. Efforts to address this include advancements in mechanical recycling, degradation processes, and chemical recycling techniques, particularly chemical recycling to monomer, which offers a path toward a circular economy for plastics. In this perspective, we discuss how ceiling temperature (T c) can be used as a design parameter for circular (closed-loop recyclable) polymers and provide an overview of typical experimental approaches for deriving T c, focusing on ΔH p and ΔS p as the key parameters for prediction. The concept of T c is heavily embedded in the polymer literature and provides a simple but still useful way of quickly ranking different polymers in terms of their relative thermodynamic stability of polymer versus monomer states. While T c in the bulk state as an intrinsic value is a desirable quantity, it is infeasible in many cases to measure equilibrium states in the bulk; thus, many researchers have focused on investigating T c in solution, where there may be dependencies of T c on the solvent, concentration, or other factors, resulting in a family of apparent T c values at each set of conditions. We thus explore computational studies as a complement to experimental measurements of T c. To this end, we focus here on the advantages, obstacles, and outlook of the establishment of predictive computational approaches to calculate key thermodynamic parameters related to polymer circularity, namely ΔH p, ΔS p, ΔG p, and T c values.
