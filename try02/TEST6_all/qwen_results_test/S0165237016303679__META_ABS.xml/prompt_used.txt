You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of pyrolysis conditions on levoglucosan yield from cotton straw and optimization of levoglucosan extraction from bio-oil Fast pyrolysis of cotton straw was performed under different temperature ranges, particle sizes, holding times and acid concentrations in a fluidized bed reactor to maximize the yield of levoglucosan (LG). The maximum LG yield was obtained at the optimal pyrolytic conditions: temperature of 500°C, holding time of 1.4s, particle size of 600–650μm and acid concentration of 8%. Furthermore, an improved method to quickly and easily extract LG from bio-oil was developed by utilizing precipitation and Soxhlet extraction to quantitatively remove organic colloid, pigments and aromatic compounds with less loss of LG during extraction. The process was optimized by using Box-Behnken design for three reaction parameters: the volume of water (A), the quality of activiaed carbon (B), and pH (C). The extraction presented required no prolonged high heating (thus protecting the LG from hydrolysis), used benign reagents, and realized a significant purity over other methods. The purity and structure of LG were determined by busing chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, such as HPLC, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. The optimal extraction yield of LG from the straw bio-oil was 78% with the purity of 95.56%. This research also applied a new method to quickly determine the quantitative and qualitative analysis test parameters of LG.
