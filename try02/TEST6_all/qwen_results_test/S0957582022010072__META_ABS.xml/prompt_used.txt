You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of flash pyrolysis and combustion of biomass powders using the Godbert-Greenwald furnace: An essential step to better understand organic dust explosions An organic dust explosion is a heterogeneous system on a space and time scale. Predicting the parameters characteristic of its severity needs experimental and theoretical approaches to find the optimal compromise between consistency with reality and modelling time. A hybrid method is proposed to study flash pyrolysis and combustion of several organic powders (cellulose, wheat starch, oak wood, Douglas fir and olive pomace). A Godbert-Greenwald furnace was employed to perform the experiments to mimic the fundamental characteristics of a dust explosion: high particle heating rate, high reaction temperature and short residence times. At 973 K, the residence time is a critical parameter: the large particles of cellulosic compounds (wood, cellulose) do not reach their pyrolysis temperature and only fibres smaller than 20 or 30 µm are fully converted. As the particle size distribution of starch is smaller, heat transfer is not directly the limiting phenomenon but rather the strong tendency for powders to agglomerate during pyrolysis. At higher temperatures, secondary reactions of primary tars are evidenced, stressing the influence of the pyrolysis stage and leading to heterogeneous combustion. The composition of the pyrolysis gases as a function of the nature of the powder and the temperature was also determined. A lumped-kinetic model adapted to dust explosion was developed and validated for cellulose. The kinetics constants corresponding to levoglucosan to permanent gases and cellulose to char and water reactions are significantly different from those proposed by the literature, demonstrating that dust explosion kinetic parameters must be obtained under conditions consistent with such phenomenon.
