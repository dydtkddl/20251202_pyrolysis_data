You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An efficient relay catalysis system for upgrading waste polyethylene terephthalate plastics A relay catalysis system involving tandem hydrogenation of aromatic and ester groups is developed for upgrading alcoholized waste PET to the higher-value 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), offering a potential solution for a closed-loop plastic-to-plastic cycle. Physical mixtures of Pd/C and Cu-MnOx-ZrO2 catalysts, designed with lower acidity, are used to mitigate undesired hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) side reactions. A dual-temperature strategy, exploiting the distinct temperature sensitivities of Pd and Cu catalysts, is employed to minimize kinetic competition between the two hydrogenation reactions, thereby reducing side reactions caused by the presence of aromatic rings during tandem hydrogenation. The construction of a Cu-O-Mn interface, which enhances the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the Cu+/Cu0 ratio, favors the hydrogenation of ester groups. As a result, the relay catalysis system achieves an overall CHDM yield of 92.6 % in a kettle reactor from dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), and 85.7 % in a fixed-bed reactor system from PET.
