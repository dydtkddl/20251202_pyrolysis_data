An efficient relay catalysis system for upgrading waste polyethylene terephthalate plastics A relay catalysis system involving tandem hydrogenation of aromatic and ester groups is developed for upgrading alcoholized waste PET to the higher-value 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), offering a potential solution for a closed-loop plastic-to-plastic cycle. Physical mixtures of Pd/C and Cu-MnOx-ZrO2 catalysts, designed with lower acidity, are used to mitigate undesired hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) side reactions. A dual-temperature strategy, exploiting the distinct temperature sensitivities of Pd and Cu catalysts, is employed to minimize kinetic competition between the two hydrogenation reactions, thereby reducing side reactions caused by the presence of aromatic rings during tandem hydrogenation. The construction of a Cu-O-Mn interface, which enhances the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the Cu+/Cu0 ratio, favors the hydrogenation of ester groups. As a result, the relay catalysis system achieves an overall CHDM yield of 92.6 % in a kettle reactor from dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), and 85.7 % in a fixed-bed reactor system from PET.
