You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On-purpose production of propane fuel gas from the hydrothermal reactions of n-butanol over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst: A parametric and mechanistic study Production of components of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) from biomass can become a sustainable pathway towards the defossilisation of off-grid locations for heating and transport applications. The reactions of butanol in the presence of 5 wt% Pt/Al2O3 across a set of reaction temperatures (200 °C to 300 °C), reaction times (up to 2 h), n-butanol concentrations (up to 30 wt%) and various feedstock-to-catalyst mass ratios were investigated and optimised. High conversion of n-butanol to gas products (99.91 wt%), high yield of propane (63.56 wt%) and propane hydrocarbon selectivity of 88.87 % were achieved in a batch reactor after 2 h of reaction at 300 °C. The formation of propane appeared to be from several mechanisms including decarbonylation, dehydration, C–O and C–C hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation. Significant yields of hydrogen and butane were formed, which may support the complex mechanistic pathways involved in n-butanol conversion. The 5 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was stable for up to two reaction cycles under the conditions investigated before mainly deactivating via hydrolysis of the alumina support and coke formation. This present work shows that n-butanol is a potential bio-derived feedstock to produce on-purpose biopropane fuel gas via catalytic hydrothermal processing.
