You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar promotes the growth of apple seedlings by adsorbing phloridzin Apple replant disease (ARD) has been reported in all major apple-growing regions of the world, and abiotic (phenolic compounds including phloridzin) and biological (bacteria, fungi and nematode) factors are important causes of ARD. This study aimed to assess the effect of phloridzin adsorption on biochar pyrolyzed at different temperatures and the effectiveness of biochar addition on the growth of Malus hupehensis Rehd. seedlings under phloridzin stress. Three biochar treatments were considered (BC300, BC400 and BC500), pyrolyzed at three different temperatures (300°C, 400°C and 500°C, respectively). Batch adsorption experiments revealed that BC300 had the maximum adsorption efficiency. The BC300 treatment was then selected for isotherm and kinetic fitting to investigate the influence of pH on the adsorption process and determine the phloridzin adsorption mechanism. The biochar was found to have a single-layer phloridzin adsorption effect, and the adsorption rate was related to the biochar concentration and pyrolysis temperature. A outdoorpot experiment was conducted to analyze the biochar adorption to phloridzin in soil. Phloridzin addition significantly inhibited seedling growth and biochar significantly reduced the soil phloridzin content. BC300 had the best adsorption effect of the three biochar treatments. Compared with the replant soil (CK), biochar (especially BC300) increased the biomass of the seedlings and the antioxidant enzyme activity in the leaves. The soil enzyme activity, organic matter and bacteria numbers increased significantly after biochar addition. The best seedling growth and soil conditions were found for BC300. These results reveal that biochar addition can significantly reduce the phloridzin content and promote seedlings growth, and the effectiveness of the biochar depends on the pyrolysis temperature.
