You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential of palm kernel shell as activated carbon precursors through single stage activation technique for carbon dioxide adsorption The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in atmosphere brings in major concern nowadays. Accordingly, a study on the volumetric CO2 adsorption by using the palm kernel shell-based activated carbon synthesized via direct activation at 850 °C for 1 h has been investigated. The adsorbents are characterized using various analytical techniques to analyze the elemental, surface, and textural characteristics. Referring to the physiochemical analysis, it verifies that the proposed activation method effectively converts the palm kernel shell to value-added activated carbon material. The synthesized palm kernel shell-based activated carbon shows comparable CO2 adsorption capacity and CO2/nitrogen selectivity with the commercial grade activated carbon. The regeneration study that has been carried out via pressure swing indicates easy regenerability and good stability after the multiple adsorption-desorption cycles. The experimental CO2 adsorption isotherm data is examined by using several isotherm models – Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips, by using non-linear regression method. The findings reveal that the Sips model mathematically represents the CO2 adsorption, irrespective of adsorption temperature. Besides, heterogeneity characteristics of gas-solid adsorption is further confirmed through the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) value that decreases with increasing surface loading.
