Process simulation of flax straw pyrolysis with kinetic reaction Model: Experimental validation and exergy analysis Pyrolysis, a viable method for converting organic material into value-added products, has significant potential to reduce environmental footprints. In this study, slow and fast pyrolysis of flax straw biomass was modeled in an Aspen Plus. This was followed by validation of the product yields (biochar, bio-oil, and gas) with our earlier experimental data with slow pyrolysis. The Aspen Plus model incorporated a kinetic reaction model based on the three main components of lignocellulosic biomass: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The kinetic reaction model includes 21 reactions representing the volatilization, degradation, and decomposition processes inherent in biomass pyrolysis. The Aspen Plus confirmed the consistency of the findings by validating the biogas yield (which ranged from 21.4 wt% to 38.6 wt%), biochar (29.5 wt% to 42.8 wt%), and bio-oil (35.8 wt% to 40.3 wt%). The robustness of the model was verified by experimental data using controlled pyrolysis tests of flax straw feedstock at different temperatures, showing strong agreement. The kinetic reaction model is adaptable for predicting pyrolysis yields for various lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks under typical pyrolysis conditions. Furthermore, energy and exergy analyses were briefly assessed using the product yields, pyrolysis temperature, and heating values of the products at slow and fast pyrolysis conditions. The conventional exergy analysis showed an exergy efficiency of 87–95 % with varying temperatures from 400 to 600 °C for slow pyrolysis, with the highest efficiency obtained at 500 °C. Fast pyrolysis has resulted in a higher exergy efficiency than slow pyrolysis, ranging from 89 % to 98 %.
