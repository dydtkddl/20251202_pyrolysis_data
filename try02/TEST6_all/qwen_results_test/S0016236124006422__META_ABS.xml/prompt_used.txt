You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process simulation of flax straw pyrolysis with kinetic reaction Model: Experimental validation and exergy analysis Pyrolysis, a viable method for converting organic material into value-added products, has significant potential to reduce environmental footprints. In this study, slow and fast pyrolysis of flax straw biomass was modeled in an Aspen Plus. This was followed by validation of the product yields (biochar, bio-oil, and gas) with our earlier experimental data with slow pyrolysis. The Aspen Plus model incorporated a kinetic reaction model based on the three main components of lignocellulosic biomass: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The kinetic reaction model includes 21 reactions representing the volatilization, degradation, and decomposition processes inherent in biomass pyrolysis. The Aspen Plus confirmed the consistency of the findings by validating the biogas yield (which ranged from 21.4 wt% to 38.6 wt%), biochar (29.5 wt% to 42.8 wt%), and bio-oil (35.8 wt% to 40.3 wt%). The robustness of the model was verified by experimental data using controlled pyrolysis tests of flax straw feedstock at different temperatures, showing strong agreement. The kinetic reaction model is adaptable for predicting pyrolysis yields for various lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks under typical pyrolysis conditions. Furthermore, energy and exergy analyses were briefly assessed using the product yields, pyrolysis temperature, and heating values of the products at slow and fast pyrolysis conditions. The conventional exergy analysis showed an exergy efficiency of 87–95 % with varying temperatures from 400 to 600 °C for slow pyrolysis, with the highest efficiency obtained at 500 °C. Fast pyrolysis has resulted in a higher exergy efficiency than slow pyrolysis, ranging from 89 % to 98 %.
