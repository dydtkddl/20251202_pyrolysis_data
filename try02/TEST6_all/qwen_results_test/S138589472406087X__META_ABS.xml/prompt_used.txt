You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understandings in surface metal exsolution of NiFeZn ternary alloy/spinel in ethanol steam reforming: The key to hydrogen production Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) has been recognized as a preferred method for producing hydrogen on a flexible scale. Much effort has been focused on developing a non-noble metal catalyst that can alternate noble metals. Polymetallic catalyst are a type of promising catalyst candidate for hydrogen production because of their adjustable catalytic performance, whereas their catalytic mechanism is still unclear. In this work, quinary metal oxides NiFeMgAlZnOx and CoFeMgAlZnOx were synthesized by a polyol hydrothermal method that was tactically designed for hydrogen production via ESR. Transition metals Ni [3d74s2] and Co [3d84s2] with similar electronic configurations were selected as active components, while Mg, Fe, Zn and Al were employed to form the spinel structure for enhancing the catalyst’s stability. Catalyst performances under different operating conditions were evaluated and compared, and the catalytic mechanism of the MFeMgAlZnOx was revealed. The active sites (surface oxygen species and metal NPs) on NiFeMgAlZnOx and CoFeMgAlZnOx were analyzed and identified, respectively. Interestingly, it was discovered that NiFeZn nanoalloy was generated during the ESR, which formed a supported-like NiFeZn/spinel structure for efficient C–H and C–C bond breaking. The H2 production rate was directly related to the formed NiFeZn nanoalloy. On the other hand, surface oxygen species were the only active site type of CoFeMgAlZnOx that took part in the ESR reaction before 600 °C, which contributed to ethanol convert into C2 products and a low H2 production rate because of its weak C–C bond breaking. It was found that differences in hydrogen production and the coke deposition pathways in ESR were mainly due to the differences in active species.
