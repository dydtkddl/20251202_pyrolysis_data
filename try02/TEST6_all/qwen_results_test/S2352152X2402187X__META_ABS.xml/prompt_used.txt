You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring hydrogen energy systems: A comprehensive review of technologies, applications, prevailing trends, and associated challenges Exploring hydrogen energy and its associated technologies is a pivotal pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality. This article comprehensively reviews hydrogen production technologies, storage technologies, and end-use applications of hydrogen, based on the input energy source, operating conditions, conversion efficiency, energy density, and unit investment cost. The review also highlights the advantages, disadvantages, and technological readiness of hydrogen production technologies, and storage methods. The selected hydrogen production methods include pyrolysis, gasification, fermentation, biophotolysis, electrolysis, thermolysis, and photolysis, while the selected hydrogen storage technologies are compressed, liquid, cryo-compressed, adsorption, and hydrides. Water electrolysis, highly efficient at 55–80 % and versatile, comes with a higher cost of $4.15–$10.30/kg. In contrast, pyrolysis offers more cost-effective solutions with moderate efficiency (35–50 %) and a reasonable yield (25–65 g/kg), making it suitable for budget-sensitive projects. Compressed, liquid, and cryo-compressed hydrogen offer high efficiency with the added benefit of compact storage due to their high volumetric and gravimetric densities. Metal and chemical hydrides provide excellent safety and efficiency, with metal hydrides also delivering high volumetric density for more compact solutions. Furthermore, the review explores the applications of hydrogen energy in renewable energy systems, support to existing grid, transportation, cogeneration and tri-generation, and metallurgy along with insights from pilot projects. Moreover, the article examines the challenges and opportunities encountered in hydrogen production, storage methods, and end-use applications. Finally, the article conducts a SWOT analysis, pinpointing key aspects crucial for the successful adoption of hydrogen in the future. The conclusions indicate that ongoing efforts in performance enhancement, scaling up, and technical advancements are essential to establish a cost-effective hydrogen economy.
