You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Estimating the levels of process parameters for tar and char production via fast pyrolysis of Hypericum perforatum and characterization of the products The influence of pyrolysis temperature, pressure and heating rate was investigated on the tar and char yield from the fast pyrolysis of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort). The experiments were conducted using a fixed bed reactor. Response surface methodology (RSM), with a central composite design (CCD), was used for modeling and optimization of the process parameters. The optimum conditions were found to be at a temperature of 513.13 °C and 400 °C, pressure of 1 and 41 bar and heating rate of 489.39 °C/min and 150 °C/min for maximum tar and char yield, respectively. Maximum yields of tar and char were obtained as 32.98% and 41.23% under optimum process conditions, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultimate analysis, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were used to determine the physico-chemical properties of char, and the chemical properties of tar. The higher heating value of the chars produced at pressurized atmosphere were 29 MJ/kg. GC/MS analysis showed that the tar was rich in phenol, methyl and methoxy phenols, oxygenated benzenes and fatty acids. Furthermore, the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the tar, obtained at pressurized pyrolysis in a nitrogen atmosphere, was investigated. Pressure increased the residence time of the volatile components in the reactor and this phenomenon led to the formation of PAHs. The derived tars were found to contain mainly 2-ring (naphthalene and its derivatives), 3-ring (acenaphthylene, Fluorene, Phenanthrene, 2-methyl anthracene), and 4-ring (Fluoranthene) PAHs.
