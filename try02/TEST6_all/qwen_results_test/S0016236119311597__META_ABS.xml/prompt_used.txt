You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physically activated wheat straw-derived biochar for biomass pyrolysis vapors upgrading with high resistance against coke deactivation Wheat straw-derived biochars (produced through slow pyrolysis at 500 °C and 0.1 MPa) were physically (with CO2) and chemically (with K2CO3) activated to assess their performance as renewable and low-cost catalysts for biomass pyrolysis vapors upgrading. Preliminary cracking experiments, which were carried out at 700 °C using a mixture of four representative model compounds, revealed a clear correlation between the volume of micropores of the catalyst and the total gas production, suggesting that physical activation up to a degree of burn-off of 40% was the most interesting activation route. Next, steam reforming experiments were conducted using the most microporous material to analyze the effect of both the bed temperature and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the total gas production. The results showed a strong dependence between the bed temperature and the total gas production, with the best result obtained at the highest temperature (750 °C). On the other hand, the change in GHSV led to minor changes in the total gas yield, with a maximum achieved at 14500 h−1. Under the best operating conditions deduced in the previous stages, the addition of CO2 into the feed gas stream (partial pressure of 20 kPa) resulted in a total gas production of 98% with a H2/CO molar ratio of 2.16. This good result, which was also observed during the upgrading of the aqueous phase of a real biomass pyrolysis oil, was ascribed to the relatively high coke gasification rate, which refresh the active surface area preventing deactivation by coke deposition.
