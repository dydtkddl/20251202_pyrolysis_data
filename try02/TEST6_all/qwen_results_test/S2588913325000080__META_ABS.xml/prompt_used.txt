You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Renewable activated carbon from wood-based gasification char: A comprehensive study on physical activation Wood gasification produces gasification char (GC), a carbonaceous by-product with limited sustainable valorisation strategies. The physical activation of wood-based GC as a precursor has received insufficient attention, likely due to the inherent challenges associated with the precursor, namely its soft skeleton, high degree of graphitisation, ash content, and reduced porosity. This study investigates methods to enhance the porosity and adsorption properties of renewable activated carbon (AC) derived from GC while maximising yield using a Design of Experiments approach. Yield-oriented porosity optimisation revealed that mild H2O activation ( ⩽ 750 °C, ⩾ 20 min) was the most effective, followed by CO2 activation at 817 °C and 16.2 min. The AC with the highest overall porosity was produced by sequential activation, leveraging the high surface area obtained from H2O activation (812 m2/g) and the high micropore fraction from CO2 activation (49.3 vol%). In micropollutant adsorption assays, this AC (maximum adsorption capacity q max for metoprolol: 89.9 mg / g ) partially outperformed commercial AC ( 89.1 mg / g ). We found that the utilisation of GC for AC production represents a fundamentally distinct starting point when compared to previously employed precursors, as evidenced by significantly reduced activation times and temperatures. This study provides valuable insights for the efficient conversion of GC into high-value AC, a pathway of significant interest for industrial applications.
