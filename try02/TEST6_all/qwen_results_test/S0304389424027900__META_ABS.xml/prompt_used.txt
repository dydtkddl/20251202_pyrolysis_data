You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Association between blood microplastic levels and severity of extracranial artery stenosis Microplastics (MPs) contamination raises concerns about their impact on human health, particularly cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the blood MPs levels in patients with extracranial artery stenosis (ECAS) and their possible link to disease severity. 20 ECAS and 10 control patients were recruited. Blood samples, collected before the digital subtract angiography (DSA) procedure, were analyzed by pyrolysis–gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), laser direct infrared (LDIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Demographic and clinical information was also examined. Strict quality controls were implemented to prevent contamination. MPs were detected by Py-GC/MS in all blood samples, with concentrations significantly higher in ECAS group compared to control (174.89 ± 24.95 vs 79.82 ± 31.73 μg/g, p < 0.001), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide 66 (PA66) were the most abundant among the detected polymers. Further analyses suggested that higher concentrations of MPs may be associated with more severe artery stenosis (p < 0.001). Compared with the normal group, ECAS group had a higher level of D-dimer (0.61 ± 0.6 μg/L vs 0.28 ± 0.09 μg/L, p < 0.05) and longer Thrombin Time (sec) (18.30 ± 3.43 μg/L vs 16.25 ± 1.74 μg/L, p < 0.05). Additionally, LDIR and SEM detected the shape and physical properties of the MPs. In this study, we revealed significant higher blood MPs levels in ECAS patients, with a notable correlation between MPs concentrations and arterial stenosis severity.
