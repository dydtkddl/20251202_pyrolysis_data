You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on thermal properties of bio-char prepared by photo-thermal pyrolysis Photo-thermal pyrolysis provides a new method for the preparation of bio-char through the energy absorption of the intermittent solar energy into the carbon materials to achieve the energy storage and negative carbon emissions. The evolution of thermal properties of different chars prepared by photo-thermal pyrolysis with different final-reaction temperatures and heating rates was studied. The study of specific heat capacity showed that the final-reaction temperature had a stronger impact than the heating rate. At a final-reaction temperature of 800 °C, the maximum specific heat capacity of rice straw and pine char reached 1595 J·kg−1·K−1 and 2070 J·kg−1·K−1 respectively. Measurements of thermal conductivity showed that the higher final-reaction temperature and the higher heating rate both increased the thermal conductivity of char. Rice straw char had a maximum value of 0.2203 W·m−1·K−1 at 800 °C and 500 °C/min, which was almost twice the thermal conductivity of char at 400 °C and 50 °C/min. Further correlation analysis showed the physical structure of the char, especially its density and pore size, had a greater impact on thermal conductivity. The multiple linear model of thermal conductivity was established, which not only had a good fitting effect but also well predicted the thermal conductivity of another kind of char, and the error was within 10%. This study demonstrates the potential of photo-thermal pyrolysis char as a heat carrier and light absorption medium during photo-thermal pyrolysis.
