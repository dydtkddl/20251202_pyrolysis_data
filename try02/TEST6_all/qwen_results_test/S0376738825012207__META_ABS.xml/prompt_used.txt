You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Silica-Based Gas Separation Membranes: Structure–Performance Relationships Across the Si-O Continuum from Polysilsesquioxanes to Amorphous SiO2 Membrane technology offers an energy-efficient and compact alternative to conventional thermally-driven separation processes. However, polymeric membranes are limited by the permeability–selectivity trade-off, plasticization under high-pressure conditions, and physical aging. To overcome these limitations, two promising classes of silica-based membranes have emerged: (1) amorphous silica membranes fabricated by sol-gel or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and (2) hybrid and composite membranes incorporating polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) or ladder-like polysilsesquioxanes (LPSQ) into polymer matrices. This review provides a comprehensive comparison of these silica-based membrane platforms, with a focus on their structure–performance relationships and application-specific advantages. In polysilsesquioxanes (PSQs)-based systems, blending, copolymerization, and crosslinking strategies are shown to improve permeability, interfacial compatibility, and plasticization resistance. In contrast, amorphous silica membranes benefit from rigid Si-O-Si networks that enable molecular sieving, with pore size and connectivity tailored through parameters such as precursor type, pH, dopant addition, and thermal treatment. By consolidating recent progress in both material classes, this review highlights the critical role of molecular-level structural control in achieving targeted gas separation performance and offers a design-oriented perspective toward the development of scalable, robust hybrid membranes for industrial separations, including low-pressure CO2 capture and high-temperature H2 purification.
