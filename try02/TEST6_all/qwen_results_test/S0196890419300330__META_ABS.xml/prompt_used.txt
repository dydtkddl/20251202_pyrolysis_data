You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments in non-thermal catalytic DBD plasma reactor for dry reforming of methane Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is one of the attractive methods for the utilisation of greenhouse gases (e.g., CH4, CO2) to produce valuable fuels. In the quest for an efficient development in DRM, several technologies have been practised, while dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma technology garners special attention in the utilisation of CO2 and CH4 through DRM process due to easy upscaling opportunities and mild operating conditions. However, the low energy efficiency (EE) of DBD plasma is a distinct challenge and it offers an in-depth insight into its basic operational understandings. This review presents the overall status and current developments in DBD plasma for DRM. In the mainstream, challenges in DBD plasma technology, catalyst-plasma interactions and developments in plasma catalysts to improve the yield and selectivity of DRM have been discussed. The current status and developments in DBD reactor configuration based on reactor geometry, such as the electrode morphology, discharge gap (Dgap), discharge volume (VD) and material packing to maximise the productivity of DRM are specifically investigated. The effects of the operating parameters, such as gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), specific input energy (SIE) and feed ratio are critical for product distribution. The current status of reaction kinetics and prospects in fluid modelling of catalytic DBD plasma DRM reactor is reviewed to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. Finally, further advancements in the catalytic DBD plasma DRM has become a requisite to make it commercially viable for the successful production of valuable fuels.
