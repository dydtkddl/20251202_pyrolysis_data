Recent developments in non-thermal catalytic DBD plasma reactor for dry reforming of methane Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is one of the attractive methods for the utilisation of greenhouse gases (e.g., CH4, CO2) to produce valuable fuels. In the quest for an efficient development in DRM, several technologies have been practised, while dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma technology garners special attention in the utilisation of CO2 and CH4 through DRM process due to easy upscaling opportunities and mild operating conditions. However, the low energy efficiency (EE) of DBD plasma is a distinct challenge and it offers an in-depth insight into its basic operational understandings. This review presents the overall status and current developments in DBD plasma for DRM. In the mainstream, challenges in DBD plasma technology, catalyst-plasma interactions and developments in plasma catalysts to improve the yield and selectivity of DRM have been discussed. The current status and developments in DBD reactor configuration based on reactor geometry, such as the electrode morphology, discharge gap (Dgap), discharge volume (VD) and material packing to maximise the productivity of DRM are specifically investigated. The effects of the operating parameters, such as gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), specific input energy (SIE) and feed ratio are critical for product distribution. The current status of reaction kinetics and prospects in fluid modelling of catalytic DBD plasma DRM reactor is reviewed to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. Finally, further advancements in the catalytic DBD plasma DRM has become a requisite to make it commercially viable for the successful production of valuable fuels.
