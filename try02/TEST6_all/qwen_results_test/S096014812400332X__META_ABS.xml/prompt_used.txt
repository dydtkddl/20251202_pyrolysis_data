You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis model for polylactic acid (PLA)/wood composite and its application in predicting combustion behaviors Polylactic acid (PLA)/wood composite has gained great popularity in applications due to its renewable and biodegradable features, whereas quantitative modelling from microscale co-pyrolysis to bench-scale combustion was barely reported. To challenge this issue, poplar wood, PLA and three PLA/wood composites with mass ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 were adopted to conduct thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimeter tests. A numerical model was utilized to examine the interaction between wood and PLA during co-pyrolysis. Kinetics and temperature-dependent thermodynamics of each component were determined by inversely modelling some specific experimental results, while the remaining data were used for model validation. Effective heats of combustion of gas products were estimated by fitting the recorded heat release rates (HRR) in combustion tests. The results showed that PLA/wood composites considerably reduced the peak temperature of co-pyrolysis by 21.7–23.7 K compared to neat PLA. Pyrolysis of wood and PLA could be described by a four-component reaction scheme and a single-step reaction, respectively, whereas two additional reactions were needed to quantify the interaction between PLA and wood. Three methods were used to predict the measured HRRs, and all calculated curves fitted the experimental results well. PLA/wood composites decelerated the thickness regression rate and prolonged the combustion time. Meanwhile, measured CO and CO2 production rates were thoroughly analyzed.
