High performance polymers for oil and gas applications Proper material selection has been one of the most important aspects in the design of chemical process equipment. In particular, the oil and gas industry has transitioned from using metals to non-metals (e.g. advanced and high performance polymeric materials) in most of their structural components, coatings, equipment parts, and the like. It is therefore imperative to understand the advantages and limitations of these polymer materials before they can be effectively used for a specific application. This review article aims to provide an overview of the properties, applications, and durability against reactivity and degradation of high performance polymers commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These include polysulfone, polyetherimide, polyphenylene sulfide, polyetheretherketone, fluoropolymers, and other high performance thermosets, elastomers, and polymer nanocomposites. This article also covers the current research efforts in improving the properties of high performance polymers and expanding their applications (including 3D printing or additive manufacturing) in the oil and gas industry.
