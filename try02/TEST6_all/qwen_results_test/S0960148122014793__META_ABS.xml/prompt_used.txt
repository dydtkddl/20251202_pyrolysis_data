You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of typical plastics and coupled with steam reforming of their derived volatiles for simultaneous production of hydrogen-rich gases and heavy organics Pyrolysis is a thermochemical route for converting waste plastics into hydrocarbons that might be further upgraded to fine chemicals via the process such as hydrotreatment. In this study, the pyrolysis of five typical plastics (PE, PP, PVC, PS and PET) and steam reforming of their derived volatiles were coupled in one process, named as pyro-reforming. The reaction behaviors, especially the property of their derived cokes, in the pyro-reforming were investigated. The results indicated that the volatiles from the pyrolysis of PE had the highest reactivity with steam to produce H2 of the highest yield, followed by that of PP, PVC, PET and PS. The Cl in PVC promoted nickel sintering, enhanced formation of heavy aromatics through aromatization. Moreover, the existence of Cl interrupted formation of carbon nanotube, forming the highest amount of coke with hemp rope-like fiber form of very coarse surface. This was very different from the carbon nanotube form of coke with smooth surface and uniform outer/inner diameters from the pyro-reforming of PE or PP. The pyro-reforming of PET or PS generated mainly the aromatic intermediates that were chemically more inert in steam reforming, forming polymeric type of coke with no carbon nanotube morphology and very low crystallinity.
