Pyrolysis of typical plastics and coupled with steam reforming of their derived volatiles for simultaneous production of hydrogen-rich gases and heavy organics Pyrolysis is a thermochemical route for converting waste plastics into hydrocarbons that might be further upgraded to fine chemicals via the process such as hydrotreatment. In this study, the pyrolysis of five typical plastics (PE, PP, PVC, PS and PET) and steam reforming of their derived volatiles were coupled in one process, named as pyro-reforming. The reaction behaviors, especially the property of their derived cokes, in the pyro-reforming were investigated. The results indicated that the volatiles from the pyrolysis of PE had the highest reactivity with steam to produce H2 of the highest yield, followed by that of PP, PVC, PET and PS. The Cl in PVC promoted nickel sintering, enhanced formation of heavy aromatics through aromatization. Moreover, the existence of Cl interrupted formation of carbon nanotube, forming the highest amount of coke with hemp rope-like fiber form of very coarse surface. This was very different from the carbon nanotube form of coke with smooth surface and uniform outer/inner diameters from the pyro-reforming of PE or PP. The pyro-reforming of PET or PS generated mainly the aromatic intermediates that were chemically more inert in steam reforming, forming polymeric type of coke with no carbon nanotube morphology and very low crystallinity.
