You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research on pyrolysis characteristics and product regulation mechanisms of biomass thermal dissolution residues This study investigates the carbonization behavior of biomass TD residues (PsR, CbR, EpR) and their pyrolysis product distribution. Fixed-bed experiments were conducted to examine the effects of temperature (400–600°C) and heating rate (5–25 °C/min) on biochar properties, product yields, and gas/bio-oil composition. Results show that the residues' low-oxygen, high-carbon nature favors high-quality biochar production. Higher temperatures increased gas yield but reduced biochar formation, while faster heating rates enhanced bio-oil and gas generation via intensified depolymerization. Bio-oil mainly contained aromatics and phenols, with their contents rising at elevated temperatures and heating rates. At 600°C and 10 °C/min, pyrolysis gas contained over 60 % combustible components (CO, CH₄, H₂). Biochar exhibits excellent fuel performance, with PsRbiochar and CbRbiochar displaying a hierarchical pore structure, while EpRbiochar has its pores blocked due to ash melting. Mesoporous PsRbiochar was obtained at 500°C and at 10 °C/min, while higher temperatures and heating rates improved adsorption capacity. This work provides insights into optimizing pyrolysis conditions for high-value utilization of biomass refining residues, supporting a clean production process and resource recycling.
