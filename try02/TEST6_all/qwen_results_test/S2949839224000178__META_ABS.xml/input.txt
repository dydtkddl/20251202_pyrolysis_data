A review of iron-tungstate nanomaterials: Synthesis methods, physicochemical properties, environmental fate and application for wastewater treatment The effective treatment of wastewater to mitigate environmental pollution remains a critical concern in modern society. This review examines the synthesis methods, physicochemical properties, and different application of ferric tungstate (FeWO4) as advanced multifunctional nanomaterial for wastewater treatment. The removal of various pollutants, including heavy metals, organic dyes, emerging contaminants, micro and nanoplastics from wastewater by FeWO4 are discussed. The review also highlights the significant uniqueness of FeWO4 nanoparticles, such as its high surface area, tunable surface chemistry, and adsorption, ozonation, photocatalytic and photo-Fenton capabilities. The environmental implications including the fate of FeWO4 adsorbed pollutants, toxicity and potential secondary pollution, are also discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and limitations, such as regeneration and scalability, that might affect the practical implementation of FeWO4-based treatment systems are also addressed. The multifunctional behaviour of FeWO4 provide insights into its efficiency and applicability in diverse wastewater treatment scenarios. Comparisons with other adsorbents and treatment methods elucidate the distinct advantages of FeWO4. The comprehensive analysis of its synthesis, properties, mechanisms, and applications is a foundation for researchers and practitioners working towards efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment solutions.
