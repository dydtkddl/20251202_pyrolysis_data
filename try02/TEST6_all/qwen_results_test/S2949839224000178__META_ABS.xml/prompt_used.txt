You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of iron-tungstate nanomaterials: Synthesis methods, physicochemical properties, environmental fate and application for wastewater treatment The effective treatment of wastewater to mitigate environmental pollution remains a critical concern in modern society. This review examines the synthesis methods, physicochemical properties, and different application of ferric tungstate (FeWO4) as advanced multifunctional nanomaterial for wastewater treatment. The removal of various pollutants, including heavy metals, organic dyes, emerging contaminants, micro and nanoplastics from wastewater by FeWO4 are discussed. The review also highlights the significant uniqueness of FeWO4 nanoparticles, such as its high surface area, tunable surface chemistry, and adsorption, ozonation, photocatalytic and photo-Fenton capabilities. The environmental implications including the fate of FeWO4 adsorbed pollutants, toxicity and potential secondary pollution, are also discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and limitations, such as regeneration and scalability, that might affect the practical implementation of FeWO4-based treatment systems are also addressed. The multifunctional behaviour of FeWO4 provide insights into its efficiency and applicability in diverse wastewater treatment scenarios. Comparisons with other adsorbents and treatment methods elucidate the distinct advantages of FeWO4. The comprehensive analysis of its synthesis, properties, mechanisms, and applications is a foundation for researchers and practitioners working towards efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment solutions.
