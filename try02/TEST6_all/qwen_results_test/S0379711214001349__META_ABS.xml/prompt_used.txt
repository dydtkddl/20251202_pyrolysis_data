You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Outlining the mechanism of flame retardancy in polyamide 66 blended with melamine-poly(zinc phosphate) Glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 66 is flame retarded with a mixture of melamine-poly(zinc phosphate), (Safire®400) and diethyl aluminium phosphinate. The performance of this synergistic combination of additives is multi-modal and a comprehensive investigation is undertaken to elucidate the underlying flame retardancy mechanism. The strategy was to characterize the different chemical species responsible for flame retardancy that are generated in gas and condensed phases under different fire scenarios. Following heat release rate (HRR) curve of flame retarded polyamide formulations obtained by mass loss calorimeter, samples in different stages of degradation are collected and investigated. Further flame retardants and formulations were degraded in tubular furnace whose temperature protocol relied on thermal degradation profile obtained from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In either case, species generated in condensed phase were studied by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR; 27Al, 31P and 13C), Fourier transform Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy, whereas TGA coupled FTIR, and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py/GC/MS) were utilised to investigate species released in gas phase. Flame retardancy mechanism is elaborated based on the identification of the chemical species in both gas and condensed phases and their specific contributing role.
