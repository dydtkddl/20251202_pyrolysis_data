You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation on the influence of novel catalyst in co-pyrolysis of polymeric waste: Characterization of oil and preparation of char reinforced composites A massive challenge in handling and disposing the polymeric waste, generated by the growing human population and continuous development, has been faced currently as a result of human negligence. Fortunately, among many methods to deal with the problem of increasing polymer debris in the environment, pyrolysis stands out due to its efficiency and accessibility. In the present study, automobile plastic scrap (APS) and tyre crumb rubber (TCR) materials as a combination were subjected to co-pyrolysis using a novel catalyst (NOVC-FZP) that was synthesized using ferrocene and zeolite as precursors. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the raw materials (APS and TCR) shows single-stage decomposition at 402 °C and 340 °C, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis confirms higher production of the hydrocarbon (HC) groups in the oil with NOVC-FZP as compared to the neat oil (without NOVC-FZP). The cetane index of the oil with NOVC-FZP was found to be 22 and the calorific value of the same was 9162 Cal/g. A very high proportion of gasoline (86.8% of oil) was found in the oil resulting from the catalyzed pyrolysis. Solid product char (SPC) obtained through pyrolysis was incorporated into linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to form LLDPE/SPC composite (LCC) for use in several applications rather than disposing it off. Higher mechanical properties like tensile strength, hardness as well as enhanced dielectric constant were exhibited by the prepared LCC.
