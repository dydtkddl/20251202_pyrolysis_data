You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of oligodextran production in an ultrafiltration stirred-cell membrane reactor The aim of this study was to investigate the types of oligodextrans that could be generated via controlled enzymatic depolymerization of dextran using an endodextranase. An ultrafiltration stirred-cell membrane reactor was employed to provide the means of controlling product molecular size and characteristics. The process was operated in batch mode and the products were recovered as permeates. The effect of enzyme concentration (0.625–62.5 U ml−1 substrate), substrate concentration (2.5–7.5% w/v), and transmembrane pressure (200–400 kPa), each at three levels, on the product characteristics were studied. The experiments were arranged according to a central composite statistical design. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to assess factor interactions and empirical models regarding four product response variables (i.e., permeate flux, yield, dextrose equivalent, and oligosaccharide content) were fitted. The fit of the models was found to be good. Permeate flux ranged from 0.01–0.11 (ml cm−2 min−1) and was significantly affected by the interactions among the operating variables. Dextrose equivalent values (DE) ranged from 18–38 with significant interaction between the enzyme concentration and substrate concentration. DE increased with increasing enzyme concentration and decreased substrate concentration. Product yields ranged from 25–84% and were principally related to the enzyme concentration. The oligosaccharide content of the products ranged from 27–82% (w/w) and was characterized by significant interactions among the operating variables. The use of RSM for modelling these types of membrane reactors is discussed.
