Advances in carbon-based materials for solar-driven steam generation, desalination and water treatment As water scarcity escalates globally, recycling and reusing water resources is crucial for ensuring sustainable access to clean water. Photothermal technology for seawater desalination and wastewater treatment applications is promising towards solving the demand for clean water. This review explores the innovative use of carbon-based sunlight absorbers for solar-driven steam generation, a key method for desalinating seawater and treating wastewater. Turning waste into wonder carbon absorbers materials could help solve the globe's escalating water crisis and thus, the exploration for valorizing waste resources including agricultural, food, paper, textile and plastic wastes to derive such absorbers sustainably were carefully reviewed. This review surveys recent advancements in engineering carbon-based materials from waste streams for photothermal water treatment, analyzing the interplay between composition, morphology, and performance. It also addresses the current limitations and suggests potential improvements. Solar evaporation systems have demonstrated feasibility but require optimization of absorbers morphology, chemical make-up and system integration to become viable for practical large-scale implementation. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the need for continued research and development to address existing challenges, underscoring the significance of this technology in providing a sustainable solution to the increasing global demand for clean water.
