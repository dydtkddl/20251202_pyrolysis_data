You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in carbon-based materials for solar-driven steam generation, desalination and water treatment As water scarcity escalates globally, recycling and reusing water resources is crucial for ensuring sustainable access to clean water. Photothermal technology for seawater desalination and wastewater treatment applications is promising towards solving the demand for clean water. This review explores the innovative use of carbon-based sunlight absorbers for solar-driven steam generation, a key method for desalinating seawater and treating wastewater. Turning waste into wonder carbon absorbers materials could help solve the globe's escalating water crisis and thus, the exploration for valorizing waste resources including agricultural, food, paper, textile and plastic wastes to derive such absorbers sustainably were carefully reviewed. This review surveys recent advancements in engineering carbon-based materials from waste streams for photothermal water treatment, analyzing the interplay between composition, morphology, and performance. It also addresses the current limitations and suggests potential improvements. Solar evaporation systems have demonstrated feasibility but require optimization of absorbers morphology, chemical make-up and system integration to become viable for practical large-scale implementation. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the need for continued research and development to address existing challenges, underscoring the significance of this technology in providing a sustainable solution to the increasing global demand for clean water.
