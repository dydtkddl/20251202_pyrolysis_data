You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of post heat-treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Hastelloy-X structures manufactured by laser based Directed Energy Deposition This paper reports a systematic investigation of Hastelloy-X (Hast-X) structures built by Laser Directed Energy Deposition in as-built and post heat-treated conditions. The optical microscopy shows microstructures with fine dendrites in as-built condition due to higher cooling rate during deposition, while recrystallized equiaxed grains are observed after post heat-treatment (at 1177 °C) due to recrystallization. X-ray diffraction studies reveal nickel γ-matrix with variation in crystallite size and a peak shift after post heat-treatment, primarily due to change in surface residual stress. Surface topography reveals the reduction in average roughness with post heat-treatment. Further, the maximum compressive residual stress of 350 MPa and maximum tensile residual stress of 252 MPa are observed at the surfaces of post heat-treated and as-built samples, respectively. The average micro-hardness changed from 239 HV1.96N to 208 HV1.96N after post heat-treatment. Single Cycle Ball Indentation studies indicated increase in energy storage capacity by a factor of 1.55 after post heat-treatment. Automated Ball Indentation studies quantify yield strength and ultimate strength as 478 MPa and 765 MPa in as-built samples, while 393 MPa and 630 MPa in post heat-treated samples, respectively. Further, crack propagation studies indicate an improvement in the fatigue life after post heat-treatment, while the specific wear rate increased by a factor of 1.72 with increased delamination in heat-treated samples. Thus, post heat-treatment of Hast-X samples changes the material properties significantly.
