You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable syngas production from thermochemical processing of cellulosic textile waste in the presence of CO2 In response to ever-expanding textile industry, substantial generation in clothing waste has posed the environmental risks caused by conventional treatments. As an alternative approach, this study aims to establish pyrolytic valorisation of cellulosic textile waste. To impart sustainability to the pyrolysis system, a novel approach was proposed by employing carbon dioxide (CO2), key greenhouse gas, as reactive feedstock. This study mainly investigated mechanical function of carbon dioxide on all pyrogenic products derived from cellulosic textile waste. Remarkably, CO2 interacted with volatile pyrogenic products and transformed them into carbon monoxide (CO). CO2 led to 0.82 times reduction of carbohydrate compounds and 1.18 times increase of CO, in reference to the results from N2. To further enhance the identified reactivity of CO2, the established experimental setup was modified by installing an additional furnace (isothermally heated at 600 °C) and a nickel catalyst (5 wt% Ni/Al2O3). Consequently, CO production from the proposed catalytic pyrolysis increased by 2.01 times. The findings demonstrate that introducing CO2 to the pyrolysis system contributed to the improvement of carbon utilisation efficiency in the form of CO. Therefore, this study offers a framework highlighting technical reliability of carbon dioxide-assisted pyrolysis system for promoting environmental sustainability and resource recovery.
