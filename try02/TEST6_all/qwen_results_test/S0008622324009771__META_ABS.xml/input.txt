Emerging 2D MXene quantum dots for catalytic conversion of CO2 MXene is an emerging material for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products because of its robust physical and chemical properties. The high specific surface area (SSA), conductivity, and stability of the MXene make it an attractive material for the catalytic conversion of CO2. The pristine MXene possessed poor catalytic properties as compared to their composites. This study briefly discussed the magical properties and advanced synthesizing routes of MXene and MXene quantum dots (MQDs). In addition, the oxidation of the MXene is responsible for altering its chemical composition, and the factors used to oxidize the MXene were discussed in detail. Furthermore, the mechanism of hydrogenation, chemical, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has been discussed. Finally, the MXene quantum dots (MQDs) for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 for the first time also present the future challenges and prospectus associated with MXene.
