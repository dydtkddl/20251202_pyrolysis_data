You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-temperature degradation of waste epoxy resin polymer improved by swelling-assisted pyrolysis The disposal of waste epoxy resin matrix composite becomes an urgent issue, and pyrolysis is an effective method to decompose the epoxy resin polymer, but the high operating temperature hinders its application. In this study, a swelling-assisted pyrolysis method was proposed for the low-temperature decomposition of epoxy resin. It was found that the degradation ratio of epoxy resin increased from 59.13 % to 79.10 % at 300 °C after the swelling treatment with acetic acid. Compared with traditional pyrolysis, the cracking of epoxy resin was promoted in the swelling-assisted pyrolysis, increasing the yields of pyrolysis gas and oil, as well as enriching the light components in pyrolysis oil and raising the graphite degree of pyrolysis char. Following the characterizations and reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulation, the key mechanisms of swelling-assisted pyrolysis were determined as the interaction of the enhanced heat transfer and the accelerated ring-open reactions. After the swelling treatment, epoxy resin became porous, improving the heat transfer in the pyrolysis process. Meanwhile, abundant O radicals were generated with the decomposition of acetic acid, accelerating the ring-open reactions of benzene rings. The results could provide promising guidance for the pyrolysis recovery of epoxy resin matrix composites towards the circular economy.
