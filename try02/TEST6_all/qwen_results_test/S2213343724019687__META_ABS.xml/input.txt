Effect of interaction between different plastics and polyvinyl chloride on the chlorine transformation behavior in volatiles during low-temperature pyrolysis To reduce the pollution during the pyrolysis recovery of chlorine-containing plastic waste from different sources, effects of the interaction between different plastics and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on the transformation of chlorine at low temperature were investigated by thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) and fixed-bed pyrolysis experiments. Results showed that the proportions of chlorine in chars were all <0.04 %, indicating that almost all chlorine was released after pyrolysis. However, the chlorine forms in volatiles were significantly changed with mixing different plastics. HCl production was significantly inhibited due to the addition of other plastics, while the organic chlorinated compounds (OCCs) formation was promoted, which increased the distribution of chlorine in liquid products. During PVC pyrolysis, chlorine was mainly distributed in gas (93.09 %) in the form of HCl, only a small amount of aliphatic chlorides were generated and distributed in liquid (6.89 %). After the addition of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the chlorine distribution in liquid increased to 8.86 %, 11.98 % and 25.99 %, respectively. The formation of OCCs was significantly affected by the difference in thermochemical reaction characteristics of plastics. Specifically, the production of aromatic chlorides was promoted by PS, while the generation of aliphatic chlorides and aromatic chloroesters was significantly promoted by PE and PET, respectively. Therefore, the release form of chlorine could be significantly altered by the interaction between PVC and other waste plastics, which provides a reference for the regulation of chlorine-containing pollutants in the recovery and utilization of plastic waste.
