Effect of gypsum addition on syngas production during CO2-assisted gasification of pinewood This study investigates the potential synergistic effects of incorporating gypsum in CO2-assisted gasification of pinewood. The synergistic interaction between pinewood and gypsum enhanced the efficiency of pinewood conversion into syngas, while simultaneously facilitating the conversion of gypsum into chemically valuable substances, such as calcium sulfide. During gasification, pinewood generated substantial quantities of tars and unreactive char. Tars, being compounds of considerable stability, present a significant obstacle in terms of achieving high conversion efficiency. The presence of gypsum increased the syngas yield from the conversion of char and tars. The results presented here empirically examined the impact of varying quantities of gypsum on the production of hydrogen (H2) and syngas during its CO2-assisted gasification with pinewood. The overall yield of syngas increased by up to 11.7 % while the LHV improved by 12.5 % using 16.67 wt.% of gypsum in pinewood. However, increased mass fractions of gypsum to 50 wt.% negatively affected the syngas production and reduced the syngas yield and LHV by 22 % and 21 %, respectively.
