Functionalized ceramics for biomedical, biotechnological and environmental applications Surface functionalization has become of paramount importance and is considered a fundamental tool for the development and design of countless devices and engineered systems for key technological areas in biomedical, biotechnological and environmental applications. In this review, surface functionalization strategies for alumina, zirconia, titania, silica, iron oxide and calcium phosphate are presented and discussed. These materials have become particularly important concerning the aforementioned applications, being not only of great academic, but also of steadily increasing human and commercial, interest. In this review, special emphasis is given to their use as biomaterials, biosensors, biological targets, drug delivery systems, implants, chromatographic supports for biomolecule purification and analysis, and adsorbents for toxic substances and pollutants. The objective of this review is to provide a broad picture of the enormous possibilities offered by surface functionalization and to identify particular challenges regarding surface analysis and characterization.
