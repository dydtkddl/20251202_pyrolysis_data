Thermolytic decomposition of coniferyl alcohol Thermolytic decomposition of coniferyl alcohol was studied at temperatures between 200°C and 275°C under an inert atmosphere, to shed more light on the initial thermal reactions in the thermochemical conversion of lignin. In this temperature range, dimerization and oligomerization reactions dominate, while side chain CC bond scission, dehydration, rearrangement and hydrogen transfer reactions are partly obscured. The thermolytic reactions of the allylic side chain occur more easily than those of the aryl-alkyl ether linkage. The primary aliphatic hydroxyl group is a site of transferable hydrogen. The major monoaromatic products formed are dihydroconiferyl alcohol, coniferaidehyde, cis- and trans-isoeugenol, eugenol and dihydroconiferaldehyde.
