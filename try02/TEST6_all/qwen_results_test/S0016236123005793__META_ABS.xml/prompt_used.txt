You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanotubes production from catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over nickel-based catalysts: The influence of support materials To understand the influence of support materials on the reactivity of catalysts, four nickel- based catalysts supported on different materials (ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Al2O3) were developed and investigated in the carbon nanotubes production from catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene using two-stage fixed bed reactor. The results showed that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst generated the highest carbon material yield of 36.5 wt%, while the order of carbon material yield was Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/TiO2 > Ni/ZrO2 > Ni/Nb2O5. To explore the correlation between catalysts properties and carbon products, the essential structural characteristics of fresh catalyst and reacted catalyst were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature program oxidation (TPO), nitrogen adsorption measurements and Raman spectroscopy. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with the highest surface area, abundant pore structure, and moderate metal-support interaction promoted the decomposition of pyrolysis volatiles to produce carbon nanomaterials, which were consist of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs are the main component of carbon materials produced, accounting for a relatively high proportion. In comparison, the large metal active particles and weak metal-support interaction of Ni/TiO2 catalyst had a negative impact on the formation of CNTs, generating many fishbone like carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Moreover, the poor pore structure and larger metal active particles for Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Nb2O5 catalyst led to a low carbon deposition yield and poor quality of CNTs. The results provide valuable data and theoretical support for the research on the preparation of valuable carbon nanotubes from waste plastics.
