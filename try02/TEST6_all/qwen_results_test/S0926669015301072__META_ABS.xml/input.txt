Production of aromatic compounds from oil palm empty fruit bunches by hydro- and solvothermolysis The production of bio-crude oil (BCO) from oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) by hydro- and solvothermolysis methods was investigated. The effects of the reaction temperature, reaction time, the solvent and inorganic matter were studied using a batch reactor. The yield of BCO, the molecular weight of BCO, and the yield of aromatic compounds contained in the BCO were measured. The molecular weight of BCO decreased as the reaction temperature increased; however, the yield of BCO and aromatic compounds decreased at a high temperature and with a long reaction time. The maximum yield of the total BCO was obtained when the ratio of water and ethanol was 50:50, while the yield of most monomeric compounds was highest when the ratio of water and ethanol was 25:75. The inorganic matter in the raw EFB increased the yield of BCO and monomeric compounds compared to that with washed EFB.
