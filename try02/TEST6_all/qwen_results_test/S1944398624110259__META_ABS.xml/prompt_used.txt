You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction and optimization of steroid hormone removal parameters from municipal wastewater by ultrasound probe using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm: a review Estrogens are one of the micropollutants in the wastewater which are harmful to the aquatic. Because the biological processes in wastewater treatment plants cannot completely remove micro-pollutants, these compounds are present in wastewater effluents. Therefore, we need a treatment method to remove the hormones from the wastewater. Ultrasound waves are very effective to eliminate the micropollutants. This study is based on an analysis of publications published since 2000. Here, ultrasound-assisted research on the removal of hormones (estrone (E1) and 17β-estradiol (E2)) from wastewater were studied, then data was collected from existing papers and the model was applied to them. Hormone removal from the wastewater by ultrasound-assisted was modeled and optimized using a multilayer artificial neural network coupled with a genetic algorithm. A network was designed in multilayer perceptron. Various training algorithms were evaluated, and the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm was selected as the best one. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was 12, according to the maximum correlation coefficient (R), the lowest absolute mean error, the lowest mean bias error, and the minimum mean square error. According to the results of genetic algorithm, the optimum performance conditions were determined, and the results showed that increasing pH and power density, increased the efficiency of hormone removal from the wastewater. Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed by the Spearman method.
