Characteristics, kinetics, infrared analysis and process optimization of co-pyrolysis of waste tires and oily sludge The ecology was severely harmed by waste tires (WT) and oily sludge (OS). The OS and WT combinations' co-pyrolysis features, synergistic effects, and gas products were studied using thermogravimetric-infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). To study kinetics and optimize pyrolysis, the Coats-Redfern and response surface methods were used. The results revealed that the OS and WT co-pyrolysis has synergistic effects. The major pyrolysis temperature range and the pyrolysis residual rate increased as the heating rate increased, and the E of the reaction increased. The strength of small-molecular-gases precipitation was modified by increasing the ratio of WT to OS, which increased OS pyrolysis. CH4, CO2, CO, and H2O are the most common gas products. The minimum estimated E and residual amount were 40.599 kJ/mol and 39.33%, respectively, when the WT mixture ratio was 58.7% and the heating rate was 10 °C/min. All the study contributes basic data to the development of the treatment of OS and WT in collaboration.
