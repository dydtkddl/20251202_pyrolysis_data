You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green threads of progress: Natural fibers reshaping wastewater cleanup strategies, a review The introduction of chemicals, plastics, and toxic pollutants amplified with commercialization and industrialization outpaced the proficiency in accession of these entities away from the planetary borders, leading to the generation of harmful and toxic chemicals that pollutes the atmosphere and water bodies cognate with it. Thus, treating or alleviating these harmful and perilous materials from the wastewater system using a green modus operandi became more imperative. Adsorption with various natural and synthetic systems (2D materials, zeolites, nanomaterials, polymers, natural fibers), are employed for the facile and adept removal of toxic matters such as heavy metals and organic materials from different effluents like textile and industrial. However, the application of natural fibers (NF) which are renowned for their eco-friendly and sustainable nature opens a new-fangled and sustainable method in water remediation in integration of the water purification competence of nature with science and technology. NF is emerging as formidable alternatives to conventional adsorbents and synthetic fibers in the eradication of diverse contaminants from wastewater matrices. This comprehensive review delves into the multifaceted application of natural fibers as biosorbents, elucidating their efficacy in sequestering heavy metals, dyes, toxins, nano-plastics, and an array of pollutants prevalent in industrial effluents and tainted water reservoirs. Most of the observations are explained in terms of (1) adsorption capacities of various natural fibers, (2) toxicity assessment of various pollutants, (3) factors such as surface chemistry, kinetics, isotherms, thermodynamics, and methodologies for augmentation are meticulously evaluated to ascertain and optimize pollutant uptake, and (4) strategies for regeneration and reuse.
