Green threads of progress: Natural fibers reshaping wastewater cleanup strategies, a review The introduction of chemicals, plastics, and toxic pollutants amplified with commercialization and industrialization outpaced the proficiency in accession of these entities away from the planetary borders, leading to the generation of harmful and toxic chemicals that pollutes the atmosphere and water bodies cognate with it. Thus, treating or alleviating these harmful and perilous materials from the wastewater system using a green modus operandi became more imperative. Adsorption with various natural and synthetic systems (2D materials, zeolites, nanomaterials, polymers, natural fibers), are employed for the facile and adept removal of toxic matters such as heavy metals and organic materials from different effluents like textile and industrial. However, the application of natural fibers (NF) which are renowned for their eco-friendly and sustainable nature opens a new-fangled and sustainable method in water remediation in integration of the water purification competence of nature with science and technology. NF is emerging as formidable alternatives to conventional adsorbents and synthetic fibers in the eradication of diverse contaminants from wastewater matrices. This comprehensive review delves into the multifaceted application of natural fibers as biosorbents, elucidating their efficacy in sequestering heavy metals, dyes, toxins, nano-plastics, and an array of pollutants prevalent in industrial effluents and tainted water reservoirs. Most of the observations are explained in terms of (1) adsorption capacities of various natural fibers, (2) toxicity assessment of various pollutants, (3) factors such as surface chemistry, kinetics, isotherms, thermodynamics, and methodologies for augmentation are meticulously evaluated to ascertain and optimize pollutant uptake, and (4) strategies for regeneration and reuse.
