You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Organometal catalyst promoted Mechano-chemical depolymerization of post-consumer Polyethylene terephthalate to non-ortho phthalate plasticizer for PVC flexibility Plastic waste mismanagement poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and human beings. Depolymerization through Chemical recycling (Alcoholysis) is an emerging solution. Plastic waste particularly, PET has been depolymerized through an intensified reactor system to a non-ortho phthalate green plasticizer, dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP). Different catalysts were synthesized for effective conversion with butyl stannic acid (0.5 %) resulting in 100 % conversion and 90 % yield within 180 min at refluxing 2-ethyl hexanol conditions (185–190 °C) at 1:3 feed to solvent ratio. The intensified reactor configuration reduced the PET dissolution time to 30 min by overcoming the mass transfer limitations which otherwise take 120–180 min for reaction homogenization. Product purity, DOTP was characterized by 1H NMR with an ester content of 99.20 % by mass, acid value 0.04 mg KOH/g, APHA (<5 %), and refractive index of 1.5110. A side product, terephthalic acid was formed during the product purification steps and was purified using glacial acetic acid as recrystallization media. The synthesized DOTP is further tested as a plasticizer with PVC resins in different parts per hundred (phr) to break its interstrand-dipole and soften it for specific applications. The plasticized material shows better thermal stability and more flexibility than pure PVC with a maximum tensile strength of 18.74 ± 0.4155 MPa for 33.3 phr. This work provides a sustainable pathway from a linear to a circular economy using an organometal catalyst for PET depolymerization.
