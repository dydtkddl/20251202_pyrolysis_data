You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coal gasification in CO2 atmosphere and its kinetics since 1948: A brief review Numerous coal gasification studies have been found in the literature those employed various kinds of gasifying agents such as steam and carbon dioxide. These studies are featured with wide variations in the parametric conditions and the usage of equipments. Steam is frequently employed as a gasifying agent, however, in several studies carbon dioxide has also been used as a gasifying agent either pure or in combination with other gasifying agents (H2O, O2, CO, H2). This paper is a brief review of the coal gasification with CO2 as a diluent. Different factors were studied over the coal gasification with CO2 such as coal rank, pressure, temperature, gas composition, catalyst and the minerals present inside the coal, heating rate, particle size, and diverse reactor types. It also deals with the application of the gas–solid models developed in the literature and the combustion and gasification mechanisms for O2/CO2 streams. Moreover, it reviews the kinetics and the reaction rate equations (Arrhenius and Langmuir–Hinshelwood types) for coal-char gasification both in the reaction kinetic control region (low temperature) and the diffusion control region (high temperature) and at both low and high pressures.
