You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of nitrogen, bromine, and chlorine from PP/PE/PS/PVC/ABS–Br pyrolysis liquid products using Fe- and Ca-based catalysts The thermal and catalytic degradation of a complex polymer mixture was performed at 450°C at atmospheric pressure in a batch process. The mixture contained polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer with a brominated flame retardant and antimony oxide synergist (ABS–Br) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), in a 3/3/2/1/1 weight ratio. The effect of iron (FeOOH and Fe–C composite) and calcium (CaCO3 and Ca–C composite) based catalysts for removal of heteroatom- (nitrogen, bromine, and chlorine) containing compounds in oil products was studied. Changes in the amount and distribution of heteroatoms were described using NP gram curves. Iron catalysts give best results for bromine removal from decomposition oil while calcium catalysts have high efficiency for chlorine removal; however, both Fe- and Ca-catalysts have low effect in nitrogen removal. Carbon composite catalysts give three times less chlorine but they produce higher amounts of nitrogen in degradation oils than the corresponding Fe and Ca pure compounds. In bromine removal Ca–C composite shows higher effect compared to CaCO3 while Fe–C composite has slightly worse effect than FeOOH.
