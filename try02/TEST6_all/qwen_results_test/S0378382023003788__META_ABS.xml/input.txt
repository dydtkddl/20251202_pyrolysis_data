Method development and evaluation of product gas mixture from a semi-industrial scale fluidized bed steam cracker with GC-VUV Steam cracking in fluidized beds offers an alternative to conventional steam cracking for sustainable hydrocarbon production. This approach has gained interest, particularly in the context of recycling plastics to generate valuable hydrocarbons. Integrating this process into existing petrochemical clusters necessitates a thorough characterization of the products derived from this new feedstock. This work focuses on addressing the challenges associated with species quantification and characterization time for assessing the product mixture resulting from a steam cracking process. The experiments were conducted in a semi-industrial scale dual fluidized bed steam cracker, utilizing polyethylene as the feedstock. To sample species spanning from C1 to C18, cooling, scrubbing, and adsorption were introduced. These steps were integrated with GC-VUV (Gas Chromatography with Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectroscopy) and other widely recognized analytical methods to quantify the sampled species. The primary focus was on GC-VUV analysis as a suitable characterization method for identifying and quantifying C4 to C18 species, which can constitute up to 35% of the product mixture obtained from polyethylene steam cracking (750 °C to 850 °C). Quantifying C6 to C18 hydrocarbons becomes the time-critical step, with GC-VUV potentially achieving this in 1/6th of the analysis time and with relatively optimal quantification compared to the traditional characterization methods.
