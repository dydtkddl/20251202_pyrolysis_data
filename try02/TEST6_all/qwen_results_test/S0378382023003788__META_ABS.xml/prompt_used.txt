You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Method development and evaluation of product gas mixture from a semi-industrial scale fluidized bed steam cracker with GC-VUV Steam cracking in fluidized beds offers an alternative to conventional steam cracking for sustainable hydrocarbon production. This approach has gained interest, particularly in the context of recycling plastics to generate valuable hydrocarbons. Integrating this process into existing petrochemical clusters necessitates a thorough characterization of the products derived from this new feedstock. This work focuses on addressing the challenges associated with species quantification and characterization time for assessing the product mixture resulting from a steam cracking process. The experiments were conducted in a semi-industrial scale dual fluidized bed steam cracker, utilizing polyethylene as the feedstock. To sample species spanning from C1 to C18, cooling, scrubbing, and adsorption were introduced. These steps were integrated with GC-VUV (Gas Chromatography with Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectroscopy) and other widely recognized analytical methods to quantify the sampled species. The primary focus was on GC-VUV analysis as a suitable characterization method for identifying and quantifying C4 to C18 species, which can constitute up to 35% of the product mixture obtained from polyethylene steam cracking (750 °C to 850 °C). Quantifying C6 to C18 hydrocarbons becomes the time-critical step, with GC-VUV potentially achieving this in 1/6th of the analysis time and with relatively optimal quantification compared to the traditional characterization methods.
