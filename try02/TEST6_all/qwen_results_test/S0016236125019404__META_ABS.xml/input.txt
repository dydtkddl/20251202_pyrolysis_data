A novel integrated sorption enhanced co-gasification combined cycle and blue hydrogen production This paper proposes a novel integrated combined cycle with blue hydrogen production via sorption enhanced co-gasification (SECG). As a carbon–neutral type of renewable energy, biomass and solar are beneficial for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) in the power sector. The application of renewable energy sources such as biomass and solar for hydrogen and power generation is becoming increasingly important, as is hydrogen production for use as a fuel or for other purposes. Biomass and coal co-gasification process integrated with solar energy is proposed here. Cotton stalk and brown coal are chosen as the fuel and steam as the gasifying agent. The proposed system is investigated in detail using thermodynamic approaches of exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analyses A novel system based on a reference combined cycle is proposed for a fixed gross power output of 57 MW.The system features solar-assisted co-gasification with preheated fuel to improve syngas quality, sorbent regeneration and steam generation processes to reduce supplementary fuel consumption. The in-situ calcium looping CO2 capture unit is used for blue hydrogen production, ensuring a low CO2 emission rate.Sensitivity analyses are conducted to optimize hydrogen production, achieving a maximum hydrogen purity of 99.59 % and a yield of 0.094–0.132 kg H2/kg feed. The system demonstrates an exergy efficiency of 41.77–43.8 %, producing 37.32–37.82 MW of net electrical power, 23.39 MW of heat, and 47.33–51.32 t/h of pure hydrogen. The in-situ CO2 capture process reduces specific CO2 emissions to 66.92–79.83 kg CO2/MWh, significantly mitigating environmental impact. The levelized cost of hydrogen is estimated at 6.27–6.57 US$/MWh, while the environmental impact of blue hydrogen production ranged from 90.26 to 96.92 mPts/kg H2. This represents a lower impact compared to other similar technologies, owing to improved resource utilization.
