You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel integrated sorption enhanced co-gasification combined cycle and blue hydrogen production This paper proposes a novel integrated combined cycle with blue hydrogen production via sorption enhanced co-gasification (SECG). As a carbon–neutral type of renewable energy, biomass and solar are beneficial for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) in the power sector. The application of renewable energy sources such as biomass and solar for hydrogen and power generation is becoming increasingly important, as is hydrogen production for use as a fuel or for other purposes. Biomass and coal co-gasification process integrated with solar energy is proposed here. Cotton stalk and brown coal are chosen as the fuel and steam as the gasifying agent. The proposed system is investigated in detail using thermodynamic approaches of exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analyses A novel system based on a reference combined cycle is proposed for a fixed gross power output of 57 MW.The system features solar-assisted co-gasification with preheated fuel to improve syngas quality, sorbent regeneration and steam generation processes to reduce supplementary fuel consumption. The in-situ calcium looping CO2 capture unit is used for blue hydrogen production, ensuring a low CO2 emission rate.Sensitivity analyses are conducted to optimize hydrogen production, achieving a maximum hydrogen purity of 99.59 % and a yield of 0.094–0.132 kg H2/kg feed. The system demonstrates an exergy efficiency of 41.77–43.8 %, producing 37.32–37.82 MW of net electrical power, 23.39 MW of heat, and 47.33–51.32 t/h of pure hydrogen. The in-situ CO2 capture process reduces specific CO2 emissions to 66.92–79.83 kg CO2/MWh, significantly mitigating environmental impact. The levelized cost of hydrogen is estimated at 6.27–6.57 US$/MWh, while the environmental impact of blue hydrogen production ranged from 90.26 to 96.92 mPts/kg H2. This represents a lower impact compared to other similar technologies, owing to improved resource utilization.
