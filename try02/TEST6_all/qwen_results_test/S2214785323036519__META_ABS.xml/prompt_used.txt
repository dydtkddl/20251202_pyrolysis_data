You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multifluid computational fluid dynamics simulation for sawdust gasification inside an industrial scale fluidized bed gasifier Scarcity of fossil fuels, and to fulfill the energy demand of the increasing population, researchers need to shift their attention to the alternative of fossil fuels. It would be impractical and time-consuming to conduct extensive experiments on Fluidized Bed Gasifiers (FBG) of varying fuel types, sizes, geometries and operating conditions. The objective of the current research work is focused on numerical simulation of hydrodynamics behavior and sawdust gasification in an industrial scale FBG using the Eulerian-Eulerian multifluid model. For the accurate prediction of thermal and hydraulic performance (bed voidage, suspension density, pressure drop, heat transfer, and combustion kinetics), one should incorporate the correct parameters in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of a fluidized bed gasifier. It includes the multiphase gasification modeling using the Eulerian-Eulerian approach with an user defined heterogeneous reaction kinetics. The adopted CFD methodology is validated with experimental data and extended for the prediction of gasification characteristics of sawdust by incorporating eight heterogeneous (moisture release, volatile cracking, tar cracking, tar oxidation, char combustion, CO₂ gasification, steam gasification, methanation reaction) and five homogeneous oxidation of CO, CH₄, H₂, forward and backward water gas shift (WGS) reactions. In the result section, composition of gasification products is analyzed, along with the hydrodynamics of sawdust and sand phase, heat transfer between the gas, sand and sawdust, reaction rates of different homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions are being analyzed along the height of the domain.
