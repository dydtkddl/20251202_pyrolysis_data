You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermo-economic analysis of a polygeneration system using biogas and waste tire based on the integration of solid oxide fuel cell, gas turbine, pyrolysis, and organic rankine cycle To optimize the biogas power generation process and waste tire disposal, a novel polygeneration system has been conceptualized. The hybrid design comprises a solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine subsystem, tire pyrolysis reactor, organic Rankine cycle, and waste heat recovery subsystem. The biogas is first utilized by the solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine for power generation. Subsequently, the high-temperature exhaust is utilized to preheat the fuel and oxidant and to heat the pyrolysis reactor and organic Rankine cycle, thereby improving the power generation and energy conversion efficiency. A comprehensive case study has been carried out to verify technological and economic feasibility of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that the net energy efficiency of the system is 70.11 % with an exergy efficiency of 69.65 %, and that the hybrid system maintains a high level of performance even when the fuel cell operating temperature varies. The irreversibility mainly arises from the pyrolysis reactor, cell stack, and combustion chamber. The new design requires only an initial investment of 722.93 k$ and can be recovered in 5.09 years with a net present value of 1795.51 k$ over its 25-year service life. Therefore, the proposed system is highly promising and suitable for implementation.
