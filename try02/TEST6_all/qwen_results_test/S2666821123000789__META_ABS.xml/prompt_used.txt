You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction of tar yield produced from devolatilisation of empty fruit bunch in a fluidised-bed reactor using pseudo-equilibrium model In this work, a pseudo-equilibrium model (PEM) is developed for prediction of yield and product from devolatilisation of empty fruit bunch (EFB). The yield of individual species (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, bio-oil, tar, and char) from the primary decomposition of EFB is expressed empirically. Subsequently, they are the inputs to the secondary reaction region. In the secondary reactions zone, the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR) is treated under equilibrium conditions, but kinetically modified by a factor to predict the concentration of the four gases (H2, CO, CO2, and H2O) which participated in this reaction. Meanwhile, the methane, bio-oil and tar are modelled separately in a purely kinetic environment by applying a plug flow reactor (PFR) model to estimate the conversion of both species. The model is further to investigate the effects of changes in the operating conditions of devolatilisation such as temperature and carrier gas flow rate. The results showed a good prediction for tar yield with low root mean square (RMS = 0.003) compared to experiments, and conversion (59.7%) compared to experiments (51.5%) at 850 °C. A sensitivity analysis for the pyrolysis model was conducted to investigate the effects of process temperature and nitrogen gas flowrate. Tar yield was significantly reduced at high temperatures. Meanwhile, the change of nitrogen flowrate resulted in slight increase of tar yield. Reasonable predictions were obtained for other products.
