You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dechlorination of waste polyvinyl chloride (PVC) via its co-pyrolysis with Ca(OH)2: A TG-IR-GCMS investigation Being the most deployed thermoplastic worldwide, waste polyvinyl chloride (PVC) generation is expected to increase by about 80% over the next couple of decades. Chlorine toxication during the incineration process is a menace for waste handling facilities though various PVC management is in place. Hence, effective chloride capture is considered the primary focus during PVC pyrolysis rather than harnessing the latent hydrocarbons in any form of energy. In order to simulate a real-world situation wherein the chlorine content is proficiently removed from waste PVC using affordable additives, the state-of-the-art online TG-IR-GCMS approach was used to examine the PVC thermal degradation products in the presence and absence of Ca(OH)2. In both cases, the TG analysis revealed twin degradation phases with the simultaneous IR spectral analysis verifying that the HCl release was limited to the first stage with a mass loss of ∼60%; most notably benzene being the other major product with 81.59% relative area as endorsed by GCMS analysis. In the second stage, further PVC chains unzipping generated several other aromatic products upon the Diels–Alder reactions of intramolecular cyclization such as toluene, xylene and other benzene derivatives. The PVC co-pyrolysis with Ca(OH)2 reduced the HCl formation significantly due to the dissociative adsorption of HCl gradually over the calcium surface converting Ca(OH)2 into calcium oxide and eventually into CaCl2 as verified by the XRD crystallinity analysis and surface morphology and elemental mapping via SEM-EDX analysis.
