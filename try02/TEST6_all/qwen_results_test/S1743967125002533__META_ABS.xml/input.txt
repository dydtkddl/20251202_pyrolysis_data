Ca-catalyzed co-pyrolysis behavior of biomass and waste plastics: A ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation and experiments study The co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics presents an innovative approach for high-value utilization. Alkaline-earth metal catalysts like CaO show significant promise in regulating product. This study employs reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations and thermogravimetric analysis to investigate the effect of pyrolysis conditions, calcium catalysis, and H2O presence in a biomass-plastics co-pyrolysis model. Results indicate a strong synergistic interaction between biomass and plastics, promoting benzene ring opening and accelerating cleavage of C–C and C=C bonds. This synergistic effect lowers the initial pyrolysis temperature, enhances macromolecular decomposition efficiency, and increases gas yield while reducing heavy-oil and char yields. Lower heating rates improve molecular decomposition, decreasing char yield and boosting gas yield. Calcium catalysts accelerate the cleavage of C–H and C–C bonds through their high cata-lytic activity, while facilitating hydrogen transfer between terminal H atoms in plastics and oxygen-containing functional groups in biomass, increasing gas yield. The model-free kinetic analysis shows that the addition of CaO reduced the average activation energy by approximately 5 %. However, calcium's catalytic activity diminishes at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Additionally, H2O generates ·H and ·OH reactive radicals that enhance gas-phase reactions, notably increasing H2 and CO yields through radical-mediated pathways. This study offers theoretical insights for the efficient and clean energy utilization of biomass and waste plastics.
