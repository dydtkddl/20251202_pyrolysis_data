You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ca-catalyzed co-pyrolysis behavior of biomass and waste plastics: A ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation and experiments study The co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics presents an innovative approach for high-value utilization. Alkaline-earth metal catalysts like CaO show significant promise in regulating product. This study employs reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations and thermogravimetric analysis to investigate the effect of pyrolysis conditions, calcium catalysis, and H2O presence in a biomass-plastics co-pyrolysis model. Results indicate a strong synergistic interaction between biomass and plastics, promoting benzene ring opening and accelerating cleavage of C–C and C=C bonds. This synergistic effect lowers the initial pyrolysis temperature, enhances macromolecular decomposition efficiency, and increases gas yield while reducing heavy-oil and char yields. Lower heating rates improve molecular decomposition, decreasing char yield and boosting gas yield. Calcium catalysts accelerate the cleavage of C–H and C–C bonds through their high cata-lytic activity, while facilitating hydrogen transfer between terminal H atoms in plastics and oxygen-containing functional groups in biomass, increasing gas yield. The model-free kinetic analysis shows that the addition of CaO reduced the average activation energy by approximately 5 %. However, calcium's catalytic activity diminishes at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Additionally, H2O generates ·H and ·OH reactive radicals that enhance gas-phase reactions, notably increasing H2 and CO yields through radical-mediated pathways. This study offers theoretical insights for the efficient and clean energy utilization of biomass and waste plastics.
