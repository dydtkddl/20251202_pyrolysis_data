Efficient biological funneling of lignin into 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid via electrocatalytic depolymerization and genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Lignin has been an abundant biomass resource with remarkable potential to produce value-added chemicals. The comprehensive process from lignin degradation to the biological conversion of its monomers remains a challenge for demonstrating the industrial applicability of lignin refinery. Herein, Pseudomonas putida KT-PDCV overexpressing homologous vanillate-O-methylase (VanAB) could efficiently produce 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) from lignin-derived compounds (LDC), including S-unit monomers (e.g., syringate and syringaldehyde). The engineered strain efficiently consumed syringate with other types of LDCs, such as p-coumarate and ferulate, and produced PDC up to 67.2 mM from mixed model lignin with a molar yield of 98 %. The efficient electrolyzer degraded practical lignin into the S-unit-dominant mixture of LDCs with remarkable performance. In addition, P. putida KT-PDCV directly utilized the mixture of LDCs without significant susceptibility to impurities, yielding a PDC of 0.91 mM with a molar yield of 62.3 %.
