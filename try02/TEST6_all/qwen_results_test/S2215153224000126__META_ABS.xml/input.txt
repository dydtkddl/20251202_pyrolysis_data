Upcycling of composite packaging waste to carbon nanotubes via chemicalvapor deposition of pyrolysis gas Based on the necessity of evaluating composite packaging wastes from both environmental and economic perspectives, it aimed to obtain carbon nanotube (CNT) from the pyrolysis gas product of this material by the catalytic chemical vapor deposition method (CCVD) via an upcycling approach. In the first stage, composite packaging wastes were pyrolyzed. Secondly, the composition of the gas via gas chromatography was determined. In the third stage, CNT production studies were carried out by the CCVD method in a tubular reactor at four different temperatures between 600 and 900 °C with nickel catalyst. The effects of temperature and carbon source feeding ratio on the properties of the obtained CNTs were investigated. CNTs produced in this study were compared with a commercial product. As a result, high-quality multi-walled carbon nanotube of 20–30 nm diameter and in micrometer scale length comparable to commercial products were produced from the gaseous product at 800 °C under Ni-catalysis.
