You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behaviors of four O-acetyl-preserved hemicelluloses isolated from hardwoods and softwoods The pyrolysis mechanisms of O-acetyl-preserved hemicelluloses isolated from both hardwoods and softwoods have been investigated. Their chemical structures, pyrolysis kinetics, pyrolytic product distributions, and pyrolytic gaseous evolutions have been systematically studied. Hardwood hemicellulose was mainly composed of 4-O-methyl-d-glucurono-d-xylan and had high contents of O-acetyl and uronic acid units, whereas softwood hemicelluloses were composed of d-galacto-d-gluco-d-mannan and l-arabino-4-O-methyl-d-glucurono-d-xylan. A double-Gaussian distributed activation energy model has been introduced to simulate the pyrolysis kinetics. Hardwood hemicellulose pyrolysis showed lower activation energies than softwood hemicellulose pyrolysis. Hardwood hemicellulose pyrolysis mainly yielded furfural and acids, whereas for softwood hemicellulose pyrolysis, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and anhydro sugars were typical products. The evolution behaviors of H2O, CO2, CO, and acids from the pyrolyzes of the four hemicelluloses are discussed.
