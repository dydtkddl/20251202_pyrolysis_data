You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Almond shells: Catalytic fixed-bed pyrolysis and volatilization kinetics The recovery of energy from lignocellulosic food residues provides a double beneficial effect on the mitigation of environmental issues: waste management and carbon-neutral fuels. In this work, almond shells were characterized by thermogravimetry to evaluate their potential for conversion into pyrolytic bio-oil. The average composition assessed by deconvolution of rate of thermal degradation curves (hemicellulose 40.9 wt%, cellulose 28.2 wt%, lignin 30.9 wt%) agrees with published data obtained using laborious conventional techniques. The same set of differential thermogravimetry data was used to estimate pyrolysis kinetics parameters using linear regression and curve-fitting methods, revealing parameters in the range of previously published data. The fixed-bed reactor pyrolysis of grounded almonds shells produced bio-oil in yields lower than 52 wt% for temperatures in the range 375–500 °C. The use of catalysts in pyrolysis tests, fluid catalytic cracking catalyst, Li and Na carbonates, and cenospheres had a beneficial effect on the bio-oil yield. Catalysts had also a positive effect on the bio-oil quality decreasing the acidic species. Cenospheres were the most performant material, being able to decrease the relative fraction of organic acid functional groups from 48 wt% to 21 wt% at 500 °C. Cenospheres are waste streams from coal power plants; this favorable behavior brings them to light as promising low-cost catalysts for biomass pyrolysis processes.
