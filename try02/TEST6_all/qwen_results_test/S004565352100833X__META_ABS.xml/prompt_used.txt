You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On-line detection and kinetic study of selenium release during combustion, gasification and pyrolysis of sawdust An on-line analysis system was firstly developed to quantitatively measure the temporal concentrations of selenium in the flue gas directly. Then the selenium release during air combustion, CO2/argon gasification, and argon pyrolysis of sawdust was systematically studied using the on-line analysis system, based on the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The peak of selenium concentration in the flue gas ranges from 0.38 to 1.76 mg∙Nm−3 with change of reaction temperature and atmosphere. The overall activation energy for selenium release is 75.3 kJ∙mol-1 in air combustion, 102.4 kJ∙mol-1 in CO2/argon gasification, and 81.9 kJ∙mol-1 in argon pyrolysis, respectively. The results show that the combustion atmosphere contributes to the selenium release more than that in gasification and pyrolysis. The promotion effect of chlorine on selenium release under combustion environment was one to three times higher than that under gasification and pyrolysis atmosphere. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculation showed that selenium oxides were the main gaseous selenium species in combustion, while the dominant gaseous selenium species were H2Se (g) and Se (g) under gasification/pyrolysis condition. The selenium release was increased with different degrees by additive chlorine species, mainly because of the formation of SeCl2 (g). The role of chlorine in selenium transformation has been provided in the proposed reaction pathways of selenium release, based on the new findings using on-line analysis system. The selenium species retained in sawdust can be transformed into selenium oxide (SeO2, SeO, corresponding to the combustion condition) and selenium hydride (H2Se, corresponding to the gasification/pyrolysis conditions).
