You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Decomposition of hydrocarbons to hydrogen and carbon This review assesses technologies and catalysts pertaining to the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons for the CO2-free generation of hydrogen for fuel cell applications through a single-step cracking (decomposition, decarbonization, dehydrogenation, pyrolysis, splitting, or dissociation) of hydrocarbons. It discusses and systematically categorizes the options for hydrocarbon decomposition to hydrogen and carbon. This decomposition helps to reduce green house gases by co-producing valuable carbon products such as carbon black or graphite-like carbon (carbon nanotubes or carbon filaments). The catalytic approach comprises metal and carbon-based catalysts while plasma-based decomposition depends on thermal or non-thermal methods. Almost all the proposed processes are applicable to a variety of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon fuels, and some of these processes can potentially produce a stream of high-purity hydrogen. There have been successful attempts to use catalysts to reduce the maximum temperature of the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. Common catalysts used are noble and transition metals such as Ni, Fe, Pd, Co, Mo, etc., supported on high surface area ceramic substrates such as A12O3 and SiO2, etc. Several other publications disclose the use of carbon-based materials as catalysts for decomposition of hydrocarbons into H2 and carbon. The other non-catalytic decomposition methods include non-thermal low-temperature plasmas such as RF (radio frequency), dc (direct current) generators, microwave plasmatrons, and arc plasma jet.
