You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Complementary use of generalized logistic mixture model and distributed activation energy model in exploring kinetic mechanisms of wheat straw and torrefied rice husk pyrolysis Lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis is a multi-step overlapping process, which leads to some difficulties in exploring biomass pyrolysis mechanisms. A kinetic approach combining the generalized logistic mixture model (GLMM) and the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) was proposed to explore the kinetic mechanisms of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis. The pyrolysis process of wheat straw could be effectively deconvoluted into three sub-processes by the GLMM, which corresponded to the thermal decomposition of pseudo-hemicellulose, pseudo-cellulose, and pseudo-lignin, respectively. These sub-processes could be adequately represented by the DAEMs and their activation energy distributions peaked at 164.2 kJ mol−1 (with a standard deviation of 2.6 kJ mol−1), 173.4 kJ mol−1 (with a standard deviation of 1.0 kJ mol−1) and 185.1 kJ mol−1 (with a standard deviation of 27.4 kJ mol−1). However, the pyrolysis process of torrefied rice husk was described by two sub-processes corresponding to the thermal decomposition of pseudo-cellulose and pseudo-lignin, with their activation energies peaked at 173.5 kJ mol−1 (with a standard deviation of 2.8 kJ mol−1) and 164.0 kJ mol−1 (with a standard deviation of 12.9 kJ mol−1). The combination of the GLMM and DAEM could provide a methodological guideline to obtain the detailed reactivity distributions involved in biomass pyrolysis, facilitating the optimization of biomass pyrolysis processes and subsequently extending the efficient and clean use of biomass for biofuel production.
