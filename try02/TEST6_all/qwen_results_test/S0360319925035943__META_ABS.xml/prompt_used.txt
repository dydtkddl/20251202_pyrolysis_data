You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing hydrogen production: The synergy of pretreatment and boron catalysts This study evaluates the production of hydrogen-rich synthesis gas from the energy crop Miscanthus x giganteus and municipal wastewater treatment sludge. The effects of biomass pretreatment, gasification conditions (temperature, catalyst content, and catalyst-to-biomass ratio), and hydrogen yield were investigated. Both catalytic and non-catalytic biomass steam gasification methods were explored. Catalytic biomass steam gasification employed a newly developed catalyst using boron-supported alkali-based materials and biomass feedstock, aiming to achieve a higher hydrogen gas composition in the product gas compared to non-catalytic steam gasification. The composition of syngas produced by biomass steam gasification was analyzed to determine the H2 and CO components, as well as other gas byproducts. The optimization study, utilizing the Box-Behnken Design, identified parameters influencing H2 generation and the catalytic impact on gasification efficiency. In catalytic gasification experiments using hydrochar derived from miscanthus as the model biomass, optimal conditions for H2 concentration were found to be 900 °C, 10.0 % boron content, and a biomass-to-catalyst ratio of 0.65. The results demonstrated a hydrogen content of 62.88 % in the product gas, highlighting the significant role of the catalyst in tar removal.
