You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemically enhanced activation of Co3O4/TiO2 nanotube array anode for persulfate toward high catalytic activity, low energy consumption, and long lifespan performance Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can directly degrade and mineralize organic pollutants (OPs) in water by generating reactive oxygen species with strong oxidizing ability. The development of advanced electrode materials with high catalytic performance, low energy consumption, no secondary pollution, and long lifespan has become a challenge that must be addressed in this field. A heterojunction catalyst loaded with Co3O4 on TDNAs (Co3O4/RTDNAs) was designed and constructed by a simple and efficient pyrolysis (Co3O4/TDNAs) and electrochemical reduction. Co3O4 can be uniformly distributed on the inner wall and surface of the TiO2 nanotubes, enhancing the specific surface area while forming a tight conductive interface with TiO2. This facilitates rapid transmission of electrons, thereby assisting Co3O4 in quickly activating PS to form reactive oxygen species. The Ti3+ and Ov generated in Co3O4/RTDNAs can significantly improve the electrocatalytic degradation of OPs. Also, the interface formed by Co3O4 and RTDNAs will effectively suppress Co2+ leakage, thereby reducing the risk of secondary pollution. When the reaction conditions were 1 mM PMS (PDS) and a current density of 5 mA/cm2 in the EA-PMS (PDS)/Co3O4/RTDNA system, 30 mg/L TC can achieve 83.24 % (81.89 %) removal in 120 min, with very low cobalt ion leaching, while the energy consumption was reduced significantly. Therefore, EA-PS/Co3O4/RTDNA system has strong stability and a high potential for treating the OPs in AOPs.
