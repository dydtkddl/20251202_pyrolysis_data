You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A state of art review on recycling and remanufacturing of the carbon fiber from carbon fiber polymer composite Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFRPC) are commonly used in various applications like sports, aviation, transportation, and the building sector. In particular, CFRPC preparations (intermediate products) are employed in CFRPC manufacturing, with much waste being generated through fabrications procedures and after its life cycle. Recovering of the carbon fiber from the waste of the CFRPC is a serious challenge for the renewable energy division. This paper describes an advances in the different recycling techniques of the recycled carbon fiber from the carbon fiber polymer composites and re-manufacturing of the recovered carbon fiber from the recycling technique into three-dimensional printed composite products. Physical and mechanical properties of the recovered carbon fiber printed using the different polymers matrix materials have been discussed. The aim of this paper also includes present problems and developments in the disposal and reuse of fiber-reinforced composites. Overall, the research presented in this paper gives valuable insights into the recycling techniques of carbon fiber and remanufacturing of the recovered carbon fiber for society's long-term development. After a thorough review of the available literature, study gaps are identified in order to determine future paths in this work.
