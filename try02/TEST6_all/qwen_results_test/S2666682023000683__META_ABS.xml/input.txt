A state of art review on recycling and remanufacturing of the carbon fiber from carbon fiber polymer composite Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFRPC) are commonly used in various applications like sports, aviation, transportation, and the building sector. In particular, CFRPC preparations (intermediate products) are employed in CFRPC manufacturing, with much waste being generated through fabrications procedures and after its life cycle. Recovering of the carbon fiber from the waste of the CFRPC is a serious challenge for the renewable energy division. This paper describes an advances in the different recycling techniques of the recycled carbon fiber from the carbon fiber polymer composites and re-manufacturing of the recovered carbon fiber from the recycling technique into three-dimensional printed composite products. Physical and mechanical properties of the recovered carbon fiber printed using the different polymers matrix materials have been discussed. The aim of this paper also includes present problems and developments in the disposal and reuse of fiber-reinforced composites. Overall, the research presented in this paper gives valuable insights into the recycling techniques of carbon fiber and remanufacturing of the recovered carbon fiber for society's long-term development. After a thorough review of the available literature, study gaps are identified in order to determine future paths in this work.
