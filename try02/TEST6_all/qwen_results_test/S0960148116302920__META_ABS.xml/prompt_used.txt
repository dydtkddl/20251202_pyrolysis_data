You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insitu upgradation of biocrude vapor generated from non-edible oil cake's hydrothermal conversion over aluminated mesoporous catalysts In this work, biocrude vapors generated from hydrothermal conversion of Pongammia pinnata cake using high pressure reactor at 400 °C and 25 kg/cm2 were upgraded over three mesoporous catalyst namely SBA-15, KIT-6 and FDU-12. The catalysts were synthesized, aluminated and characterized using X-Ray Diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM techniques. A decrease in the surface area was observed on all three mesoporous catalyst after alumina loading with negligible effect on the pore diameter. Purely siliceous catalysts were found to give negligible effect on the yield of different product phases. Alumina supported SBA-15 (SAR 30) was observed as the suitable catalyst as compared to Al/FDU-12 (SAR 30) and Al/KIT-6 (SAR 30) for maximizing the biocrude yield with low heavy hydrocarbons (46.3 ± 2.2%), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (17.1%) and acidic compounds (9.1%) content. Therefore series of SBA-15 were synthesized by varying silicon to alumina ratio between 20 and 50 for maximizing hydrocarbons with boiling cut fractions between 195 and 317 °C corresponding to gasoline range hydrocarbons. Al/SBA-15(SAR 40) was found to give highest biocrude yield (∼34.8%) with highest selectivity towards gasoline fraction (23.7 ± 1.9%). GC/MS analysis was used to confirm the presence of aliphatic and aromatics. Highest asphaltene content was observed with Al/SBA-15 (SAR 50).
