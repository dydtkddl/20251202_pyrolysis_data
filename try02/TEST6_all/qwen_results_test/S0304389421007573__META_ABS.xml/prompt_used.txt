You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Double-edged effects of polyvinyl chloride addition on heavy metal separation and biochar production during pyrolysis of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator Pyrolysis is a promising technique to achieve the sustainable utilization of heavy metal hyperaccumulator derived from phytoremediation of contaminated soils. To investigate the feasibility of synergistic treatment of hyperaccumulator and plastic waste (i.e. polyvinyl chloride, PVC), co-pyrolysis of Sedum alfredii and different mass percentages of PVC (5–25 wt%) was conducted at 300–900 °C in the present study. High pyrolysis temperature and low PVC addition amount (5 wt%) effectively promoted the volatilization of Cd and Zn from S. alfredii, while high PVC addition amount (15 wt% and 25 wt%) caused a significant suppression effect at insufficient pyrolysis temperatures. After PVC addition, the yields of biochar increased by 5.18–37.19% as compared with the theoretical values. However, the concentrations of Cd and Zn leached from biochar significantly elevated with increasing PVC addition amount, indicating that the addition of PVC improved the mobility of Cd and Zn in biochar. Moreover, S. alfredii derived biochars showed considerable sorption capacity for Cd (87.6–198.3 mg/g). These results imply that the addition of PVC has double-edged effects on heavy metal separation and biochar production during pyrolysis of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator, and low PVC addition amount and sufficient pyrolysis temperature are beneficial for the further utilization of biochar.
