You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experiments and modeling of octanoic acid pyrolysis in a plug flow reactor Pyrolysis of carboxylic acids plays a key role in various industrial applications (production of bio-energy vectors from waste cooking oil reforming or of biosourced chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis, or even combustion of ethyl biodiesel). In this work, pyrolysis of octanoic acid selected as departure model compound was carried out in a plug flow reactor. Profiles of the reactant, stable intermediates, and final products, identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, were measured by non-dispersive infrared absorption and gas chromatography equipped with thermal conductivity detector or flame ionization detector. Within the operating conditions of the plug flow reactor (mean pressure/kPa: 112; oven set point temperature/K: 923–1073, mean residence times/s: 0.42-0.83; reactant mole fraction in nitrogen selected as inert diluent: 3 and 5%), the major products formed are 1-olefins and carboxylic acids (saturated and monounsaturated) together with small species like hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and ethylene. These experimental data were used to further develop a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for octanoic acid pyrolysis, mainly generated from EXGAS software with kinetic and thermodynamic properties of key reactions specific to carboxylic acids revisited. Satisfactory repeatability and material balances were obtained for the generated kinetic data, which also showed a satisfactory agreement with the proposed mechanism. Rate of production and sensitivity analyses were carried out for selected experimental conditions (high temperature and various residence times), highlighting the significant contribution of H-abstractions (particularly the α-hydrogens) and the sensitive key role of the unimolecular decomposition in octanoic acid consumption.
