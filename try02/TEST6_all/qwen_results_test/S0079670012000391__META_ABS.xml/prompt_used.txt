You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biocomposites reinforced with natural fibers: 2000–2010 Due to environment and sustainability issues, this century has witnessed remarkable achievements in green technology in the field of materials science through the development of biocomposites. The development of high-performance materials made from natural resources is increasing worldwide. The greatest challenge in working with natural fiber reinforced plastic composites is their large variation in properties and characteristics. A biocomposite's properties are influenced by a number of variables, including the fiber type, environmental conditions (where the plant fibers are sourced), processing methods, and any modification of the fiber. It is also known that recently there has been a surge of interest in the industrial applications of composites containing biofibers reinforced with biopolymers. Biopolymers have seen a tremendous increase in use as a matrix for biofiber reinforced composites. A comprehensive review of literature (from 2000 to 2010) on the mostly readily utilized natural fibers and biopolymers is presented in this paper. The overall characteristics of reinforcing fibers used in biocomposites, including source, type, structure, composition, as well as mechanical properties, will be reviewed. Moreover, the modification methods; physical (corona and plasma treatment) and chemical (silane, alkaline, acetylation, maleated coupling, and enzyme treatment) will be discussed. The most popular matrices in biofiber reinforced composites based on petrochemical and renewable resources will also be addressed. The wide variety of biocomposite processing techniques as well as the factors (moisture content, fiber type and content, coupling agents and their influence on composites properties) affecting these processes will be discussed. Prior to the processing of biocomposites, semi-finished product manufacturing is also vital, which will be illustrated. Processing technologies for biofiber reinforced composites will be discussed based on thermoplastic matrices (compression molding, extrusion, injection molding, LFT-D-method, and thermoforming), and thermosets (resin transfer molding, sheet molding compound). Other implemented processes, i.e., thermoset compression molding and pultrusion and their influence on mechanical performance (tensile, flexural and impact properties) will also be evaluated. Finally, the review will conclude with recent developments and future trends of biocomposites as well as key issues that need to be addressed and resolved.
