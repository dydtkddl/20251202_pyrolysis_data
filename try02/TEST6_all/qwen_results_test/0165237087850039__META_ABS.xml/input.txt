Kinetics and mechanism of the vapor phase pyrolysis of 1,3-dioxolane in steam The kinetics and mechanism of 1,3-dioxolane pyrolysis were determined in atmospheric pressure steam between 963 K and 1093 K with reactant concentrations of 6.28·10−7 to 1.36·10−4 mol/l using a flow reactor. The reaction was found to be first order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant is given by ln k=27.6±3.2−(51,300± 6,500)/RT which agrees well with previous literature data. Some mechanistic aspects of levoglucosan pyrolysis are considered in light of these dioxolaneresults and recently published results on the pyrolysis of glycerol.
