You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Environmental life cycle assessment of biomass conversion using hydrothermal technology: A review Renewable resources such as biomass are essential in increasing energy security and enabling countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass can be converted into biochar, bio-oil (clean fuel), and valuable chemicals using a thermochemical process. Among thermochemical approaches, hydrothermal technology such as hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, and hydrothermal gasification are gaining research interest due to their cost-effectiveness, environmentally-friendly method, and produce high product yield. Hydrothermal technology is developed to transform different types of wet biomass into value-added products such as biochar or hydrochar, bio-oil, and syngas. This systematic review aims to describe hydrothermal technology and the life cycle assessment (LCA) of hydrothermal biomass conversion. Firstly, a systematic review of hydrothermal technology and LCA was carried out using the PRISMA method to analyze publication trends, current research developments, hot topics, and knowledge gaps. Secondly, this review presents the fundamental concept of hydrothermal technology and summarizes the up-to-date technology on hydrothermal carbonization, liquefaction, and gasification. Next, LCA guidelines and the current progress on LCA of biomass conversion using hydrothermal technology are discussed. In addition, the available literature that related to techno-economic evaluation of the hydrothermal process is reviewed. Currently, very limited study has reported on the environmental and economic impacts of hydrothermal biomass conversion. Therefore, to provide a sustainable and green process that can be applied in a commercial plant, a study on environmental impact is critical to show the benefits of biomass hydrothermal processing. This review also presents a step-by-step guideline for beginners and researchers to venture into this field to understand the LCA framework. Transfer of success in lab-scale to large-scale setups (industrial) demands consideration of several criteria, as well as careful and holistic analyses such as the environmental impacts of the overall process from feedstock (biomass) to final process (product).
