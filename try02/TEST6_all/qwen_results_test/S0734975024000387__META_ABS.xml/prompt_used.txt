You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Harnessing recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass for enhanced biohydrogen production: Recent advances, challenges, and future perspective Biohydrogen (Bio-H2) is widely recognized as a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source, devoid of any detrimental impact on the environment. Lignocellulosic biomass (LB) is a readily accessible and plentiful source material that can be effectively employed as a cost-effective and sustainable substrate for Bio-H2 production. Despite the numerous challenges, the ongoing progress in LB pretreatment technology, microbial fermentation, and the integration of molecular biology techniques have the potential to enhance Bio-H2 productivity and yield. Consequently, this technology exhibits efficiency and the capacity to meet the future energy demands associated with the valorization of recalcitrant biomass. To date, several pretreatment approaches have been investigated in order to improve the digestibility of feedstock. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of comprehensive systematic studies examining the effectiveness of pretreatment methods in enhancing Bio-H2 production through dark fermentation. Additionally, there is a dearth of economic feasibility evaluations pertaining to this area of research. Thus, this review has conducted comparative studies on the technological and economic viability of current pretreatment methods. It has also examined the potential of these pretreatments in terms of carbon neutrality and circular economy principles. This review paves the way for a new opportunity to enhance Bio-H2 production with technological approaches.
