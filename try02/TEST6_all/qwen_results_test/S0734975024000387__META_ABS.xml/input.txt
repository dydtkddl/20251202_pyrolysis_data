Harnessing recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass for enhanced biohydrogen production: Recent advances, challenges, and future perspective Biohydrogen (Bio-H2) is widely recognized as a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source, devoid of any detrimental impact on the environment. Lignocellulosic biomass (LB) is a readily accessible and plentiful source material that can be effectively employed as a cost-effective and sustainable substrate for Bio-H2 production. Despite the numerous challenges, the ongoing progress in LB pretreatment technology, microbial fermentation, and the integration of molecular biology techniques have the potential to enhance Bio-H2 productivity and yield. Consequently, this technology exhibits efficiency and the capacity to meet the future energy demands associated with the valorization of recalcitrant biomass. To date, several pretreatment approaches have been investigated in order to improve the digestibility of feedstock. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of comprehensive systematic studies examining the effectiveness of pretreatment methods in enhancing Bio-H2 production through dark fermentation. Additionally, there is a dearth of economic feasibility evaluations pertaining to this area of research. Thus, this review has conducted comparative studies on the technological and economic viability of current pretreatment methods. It has also examined the potential of these pretreatments in terms of carbon neutrality and circular economy principles. This review paves the way for a new opportunity to enhance Bio-H2 production with technological approaches.
