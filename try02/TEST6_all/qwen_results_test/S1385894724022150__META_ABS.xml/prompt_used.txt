You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Detailed insights of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) degradation mechanism via ReaxFF MD and experiments Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) serves as a widely used silicone polymer in ablative thermal protection material. Nevertheless, the intricate degradation mechanism governing PDMS at ultra-high temperatures remains unclear. Herein, PDMS pyrolysis was in-depth investigated by employing a combination of experimental methodologies and ReaxFF molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations. PDMS model was firstly validated by product distribution analysis and kinetics analysis. Molecular reaction tracking unveils that the pyrolysis pathway primarily is triggered by the cleavage of the Si-C bond, leading to cyclization reactions and fractures within the Si-O framework at elevated temperatures. The pathways leading to the formation of gaseous, liquid, and solid products during thermal cracking are systematically unveiled. Drawing from these insights, DFT calculations reveal Si-C bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of 98.8, 102.2, and 108.2 kcal/mol for Si-CH3, Si-C2H3, and Si-C6H5, respectively. MD simulations further indicate that the heightened Si-C BDEs across various silicone rubbers impede their decomposition, thereby augmenting the thermal stability of the material. This study augments our comprehension of the PDMS pyrolysis mechanism and offers theoretical insights for enhancing its thermal stability.
