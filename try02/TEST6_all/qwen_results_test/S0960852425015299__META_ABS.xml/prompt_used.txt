You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphene production from lignin via catalytic graphitization Graphene-based materials are promising building blocks in nanotechnology due to their wide range of applications. This work focuses on a bottom-up approach in which graphene is obtained from lignin as an alternative carbon source, despite its high oxygen content. Studies on the reaction mechanisms governing graphene formation from lignin are scarce, and no reviews have been found on this topic, which highlights the novelty of the subject and the need for further research to support its development. The extent of graphitic domain formation depends mainly on parameters such as heating rate, annealing temperature, residence time, cooling rate, precursor characteristics, catalyst size and distribution, contact time between precursor and catalyst before annealing, and the presence and location of heteroatoms in the raw material. These factors are directly linked to key performance indicators of graphene quality (crystallinity, defect density, electrical conductivity, and structural homogeneity), which determine its suitability for advanced applications. Recent advances in conversion technologies make lignin-derived graphene a promising alternative. Scaling up lignin-to-graphene conversion requires addressing challenges related to cost-effectiveness, consistency, and product quality. This review highlights the key process factors that influence graphene quality and the barriers to industrial implementation. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of the chemical evolution of lignin during catalytic pyrolysis for efficient graphene production, examines the catalytic pathways and transformation mechanisms involved, and defines the structure–property relationships essential for optimizing graphene yield and quality.
