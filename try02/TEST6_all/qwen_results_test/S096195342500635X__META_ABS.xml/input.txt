Optimization of biodiesel production: A comparative study of methyl and ethyl esters from pyrolytic oil Biodiesel derived from non-edible and waste biomass sources offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels while addressing energy security and environmental concerns. Among these, pyrolytic oil from agricultural residues such as Albizia saman pods remains underexplored for fuel production despite its abundance and potential. However, limited comparative studies exist on the efficiency and emissions performance of methyl and ethyl esters derived from such pyrolytic oils. This study aims to optimize and evaluate biodiesel blends produced through methanolysis and ethanolysis of Albizia saman pyrolytic oil in a single-cylinder CI engine. A two-stage process involving acid esterification and base-catalyzed transesterification was employed, followed by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize blend ratio and engine load. Key findings reveal that MB20 achieved a higher brake thermal efficiency of 30.04 % and lower BSFC of 0.50 kg/kW-hr at full load compared to EB20, which recorded a BTE of 29.04 % and BSFC of 0.55 kg/kW-hr. Emission analysis showed that MB20 significantly reduced CO and HC emissions by 19.2 % and 33.3 %, respectively, compared to diesel. These results demonstrate that methyl esters from pyrolytic oil are promising candidates for clean combustion with minor NOx trade-offs. The study underscores the viability of converting agro-waste into renewable fuel and encourages further research on emission reduction technologies, feedstock variability management, and lifecycle assessments to support large-scale implementation.
