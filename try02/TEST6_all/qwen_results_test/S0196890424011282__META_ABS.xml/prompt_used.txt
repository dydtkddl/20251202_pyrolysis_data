You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive assessment of Integrating anaerobic digestion and hydrothermal liquefaction Processes: Harnessing energy from sewage sludge Integrating anaerobic digestion (AD) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) offers a promising approach for efficient sewage sludge management and enhanced energy recovery. This study systematically evaluates the energy recovery efficiency of two sequencing configurations: HTL followed by AD and AD followed by HTL, at varying HTL operating conditions of 250, 300, and 350 °C for 30 and 60 min each. Our results demonstrate that the HTL-AD sequence yields higher energy recovery in the form of biocrude, with a significant concentration of fatty acids due to the high lipid content in primary sludge. Conversely, the AD-HTL sequence recovers more energy in the form of biomethane, attributed to the easily degradable nature of primary sludge with lower nitrogen content. Energy recovery for the HTL-AD sequence ranges from 47.2 % to 84.5 %, while the AD-HTL sequence ranges from 57.2 % to 77.3 %. The HTL-AD system recovers the highest energy at 300 °C for 60 min, whereas at other operating conditions, the AD-HTL system achieves higher energy recovery than the HTL-AD system. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing sewage sludge valorization processes and advancing toward a sustainable circular bioeconomy. Future research should focus on long-term stability, economic feasibility, and scalability assessments of these integrated systems.
