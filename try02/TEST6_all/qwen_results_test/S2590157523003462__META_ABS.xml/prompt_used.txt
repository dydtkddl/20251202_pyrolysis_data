You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of palm residues for biochar production using continuous flow pyrolysis unit Biochar is a carbonaceous solid substance produced by heating biomass without using air. This research aimed to create and evaluate local carbonization pyrolysis using a screw conveyor and filtration equipment. Date palm frond (DPF) biochar was studied and tested at pyrolysis temperatures of 320, 390, and 460 °C, as well as feeding rates of 60, 90, and 120 kg/h. The physicochemical parameters of DPF biochar were evaluated using SEM and FTIR. When the pyrolysis temperature was raised from 320 to 450 °C, and the feed rates were reduced from 120 to 60 kg/h, the biochar yield of DPF and volatiles fell. At 460 °C and 60 kg/h, the maximum ash and fixed carbon content were 11.73 and 77.61 %, respectively. As the feed rate decreased and the temperature increased, the H and O values (1.96 and 2.62 %, respectively) of DPF biochar decreased considerably; the C and N values (83.60 and 0.24 %, respectively) trended inopposite directions. The BET surface area and pore volume increased as a result of the micropore surface area and volume at higher temperatures and lower feeding rates, but water holding capacity increased from 6.04 gwater/10 g at 320 °C to 6.78 gwater/10 g at 390 °C (60 kg/h). The results showed that the heating temperature increased and the feeding rate decreased; phosphorus) P(and magnesium (Mg) increased significantly, whereas the levels of potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) showed a non-significant increase. Furthermore, as the pyrolysis temperature increased, pH and EC increased from 7.90 to 10.96 and 2.91 to 4.25 dSm−1, respectively, while CEC declined; however, there were no significant changes in CEC. DPF biochar demonstrated enhanced macro porosity and surface area at 460 °C and 60 kg/h, making it acceptable for agricultural use as a soil supplement.
