You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon molecular sieve membranes derived from UV-irradiated polyimides for enhanced molecular separation and physical aging resistance Herein, we present an approach for adjusting the pore structure of carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes by controlling UV irradiation on polyimide (PI) precursors. CMS dense membranes were fabricated by pyrolyzing UV-crosslinkable PIs synthesized from 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA), 3,3′,4,4′-benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), and 2,4-diamino mesitylene (DAM). Increasing UV irradiation time enhanced molecular sieving performance while decreasing gas permeability. At the highest UV irradiation time of 40 min, the gas selectivities for H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 improved 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, H2 and CO2 permeabilities decreased by ∼9 % and ∼30 % relative to the pristine CMS membrane, both deviating notably from the upper bound slope trends. Gas diffusivity and pore size distribution analyses suggested that these improvements stemmed from a reduction in larger ultramicropores. Furthermore, a prolonged CO2/CH4 mixed-gas permeation test (170 days) showed that pre-crosslinked CMS membranes demonstrated enhanced resistance to physical aging. After the aging period, the pre-crosslinked CMS membranes showed slightly higher mixed-gas CO2 permeability and ∼2 times higher mixed-gas CO2/CH4 selectivity than pristine CMS. This study introduces a novel method for tuning the CMS microstructure to produce more selective and aging-resistant carbon membranes.
