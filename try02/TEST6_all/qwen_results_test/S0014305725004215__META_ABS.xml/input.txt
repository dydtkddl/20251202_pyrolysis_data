A CFRP recycling strategy of integrating catalytic hydrolysis and catalyst-involved high-value reutilization of degradation products The escalating accumulation of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) waste and the limitations of conventional recycling methods demand innovative strategies to achieve full-component recovery and sustainable valorization. CFRP waste is hard to recycle because of its dense physical/chemical structure and solvent resistance, especially in aqueous solvent degradation systems. Here, we report a CFRP recycling strategy that integrates catalytic hydrolysis and high-value reuse of degradation products. The FeCl3 catalytic system enables efficient hydrolysis and slightly oxidative degradation of the epoxy thermosets in CFRP. High-performance adhesives can be produced through the supramolecular interactions between iron ions and degradation products without the need of separation process. Simultaneously, carbon fibers (CFs) are recovered with minimal surface damage. This strategy not only addresses CFRP waste management challenges but also converts both polymer matrix and catalyst residues into value-added materials, offering a scalable and eco-friendly solution for circular composites economy.
