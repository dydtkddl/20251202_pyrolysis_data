You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in improving lignocellulosic biomass-based bio-oil production Developing pyrolysis technology to produce bio-oil from lignocellulosic biomass is a promising pathway for diversifying energy supply and controlling carbon emissions. Improving bio-oil production is a key research topic due to low-quality and low cost feedstock, and high demand for products. Understanding the multiscale complexity in the conversion process including biomass structure and the interactive reactions is crucial for designing a feasible and cost-effective pyrolysis process. This review provides a fundamental summary for the current knowledge. Biomass structure and its pyrolysis behaviors are firstly discussed to understand fundamental reaction chemistry in this process. Effects of pyrolysis process parameters on product yield and distribution are then reviewed. By analyzing recent studies, effects of different pretreatment techniques including torrefaction, hydrothermal pretreatment, and acid pretreatment on improving bio-oil production are reviewed. An emphasis is placed on the advanced catalytic pyrolysis for selective production of valuable products. Based on zeolite and metal oxide catalysts, chemical compositions of bio-oils can be more clearly understood and selective production of desirable products is more reliable. Co-pyrolysis of biomass with polymers to improve the bio-oil yield and quality is also summarized. The challenges and future research directions for effective pyrolysis processes are also proposed, which may lead to future important breakthroughs.
