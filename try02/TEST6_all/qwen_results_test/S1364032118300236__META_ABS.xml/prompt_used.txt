You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on utilization of wood biomass as a sustainable precursor for activated carbon production and application Activated carbon has been an ideal material for the separation of a variety of chemical pollutants. Its extensive use is limited due to the cost of production, which has triggered the researches on the viable option for the non-conventional and cost-effective production. The application of biomass waste has been widely explored as an alternative to expensive methods of activated carbon production from coal. In this study, detailed list of production methods of activated carbon from wood biomass is presented systematically. The attempt has also been made to review the physical properties, such as ultimate and proximate analyses of wood biomass material. Further, the chemical compositions of wood, such as hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin are also dealt with. Finally, this review incorporates the existing research papers on wood-derived activated carbons to understand the influence of pyrolysis temperature, activation temperature, and effect of various physical and chemical activation conditions on the production, surface characteristics and adsorption behavior of activated carbons. The outcome of this study revealed that the activated carbons from wood biomass exhibit promising characteristics in terms of surface area, pore size and pore volume, surface functional groups, and surface entrapment behavior against various water soluble chemical toxicants.
