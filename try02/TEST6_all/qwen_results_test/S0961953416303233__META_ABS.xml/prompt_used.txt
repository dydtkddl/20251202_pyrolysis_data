You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemometric analysis of composition of bio-crude and aqueous phase from hydrothermal liquefaction of thermally and chemically pretreated Miscanthus x giganteus Bio-crude from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignocellulosic biomass is a potential alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Continuous HTL of lignocellulosic biomass requires feedstock pretreatment to obtain pumpable slurries. This work extends upon previous evaluations of pretreatment methods for obtaining stable slurries of Miscanthus х giganteus. In the current study, extensive characterization of the bio-crude and aqueous phase from HTL of thermally and chemically pretreated M. х giganteus is reported and molecular differences of these samples are evaluated. The bio-crude and aqueous phase is characterized with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using pre-derivatization with silylating reagent and methyl chloroformate, respectively. Principal component analysis shows that bio-crudes of untreated and slurry stabilized samples have higher concentrations of small organic acids and fatty acids, samples pretreated at mild alkali conditions have higher concentrations of alcohols, polyaromatics, and methylated phenolics, and samples pretreated with strong alkali conditions have higher concentrations of cyclic oxygenates and ketonized aromatics. Aqueous phases are separated based on the addition of slurry stabilizer which has higher concentrations of dicarboxylic acids and phenol. The detailed exploration of both bio-crude and aqueous phase will be of interest for other investigations of the pretreatment effects on biomass for hydrothermal liquefaction.
