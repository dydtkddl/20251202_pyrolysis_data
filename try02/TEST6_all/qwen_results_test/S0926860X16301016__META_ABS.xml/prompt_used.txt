You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pt supported nitrogen doped hollow carbon spheres for the catalysed reduction of cinnamaldehyde Carbon and nitrogen coated Stöber silica spheres were prepared by a standard procedure using acetonitrile at different CVD temperatures (800–1000°C) and as a function of time (1–4h). HF treatment was used to remove the silica from the carbon coated silica to give monodispersed nitrogen doped hollow carbon spheres (N-HCSs; shell thickness=50nm). The surface areas of the N-CSs increased significantly after removal of the SiO2 core (N-HCS=47m2/g). Platinum nanoparticles, prepared by a [Pt(COD)Cl2] deposition method were dispersed (d=2.8±0.4nm) on the N-HCS supports. Thermal treatment of the Pt/N-HCS900-4 (prepared at 900°C for 4h) in a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere at 120°C (Pt/N-HCS900-4-120) and 300°C (Pt/N-HCS900-4-300) gave metallic Pt (2.48%) which was confirmed by XRD and XPS studies. The XPS N1s spectra of Pt/N-HCS900-4-120 showed the presence of quaternary, pyridinic and pyrollic nitrogen atoms. These nitrogen doped carbon supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts were observed to reduce cinnamaldehyde to the unsaturated alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol (isopropanol/30bar H2/80°C) with >99% conversion and selectivity. The catalyst used in the reduction of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol could be recycled 12 times with minimal loss in conversion and this correlated with the small amount of Pt leaching or physical loss of catalyst (<2%). The corresponding Pt/catalyst made on undoped HCSs showed a much greater loss of activity with recycling. It is seen that N doping of carbon is an effective method to bind Pt to carbon.
