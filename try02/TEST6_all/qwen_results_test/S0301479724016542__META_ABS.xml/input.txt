An in-depth study of the oxidative liquefaction process for polymeric waste reduction and chemical production from wind turbine blades and personal protective equipment used in the medical field An in-depth study of the oxidative liquefaction process has been provided to degrade the polymeric waste from personal protective equipment (PPEs) and wind turbine blades (WTBs). Thermogravimetric investigations demonstrate that WTBs have three prominent peaks throughout the degradation, whereas PPEs display solitary peak features. Experiments are carried out employing specific experimental design approaches, namely the Central Composite Face-Centered Plan (CCF) for WTBs and the Central Composition Design with Fractional Factorial Design for PPEs in a batch-type reactor at temperature ranges of 250–350 °C, pressures of 20–40 bar, residence times of 30–90 min, H2O2 concentrations of 15–45 %, and waste/liquid ratios of 5–25 % for WTBs. These values were 200–300 °C, 30 bar, 45 min, 30–60 % and 5–7 % for PPE. A detailed comparison has been provided in the context of total polymer degradation (TPD) for PPE and WTBs. Liquid products from both types of wastes after the oxidative liquefaction process are subjected to gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) to identify the existence of oxygenated chemical compounds (OCCs). For WTBs, TPD was 20–49 % and this value was 55–96 % for PPE while the OCC yield for WTBs (36.31 g/kg - 210.59 g/kg) and PPEs (39.93 g/kg - 212.66 g/kg) was also calculated. Detailed optimization of experimental plans was carried out by performing the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and optimization goals were maximum TPD and OCCs yields against the minimum energy consumption, though a considerable amount of complex polymer waste can be reduced and high concentrations of OCC can be achieved, which could be applied for commercial and environmental benefits.
