Sustainable aviation fuels from biomass and biowaste via bio- and chemo-catalytic conversion: Catalysis, process challenges, and opportunities Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production from biomass and biowaste streams is an attractive option for decarbonizing the aviation sector, one of the most-difficult-to-electrify transportation sectors. Despite ongoing commercialization efforts using ASTM-certified pathways (e.g., lipid conversion, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis), production capacities are still inadequate due to limited feedstock supply and high production costs. New conversion technologies that utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks are needed to meet these challenges and satisfy the rapidly growing market. Combining bio- and chemo-catalytic approaches can leverage advantages from both methods, i.e., high product selectivity via biological conversion, and the capability to build C-C chains more efficiently via chemical catalysis. Herein, conversion routes, catalysis, and processes for such pathways are discussed, while key challenges and meaningful R&D opportunities are identified to guide future research activities in the space. Bio- and chemo-catalytic conversion primarily utilize the carbohydrate fraction of lignocellulose, leaving lignin as a waste product. This makes lignin conversion to SAF critical in order to utilize whole biomass, thereby lowering overall production costs while maximizing carbon efficiencies. Thus, lignin valorization strategies are also reviewed herein with vital research areas identified, such as facile lignin depolymerization approaches, highly integrated conversion systems, novel process configurations, and catalysts for the selective cleavage of aryl C–O bonds. The potential efficiency improvements available via integrated conversion steps, such as combined biological and chemo-catalytic routes, along with the use of different parallel pathways, are identified as key to producing all components of a cost-effective, 100% SAF.
