Revolutionizing 3D printing: Unleashing the power of conductive polymers for next-gen biomedical applications The advancement of additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the development of conductive platforms, which are now integral to a wide range of industries, including biomedical engineering, electronics, energy storage, and materials science. By enabling the fabrication of complex geometries with precise control over material properties, modern 3D printing technologies have opened new avenues for designing materials that exhibit exceptional electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Conductive materials, particularly polymers, have become central to innovations in tissue engineering, wearable electronics, and bioelectronic devices due to their biocompatibility and ability to interface with biological systems. This article provides an in-depth review of the various 3D printing techniques used for producing conductive materials, including light-based methods, inkjet printing, and extrusion-based processes. Each method is analyzed for its advantages, limitations, and suitability for different applications. Additionally, we explore the unique properties of conductive polymers such as PEDOT, polyaniline (PANI), and polypyrrole (PPy), highlighting their synthesis methods and the challenges associated with their use in additive manufacturing. The review also addresses the latest advancements in printing techniques and materials optimization, aiming to improve scalability, performance, and integration of conductive platforms in emerging technologies. Finally, future research directions are discussed, with an emphasis on overcoming current limitations related to material processing, biocompatibility, and the production of highly functionalized conductive structures for next-generation applications.
