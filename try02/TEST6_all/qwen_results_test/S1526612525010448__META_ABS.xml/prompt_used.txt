You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Revolutionizing 3D printing: Unleashing the power of conductive polymers for next-gen biomedical applications The advancement of additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the development of conductive platforms, which are now integral to a wide range of industries, including biomedical engineering, electronics, energy storage, and materials science. By enabling the fabrication of complex geometries with precise control over material properties, modern 3D printing technologies have opened new avenues for designing materials that exhibit exceptional electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Conductive materials, particularly polymers, have become central to innovations in tissue engineering, wearable electronics, and bioelectronic devices due to their biocompatibility and ability to interface with biological systems. This article provides an in-depth review of the various 3D printing techniques used for producing conductive materials, including light-based methods, inkjet printing, and extrusion-based processes. Each method is analyzed for its advantages, limitations, and suitability for different applications. Additionally, we explore the unique properties of conductive polymers such as PEDOT, polyaniline (PANI), and polypyrrole (PPy), highlighting their synthesis methods and the challenges associated with their use in additive manufacturing. The review also addresses the latest advancements in printing techniques and materials optimization, aiming to improve scalability, performance, and integration of conductive platforms in emerging technologies. Finally, future research directions are discussed, with an emphasis on overcoming current limitations related to material processing, biocompatibility, and the production of highly functionalized conductive structures for next-generation applications.
