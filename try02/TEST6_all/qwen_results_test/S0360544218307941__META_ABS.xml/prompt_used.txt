You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of central composite design in the optimization of lipid yield from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae by ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction The production of carbon-neutral, renewable, and environment-friendly biofuels is currently being implemented worldwide to mitigate the excessive use of petroleum-based fuels. Fast-growing lipid-producing microalgae, such as Scenedesmus obliquus, are considered ideal feedstocks for biofuel production. In this study, the separation of lipids from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae was done through ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction (UASE) process using various solvent mixtures. The effects of resonance amplitude, n-hexane and isopropanol (HIP) ratio, and reaction time on lipid yield were evaluated. Lipid yield optimization was done through central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). Lipid yield of 26.63% was obtained at 50 μm resonance amplitude and 4 v/v HIP ratio. The extracted lipids, mainly composed of fatty acids and esters, had a high heating value (HHV) of 35.38 MJ kg−1. Overall, the results of the study validate the effectiveness of the UASE process for microalgal lipid extraction.
