Application of central composite design in the optimization of lipid yield from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae by ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction The production of carbon-neutral, renewable, and environment-friendly biofuels is currently being implemented worldwide to mitigate the excessive use of petroleum-based fuels. Fast-growing lipid-producing microalgae, such as Scenedesmus obliquus, are considered ideal feedstocks for biofuel production. In this study, the separation of lipids from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae was done through ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction (UASE) process using various solvent mixtures. The effects of resonance amplitude, n-hexane and isopropanol (HIP) ratio, and reaction time on lipid yield were evaluated. Lipid yield optimization was done through central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). Lipid yield of 26.63% was obtained at 50 μm resonance amplitude and 4 v/v HIP ratio. The extracted lipids, mainly composed of fatty acids and esters, had a high heating value (HHV) of 35.38 MJ kg−1. Overall, the results of the study validate the effectiveness of the UASE process for microalgal lipid extraction.
