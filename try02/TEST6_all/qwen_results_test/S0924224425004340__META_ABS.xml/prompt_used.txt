You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in biomass-based carbon dots for smart food packaging applications Background The increasing demand for smart food packaging has driven interest in functional materials that can provide real-time quality monitoring and product protection. Among them, carbon dots (CDs), especially those derived from biomass, have emerged as promising candidates due to their tunable fluorescence, biocompatibility, and environmental responsiveness. However, current research lacks a systematic and integrated discussion of how CDs can be synthesized, functionalized, and engineered for practical packaging applications. Scope and approach This review highlights recent advances in biomass-derived CDs for smart packaging, with a focus on green and scalable synthesis methods, structure-property relationships, and functional integration. Key aspects, including fluorescence behavior, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and environmental responsiveness, are discussed in terms of how they contribute to mechanical and barrier properties reinforcement, freshness indication, food preservation, and anti-counterfeiting. The review further examines the safety, biodegradability, and regulatory issues of biomass-based CDs. Key findings and conclusions Biomass-derived CDs exhibit multifunctional properties that enhance packaging performance and enable intelligent responses to food quality changes. When incorporated into biopolymer matrices, CDs can improve tensile strength, UV shielding, and water vapor and oxygen barrier properties, while also acting as active agents for freshness monitoring, food preservation, and counterfeit prevention. Challenges remain in optimizing fluorescence stability, improving yield and emission tunability, and ensuring compatibility with packaging matrices. Future work should develop multi-responsive CDs that remain stable in cold-chain and low-light conditions, along with standardized production methods linking biomass composition to performance. These advances will improve reproducibility, lower costs, and enable large-scale use.
