You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A parametric study on hydrogen production by fluidized bed co-gasification of biomass and waste plastics This paper presents a parametric study on hydrogen production potential from biomass and waste plastics via fluidized bed co-gasification technique by using different gasifying agents such as steam, air and CO2. In this regard, a new Aspen Plus model representing this process was developed. For this purpose, first, a comparative feedstock selection between several materials was performed, ultimately identifying the cotton husk (CH) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mixture as the most promising choice. Secondly, the study focused on steam co-gasification of CH with HDPE to assess the impact of various factors, including plastic content in feedstock, temperature, steam to feedstock ratio (S/F), and the introduction of gasifying agents, namely air and CO2, next to steam. The analysis mainly examined the influence of these parameters on the composition of syngas, calorific value, and the hydrogen production. Accordingly, it was determined that an increase in plastic content and S/F ratio resulted in higher hydrogen concentration in the syngas, and the maximum quantity of H2 with 1189.3 Nm3/ton feed was produced at 900 °C. In addition, co-utilization of air or CO2 with steam as a gasifying agent deteriorated the system performance regarding H2 yield. Thus, it is expected that the model developed will contribute to the researchers, investors, engineers and policy maker working on the gasification technology for hydrogen production.
