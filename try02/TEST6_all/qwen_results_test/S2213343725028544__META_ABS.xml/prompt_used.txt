You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in membrane and integrated processes for the removal of nanoplastics from water and wastewater Nanoplastics (NPs) pose a significant challenge for water treatment due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment and their potential threats to ecosystems and human health. This review focuses on the removal of NPs from water using membrane technology and integrated processes, which emphasizes the studies on removal mechanisms, novel materials, and practical applications. It systematically summarizes the recent advancements, core mechanisms of NP removal by membranes (including size sieving, electrostatic interactions, and oxidative degradation), and the performance of both standalone membrane systems and membrane-coupled processes (such as coagulation, advanced oxidation, and biological treatment).Key findings demonstrate that membrane technologies achieve superior NPs removal rates of 98.5 % to near 100 % through synergistic mechanisms of size exclusion, surface interactions, adsorption and oxidative degradation. Integrated processes (e.g., membrane bioreactors, magnetic confinement reactors) exhibit particularly outstanding performance (over 99 %). Novel membrane materials, such as metal-organic framework (MOF) composite membranes and functionalized electro-spun membranes, show selective NPs retention capabilities and good antifouling properties (flux recovery >97 %). These results highlight the immense potential of membrane technologies, especially when integrated with intelligent systems (e.g., electrochemical biosensors, responsive membranes), for achieving the effective removal of NPs. Future research should prioritize the development of eco-friendly membrane materials, smart control systems, and efficient hybrid processes (e.g., PEI-modified cellulose nanofiber membrane, ZIF-8 functionalized S-tapered fiber (STF) sensor, Joule heat-assisted electrochemical degradation) to address the complexity of NPs and operational challenges, thereby advancing scalable, efficient, and environmentally benign NPs management solutions.
