Recent advances in membrane and integrated processes for the removal of nanoplastics from water and wastewater Nanoplastics (NPs) pose a significant challenge for water treatment due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment and their potential threats to ecosystems and human health. This review focuses on the removal of NPs from water using membrane technology and integrated processes, which emphasizes the studies on removal mechanisms, novel materials, and practical applications. It systematically summarizes the recent advancements, core mechanisms of NP removal by membranes (including size sieving, electrostatic interactions, and oxidative degradation), and the performance of both standalone membrane systems and membrane-coupled processes (such as coagulation, advanced oxidation, and biological treatment).Key findings demonstrate that membrane technologies achieve superior NPs removal rates of 98.5 % to near 100 % through synergistic mechanisms of size exclusion, surface interactions, adsorption and oxidative degradation. Integrated processes (e.g., membrane bioreactors, magnetic confinement reactors) exhibit particularly outstanding performance (over 99 %). Novel membrane materials, such as metal-organic framework (MOF) composite membranes and functionalized electro-spun membranes, show selective NPs retention capabilities and good antifouling properties (flux recovery >97 %). These results highlight the immense potential of membrane technologies, especially when integrated with intelligent systems (e.g., electrochemical biosensors, responsive membranes), for achieving the effective removal of NPs. Future research should prioritize the development of eco-friendly membrane materials, smart control systems, and efficient hybrid processes (e.g., PEI-modified cellulose nanofiber membrane, ZIF-8 functionalized S-tapered fiber (STF) sensor, Joule heat-assisted electrochemical degradation) to address the complexity of NPs and operational challenges, thereby advancing scalable, efficient, and environmentally benign NPs management solutions.
