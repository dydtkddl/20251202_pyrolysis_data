Solvent-free synthesis of FeCo alloy nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes for oxygen reduction in zinc-air batteries The development of cost-effective, durable, and high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for advancing renewable energy technologies. Here, we report a facile solvent-free synthesis approach, which employs dicyandiamide (DCDA) as both the carbon and nitrogen source, resulting in highly active FeCo alloy nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCo-CNTs) as ORR electrocatalysts. Following acid treatment, the FeCo-CNT-W catalyst exhibited a significantly enhanced surface area of 207.06 m2 g−1 (compared to 23.25 m2 g−1 pre-treatment). During treatment, unfavorable species were removed, creating an optimized catalytic structure. The catalyst demonstrated great ORR performance through a four-electron transfer pathway with minimal hydrogen peroxide formation, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalysts in both activity and durability. When implemented as a cathode material in a zinc-air battery (ZAB), the FeCo-CNT-W maintained stable performance for 495 h under charge-discharge cycling at 5 mA cm−2 (compared to 85 h for Pt/C + RuO2) while achieving a superior power density of 70.2 mW cm−2 at 79.5 mA cm−2. This work presents a sustainable and scalable approach for developing high-performance non-precious metal electrocatalysts for next-generation energy conversion systems.
