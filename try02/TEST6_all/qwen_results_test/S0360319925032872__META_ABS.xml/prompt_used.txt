You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvent-free synthesis of FeCo alloy nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes for oxygen reduction in zinc-air batteries The development of cost-effective, durable, and high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for advancing renewable energy technologies. Here, we report a facile solvent-free synthesis approach, which employs dicyandiamide (DCDA) as both the carbon and nitrogen source, resulting in highly active FeCo alloy nanoparticle-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCo-CNTs) as ORR electrocatalysts. Following acid treatment, the FeCo-CNT-W catalyst exhibited a significantly enhanced surface area of 207.06 m2 g−1 (compared to 23.25 m2 g−1 pre-treatment). During treatment, unfavorable species were removed, creating an optimized catalytic structure. The catalyst demonstrated great ORR performance through a four-electron transfer pathway with minimal hydrogen peroxide formation, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalysts in both activity and durability. When implemented as a cathode material in a zinc-air battery (ZAB), the FeCo-CNT-W maintained stable performance for 495 h under charge-discharge cycling at 5 mA cm−2 (compared to 85 h for Pt/C + RuO2) while achieving a superior power density of 70.2 mW cm−2 at 79.5 mA cm−2. This work presents a sustainable and scalable approach for developing high-performance non-precious metal electrocatalysts for next-generation energy conversion systems.
