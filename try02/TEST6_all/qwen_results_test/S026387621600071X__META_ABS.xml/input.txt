Mathematical modeling of ethane pyrolysis in a flow reactor with allowance for laser radiation effects A mathematical model is proposed to describe the three-dimensional gas flow dynamics in a reactor for pyrolysis of ethane to ethylene with allowance for thermal effects of the absorbed laser radiation. The model is intended to explore the possibility of controlling the conversion of reagents using continuous CO2 laser radiation. The absorption of radiation by ethylene is accompanied by the transformation of radiation energy into thermal energy. The pyrolysis under laser radiation with a power density up to 2×103 W/cm2 was modeled. The numerical model was developed using the ANSYS Fluent package supplemented with a stiff set of ordinary differential equations describing a kinetic scheme of radical chain reactions, and with user modules for refining physicochemical processes. The developed model can be used in multiparameter calculation for designing scalable chemical engineering plants and searching for optimal geometry and physical parameters in laminar gas flow regime.
