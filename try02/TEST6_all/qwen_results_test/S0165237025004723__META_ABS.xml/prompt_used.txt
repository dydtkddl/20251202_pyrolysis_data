You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-production of light olefins and aromatics with high PX selectivity from catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene over shaped ZSM-5 microspheres White pollution has intensified due to plastics’ inherent degradation resistance. Catalytic pyrolysis can convert waste plastics into valuable chemicals like light olefins and aromatics while reducing pollution. However, insufficient selectivity for target products remains a challenge. In this study, the shaped ZSM-5 (Z5) microspheres from industry was used and modified via 3.0 wt% impregnation of P, Ga, and Zn to enhance the yield of light olefins and aromatics in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Incorporating P, Ga, or Zn modulated catalyst acidity, promoting the dehydrogenation /aromatization reactions and significantly increasing liquid, light olefin and aromatic yields. The Zn-Z5 microspheres gave the highest light olefin yield (36.7 wt%), and decreased alkane yield by 24.6 wt%, sharply increasing olefin-alkane ratio from 0.52 to 1.56, compared with Z5. Concurrently, the yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and C9 + aromatics in the liquid products were increased, with the yield of aromatics rising from 22.6 wt% (Z5) to 38.4 wt% (Zn-P/Z5). Notably, the p-xylene (PX) selectivity in xylenes significantly improved, with the selectivity of Zn-P/Z5 attaining 75.3 %. These results show that employing P-, Ga-, and Zn-modified Z5 microspheres for the catalytic pyrolysis of plastics facilitates the high-value recycling of waste plastics, achieving co-production of light olefins and aromatics with high PX selectivity.
