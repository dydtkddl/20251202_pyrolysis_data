Decoupling the catalytic features of an Fe2O3/USY catalyst in polyethylene pyrolysis using machine learning The catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste using bifunctional metal/zeolite catalysts offers a sustainable route for sustainable resource recovery, aligning with the goals of a circular economy. However, the complex interplay between acidity, pore structure, and metal dispersion creates a multidimensional cross-coupling effects that impede catalyst optimization. To address this challenge, this study employs machine learning to decouple the catalytic features of an Fe₂O₃/USY catalyst in polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis. Based on a comprehensive experimental dataset, we develop predictive models using the XGB algorithm, achieving high predictive accuracy across all targets, with R² values of 0.914–0.983 for the training set and 0.845–0.942 for the testing set, encompassing product yields (oil, gas, coke) and oil composition (carbon number and chemical constitution). SHAP and partial dependence analyses revealed that catalyst acidity dominates product distribution, where excessive Brønsted acidity (A B > 20 mmol/g) reduces oil yield (52.5–78.8 %), while high Lewis acidity (A L > 170 mmol/g) enhances alkane selectivity. Optimal conditions for gasoline (C₅-C₁₂) and jet fuel (C8-C16) production include high total acidity (A N > 620 mmol/g) and low Fe loading (< 3 %), whereas lubricant (C₂₀₊) formation favors balanced acidity and higher Fe content (5–7 %). This work bridges data-driven discovery with practical applications in plastic waste valorization, offering actionable insights for designing sustainable bifunctional catalysts and contributing to the development of green and sustainable environmental technologies.
