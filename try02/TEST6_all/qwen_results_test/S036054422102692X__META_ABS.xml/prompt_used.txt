You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of temperature and urea concentration on nitrogen-rich pyrolysis: Pyrolysis behavior and product distribution in bio-oil Nitrogen-rich pyrolysis is an important means of biomass utilization. In this paper, the effects of urea concentration and pyrolysis temperature on the composition of various nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds in bio-oil produced during the pyrolysis of pine powder (PP) were studied. The results showed that A-type (a benzene ring with one methoxy group) and B-type (a benzene ring with two methoxy groups) phenols were only detected in the bio-oil derived from conventional biomass pyrolysis. After nitrogen-rich pyrolysis, the total phenolic content in the bio-oil increased significantly, and all four types of phenols (A, B, C (a benzene ring featuring an alkyl group that is not a methoxy group), and D (other types of phenols)) were detected. In addition, the aldehyde and linear chain ketone contents in the bio-oil significantly decreased after nitrogen-rich pyrolysis compared to after conventional biomass pyrolysis. When the urea concentration was 10 wt%, only cyclic ketones were detected in the bio-oil. Furthermore, the content of nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds in the bio-oil significantly increased after nitrogen-rich pyrolysis when the urea concentration increased from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, with pyridine being the most abundantly produced.
