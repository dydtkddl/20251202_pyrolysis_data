Effects of temperature and urea concentration on nitrogen-rich pyrolysis: Pyrolysis behavior and product distribution in bio-oil Nitrogen-rich pyrolysis is an important means of biomass utilization. In this paper, the effects of urea concentration and pyrolysis temperature on the composition of various nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds in bio-oil produced during the pyrolysis of pine powder (PP) were studied. The results showed that A-type (a benzene ring with one methoxy group) and B-type (a benzene ring with two methoxy groups) phenols were only detected in the bio-oil derived from conventional biomass pyrolysis. After nitrogen-rich pyrolysis, the total phenolic content in the bio-oil increased significantly, and all four types of phenols (A, B, C (a benzene ring featuring an alkyl group that is not a methoxy group), and D (other types of phenols)) were detected. In addition, the aldehyde and linear chain ketone contents in the bio-oil significantly decreased after nitrogen-rich pyrolysis compared to after conventional biomass pyrolysis. When the urea concentration was 10 wt%, only cyclic ketones were detected in the bio-oil. Furthermore, the content of nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds in the bio-oil significantly increased after nitrogen-rich pyrolysis when the urea concentration increased from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, with pyridine being the most abundantly produced.
