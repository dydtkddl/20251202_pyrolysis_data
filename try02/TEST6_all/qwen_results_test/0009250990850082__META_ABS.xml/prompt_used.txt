You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of a binary mixture of complex hydrocarbons: Reaction modeling A reaction model was developed for the pyrolysis of binary mixtures of compounds whose reactions can be apportioned into three or fewer parallel chains coupled by chain transfer. A representative application of this model to the pyrolysis of mixtures of the asphaltene model compounds n-pentadecylbenzene (PDB) and n-tridecylcyclohexane (TDC) illustrates its utility. The model, along with its associated rate constant estimates, quantitatively correlated the experimental temporal variations of the product yields from the individual pyrolyses of PDB and TDC. Model results for binary mixtures of PDB and TDC showed that the pyrolysis rates for both compounds were accelerated by the addition of the second compound. For instance, the pyrolysis of PDB at an initial concentration of 10−4M proceeded at a 36% higher rate in the presence of TDC at an equal concentration. The rate of TDC pyrolysis at [TDC] = 10−4M, on the other hand, increased more than nine-fold upon the addition of PDB at a concentration of 10−4M. Unlike the accelerated reaction rates, product selectivities were largely insensitive to the presence of the second compound. These results are consistent with and can be explained on the basis of the influence of concentration on the relative kinetics of bimolecular and unimolecular propagation, chain transfer, and termination steps. The model results also lead to the identification of quantitative criteria for determining when an added compound can act as a rate accelerator. Finally, this study permits speculation into the effects of interactions between alkylaromatic and alkylnaphthenic moieties in asphaltenes on the pyrolysis pathways, products, and kinetics.
