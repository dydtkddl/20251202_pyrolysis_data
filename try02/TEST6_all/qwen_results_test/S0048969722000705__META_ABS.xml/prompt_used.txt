You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-GC–MS analysis of ingested polystyrene microsphere content in individual Daphnia magna Microplastic (MP) pollution in the aquatic environment is a cause for increasing concern. However, analyzing MPs ingested by small organisms, such as zooplankton, is difficult because of the low content and small size of the ingested MPs. We attempted to determine the content of ingested MPs in individual zooplankton using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS). To establish zooplankton model of MP ingestion, individual Daphnia magna were cultivated separately in microplate cells with polystyrene (PS) microspheres (10 μm in diameter, 245,000 particles, 135 μg) under different conditions. To prepare calibration curves for determining ingested PS content, approximately 100–150 μg of commercially available Daphnia-based powdered fish food, roughly corresponding to the weight of a single D. magna organism, was mixed with PS microspheres (0.005–26 μg) and analyzed using Py-GC–MS at 600 °C. In the resulting pyrograms, peaks of the styrene monomer and trimer from PS were detected, and linear relationships were obtained between the relative peak area and the amount of added PS. Finally, the cultivated zooplankton were individually subjected to Py-GC–MS analysis, and the ingested PS content in each zooplankton was successfully determined. Individual zooplankton cultured with PS in the absence of food ingested 2.3–7.9 μg of PS particles, whereas that in the presence of food (Chlorella vulgaris) ingested only 0.1–0.2 μg of PS particles. This result suggests that zooplankton might preferentially ingest ordinary food when both food and MPs are present, although further systematic studies are necessary to validate this observation.
