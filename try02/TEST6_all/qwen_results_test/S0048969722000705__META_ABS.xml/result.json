  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study uses pyrolysis-GC–MS for microplastic detection in organisms, but the pyrolysis is not of plastic feedstock for conversion; instead, it is a analytical method applied to trace microplastics in biological samples, lacking experimental pyrolysis of plastic waste."
