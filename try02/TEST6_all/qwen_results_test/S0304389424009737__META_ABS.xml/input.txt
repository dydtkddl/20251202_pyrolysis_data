Revitalizing plastic wastes employing bio-circular-green economy principles for carbon neutrality The use of plastics has become deeply ingrained in our society, and there are no indications that its prevalence will decrease in the foreseeable future. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the global plastic waste disposal landscape, examining it through regional perspectives, various management technologies (dumping or landfilling, incineration, and reuse and recycling), and across different sectors including agriculture and food, textile, tourism, and healthcare. Notably, this study compiles the findings on life-cycle carbon footprints associated with various plastic waste management practices as documented in the literature. Employing the bio-circular-green economy model, we advocate for the adoption of streamlined and sustainable approaches to plastic management. Unique management measures are also discussed including the utilization of bioplastics combined with smart and efficient collection processes that facilitate recycling, industrial composting, or anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the integration of advanced recycling methods for conventional plastics with renewable energy, the establishment of plastic tax and credits, and the establishment of extended producer responsibility are reviewed. The success of these initiatives relies on collaboration and support from peers, industries, and consumers, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and fostering sustainable practices in plastic waste management.
