CO2 intensified supercritical water gasification of waste plastics To enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the supercritical water gasification of plastic wastes, this study proposed a new approach by introducing CO2 to modify the reaction environment. The gasification performance of waste plastic was comparatively investigated in a mixed fluid consisting of supercritical water and CO2. The results highlighted that gasification efficiency was significantly higher in the mixed fluids than supercritical water alone, with more H2 and CH4 produced through chain reactions initiated by the Boudouard reaction. Increase in key factors, such as reaction temperature, time, and amount of CO2 added, positively influenced plastic gasification. At 700 °C, the carbon conversion rate achieved in mixed fluids was approximately 2.5 times higher than in supercritical water alone. Moreover, the improvement in gasification performance varied among different plastics. Polystyrene exhibited the greatest improvement, followed by polycarbonate, and then polyethylene. These differences stem from the thermal stability of the plastic monomer structures and their interactions with fluid molecules. Simulation results further revealed that the mixed supercritical fluids possess superior solvation ability compared to supercritical water, promoting a more homogeneous reaction.
