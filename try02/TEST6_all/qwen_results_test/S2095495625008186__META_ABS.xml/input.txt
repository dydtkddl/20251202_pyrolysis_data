Structural regulation and interface engineering in silicon-based anodes for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries: A comprehensive review Silicon (Si)-based anodes have emerged as promising candidates for the next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g−1). However, their further application is hindered by critical challenges, including severe volume expansion (∼300 %), formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and inherently low conductivity. While extensive research has sought to alleviate the substantial internal stress caused by volume expansion through the rational design of Si-based anode structures, the underlying mechanisms that govern these improvements remain insufficiently understood, leaving significant gaps in mechanical and interface electrical failure. To build a comprehensive understanding relationship between structural design and performance enhancement of Si-based anodes, this review first analyzes the characteristics of various Si-based anode structures and their associated internal stresses. Subsequently, it summarizes effective strategies to optimize the performance of Si-based anodes, including doping design, novel electrolyte design, and functional binder design. Additionally, we assess emerging technologies with high commercial potential for structural design and interfacial modification, such as porous carbon carriers, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), spray granulation, and pre-lithiation. Finally, this work provides perspectives on the structural design of Si-based anodes. Overall, this review systematically summarizes modification strategies for Si-based anodes through structural regulation and interface engineering, thereby providing a foundation for advanced structural and interfacial design.
