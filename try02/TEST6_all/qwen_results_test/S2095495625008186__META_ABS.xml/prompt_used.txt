You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structural regulation and interface engineering in silicon-based anodes for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries: A comprehensive review Silicon (Si)-based anodes have emerged as promising candidates for the next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g−1). However, their further application is hindered by critical challenges, including severe volume expansion (∼300 %), formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and inherently low conductivity. While extensive research has sought to alleviate the substantial internal stress caused by volume expansion through the rational design of Si-based anode structures, the underlying mechanisms that govern these improvements remain insufficiently understood, leaving significant gaps in mechanical and interface electrical failure. To build a comprehensive understanding relationship between structural design and performance enhancement of Si-based anodes, this review first analyzes the characteristics of various Si-based anode structures and their associated internal stresses. Subsequently, it summarizes effective strategies to optimize the performance of Si-based anodes, including doping design, novel electrolyte design, and functional binder design. Additionally, we assess emerging technologies with high commercial potential for structural design and interfacial modification, such as porous carbon carriers, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), spray granulation, and pre-lithiation. Finally, this work provides perspectives on the structural design of Si-based anodes. Overall, this review systematically summarizes modification strategies for Si-based anodes through structural regulation and interface engineering, thereby providing a foundation for advanced structural and interfacial design.
