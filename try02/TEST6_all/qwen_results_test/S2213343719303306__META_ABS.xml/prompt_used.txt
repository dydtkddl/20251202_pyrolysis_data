You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of Solid residue and Flue Gas from Thermal Plasma Treatment of Petroleum Sludge The traditional methods of disposing of petroleum sludge are short of providing the much-needed benign treatment. A more robust treatment technique is desirable. In this investigation, a laboratory-scale thermal plasma reactor was developed and was used to treat 20 g per batch of petroleum oily sludge. The output current and the plasma temperature measured using an infrared thermometer range were 5 – 200 A and 356 – 1694 °C respectively. After the plasma treatment, the morphology of the sludge transformed from jelly-like to crystalline solid structure. A mass and volume reductions of 36.87 – 91.40% and 59.59 – 94.52%, respectively, were achieved in a treatment period of 2 – 5 min. A Total Organic Compound (TOC) reduction of 21.47 – 93.76% were equally achieved in same treatment period. Heavy metals concentration in the sludge were increased after the plasma treatment, whereas, Ni and Pb manifested only in the solid residue. The result of the leaching test of heavy metals from the solid residue is within the US EPA recommended level for secure landfill. The major components of the flue gas were H2, CO, CO2 and H2O with small quantities of CH4, C2H2 and C2H4. The flue gas has an LHV range of 7.40 – 7.86 MJ/Nm3 with a corresponding cold gas efficiency of 25.22 – 51.90%. Based on the operating cost estimation, a profit margin of $ 0.76 /kg of sludge was established. The thermal plasma technique is, therefore, an alternative treatment method for treating petroleum sludge.
