You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemical immunosensor for individual and simultaneous determination of Cytokeratin fragment antigen 21-1 and Neuron-specific enolase using carbon dots-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotube electrode In this approach, we fabricated a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for individual and simultaneous sensing of cytokeratin fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA 21-1) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) using the multiple-label concept. In this report, carbon dots (CDs) were prepared from citric acid and ethylenediamine (EDA). A hybrid EDA-CDs-MWCNTs composites were prepared and then decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The obtained hybrid composites were used as an immunosensing platform. Furthermore, AuNPs decorated EDA-CDs-MWCNTs was carefully loaded with reactive dye (orange G and carminic acid) and utilized as signal labels. The surface morphology and the electrochemical properties of the modified SPCE were studied carefully. The linear range for the individual and simultaneous detection was 0.002–10 ng mL−1 for the CYFRA 21-1 and NSE and the detection limits (LODs) were 0.22 pg mL−1 and 0.15 pg mL−1 for the individual detection while 0.25 pg mL−1 and 0.20 pg mL−1 for simultaneous detection, respectively. This developed immunoassay was utilized for the assessment of two markers in the serum sample with reasonable consequences.
