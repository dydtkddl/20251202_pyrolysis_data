You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Stepwise dechlorination and co-pyrolysis of poplar wood with dechlorinated polyvinyl chloride: Synergistic effect and products distribution With the combination of stepwise dechlorination and co-pyrolysis techniques, this study conducted polyvinyl chloride (PVC) dechlorination experiments and co-pyrolysis experiments of poplar wood (PW) with dechlorinated polyvinyl chloride (DPVC) by thermogravimetric analysis and a fixed bed reactor. Stepwise pyrolysis effectively removed Cl from PVC with a dechlorination efficiency of 99.84 % at 360 °C for 30 min. Thermogravimetric tests and thermokinetic variables were employed to describe the co-pyrolysis process's thermodynamic behavior, where co-pyrolysis significantly diminished the activation energy of the initial pyrolysis stage (9.65–21.62 kJ/mol) and increased the reaction rate (0.02–0.09 %/°C). The synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis enhanced the yield and quality of liquid oil and reduced the solid residue rate, with the maximum change in solid residue rate (−2.36 wt%) occurring at PW:DPVC = 3:7. The optimal conditions for the synergistic effect are a raw material ratio of 3:7 at 500 °C. Co-pyrolysis efficiently reduced the content of oxygen-containing compounds of phenols, ketones, and acids in oil, and elevated the selectivity of aromatics. The research methods avoid the drawbacks of bio-oil and plastic oil and improve the quality of pyrolysis oil in a concise and efficient manner, which provides some new ideas for the resource and clean utilization of municipal waste.
