Accelerated photodegradation of PMMA films: Synergistic effect of mixed solvents As a widely used and versatile polymer, poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is difficult to degrade in the natural environment due to the inertness of the C-C bonds in the polymer chain. Pyrolysis with a high temperature of about 450 °C is a major but not eco-friendly method of waste PMMA degradation today. Herein, we report a photodegradation process of PMMA accelerated by small amounts of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chloroform (TCM) at near room temperature. Compared with the blank samples, the mixed solvents accelerated the production of the methyl methacrylate (MMA) by about 130 times. A synergistic effect between the components of the mixed solvent was proved by experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The reaction of TCM with THF promotes the chlorination of the ester group of PMMA, and finally causes the accelerated photo-depolymerization of PMMA in a condition with relative mild temperature required. This new mechanism has the potential to become a new strategy for upcycling PMMA waste plastics.
