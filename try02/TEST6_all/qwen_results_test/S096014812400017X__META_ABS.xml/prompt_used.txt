You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical study on a novel solar-thermal-reaction system for clean hydrogen production of methanol-steam reforming Renewable energy-driven hydrogen production methods offer a promising solution for mitigating energy crises. The present study introduces a new solar-driven hydrogen production system that within methanol steam reforming (MSR) process. The numerical analysis is carried out using a cylindrical Fresnel linear concentrator coupled with a solar thermal reactor (STR). A comprehensive kinetic model of the MSR reaction was constructed and combined with analytical methods based on Monte Carlo ray tracing methods and finite volume methods to analyze the multi-physical properties involved in the reaction process. The results indicate that a novel solar-driven MSR-STR system can generate a sufficient driving force after adjusting the concentrator structure and relative position to match the energy demand of the MSR reaction. The accuracy of the model is compared with the experimental values, and the average error is 7.8 %. Tracking error of the component should be maintained below 1.5° to ensure the optical efficiency. The annual hydrogen production was analyzed and the levelized cost of hydrogen is $1.77/kg. Finally, a comparison is presented between the proposed MSR-STR system and parabolic trough concentrator based MSR hydrogen production system to evaluate the feasibility of the former in terms of the economics of implementation.
