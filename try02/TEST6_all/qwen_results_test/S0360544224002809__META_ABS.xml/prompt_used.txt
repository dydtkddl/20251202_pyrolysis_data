You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on CO2 co-gasification characteristics of biomass and waste plastics: Insight into interaction and targeted regulation method The CO2 gasification of biomass and waste plastics is one of the essential ways to utilize solid waste resources, and it is also potential negative carbon emission technology. The complex interactions in the co-gasification of biomass and waste plastics affect the quality of syngas and the efficient conversion of solid waste. In this study, sawdust, PE and PVC were selected for CO2 gasification. Firstly, the interaction and gasification characteristics were investigated by thermogravimetric experiments. Then, the impact of interaction on syngas generation and quality was studied through fluidized bed experiments. The results indicated that PE, PVC, and sawdust co-gasification exhibits both inhibitory and synergistic. PE inhibits the release of volatiles in sawdust, while PVC promotes the volatiles release. In short, PVC improves the gasification reactivity of sawdust, and PE enhances syngas quality. Adding 75 % PE, the syngas Low Heating Value by 415 % up to 30.05 MJ/kg, and Cold Gas Efficiency by 147 %. The synergistic of the sawdust/PE-PVC was manifested as the superposition and amplification of the synergistic in sawdust/PE and sawdust/PVC. Adjusting the PE and PVC proportion, syngas quality can be targeted to control. The study results exhibit new perspectives on classifying waste plastics for gasification and regulating syngas quality.
