You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel adsorption-based upgradation of end-of-life polypropylene pyrolysis oil using carbonised rice husk Plastic waste management is a global issue, with end-of-life polypropylene (EoL PP) having significant contribution. Polypropylene degradation forms undesirable compounds in pyrolysis oil, reducing its quality and limiting its fuel usability. Pyrolysis offers a promising solution for converting plastic waste into valuable fuels; however, the presence of degraded materials necessitates an effective upgrading process to enhance the fuel quality. This study introduces an innovative ex-situ adsorption-based upgradation technique using carbonised rice husk (CRH), an abundantly available, sustainable and cost-effective biomass residue, to significantly improve the quality of pyrolysis oil derived from EoL PP. The upgradation process reduced sulphur content in polypropylene pyrolysis oil from 0.19 % to 0.02 %. The cetane index, a key fuel quality metric, rose from 43.83 to 55.25, enhancing combustion properties. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance showed an increase in paraffin content from 53.15 vol% to 60.81 vol%, improving energy content and combustion efficiency. Olefins and aromatics decreased, improving fuel stability and reducing emissions. GCxGC TOF-MS analysis revealed a decrease in oxygenates and an increase in diesel-range hydrocarbons, improving fuel quality and stability. This comprehensive study highlights the dual benefits of CRH in enhancing fuel quality and supporting circular economy practices, making a significant contribution to the development of sustainable fuel alternatives in the waste-to-energy conversion sector.
