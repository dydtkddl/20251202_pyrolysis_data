You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal monovacancy-induced spin polarization for simultaneous energy recovery and wastewater purification Simultaneous hydrogen generation and pollutants removal is considered as the potential solution to the energy and environmental crisis, which can cut the consumption of expensive sacrificial electron donors and reduce the ecotoxicity of wastewater containing pollutants. However, the integration of two redox half-reactions in one system is still a challenge, limited by irreconcilable reaction conditions and low kinetics. In this study, ZnO with abundant metal monovacancies (Zn-V-m) was fabricated to manipulate the spin state by tailoring the electron occupancy of e g-orbitals, which simultaneously endowed the material with both outstanding photocatalytic oxidation and reduction performance. Compared with pristine ZnO, the prepared Zn-V-20 increases the H2 production rate by 56.4-fold and enhances the pollutants removal efficiency by 27.5-fold. It is impressive that simultaneous hydrogen generation and pollutants degradation in one system is accomplished and accelerated. Furthermore, Zn L-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that low electron occupancy of e g-orbitals optimizes the spin structure and leads to spin polarization, which provides the critical motivation for enhancing photocatalytic performance. This work accelerates the reaction rates of pollutants degradation and hydrogen generation at the surface interface by manipulating electron spin polarization, guiding the rational design of TMO-based catalysts for simultaneous energy recovery and wastewater purification.
