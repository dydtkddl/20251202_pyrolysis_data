You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of plastics and paper mill sludge into carbon composite and its catalytic performance for acarbon material consisted of the multi-layerzo dye oxidation In this work, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and paper mill sludge (PMS) were co-pyrolyzed under two environments of N2 and CO2. The pyrolysis process was assessed by conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and monitoring the evolution of gaseous products. The resulting solid composites were characterized using XRD, XPS, BET, and Raman analyzers, and their ability to catalytically activate persulfate (S2O8 2−) was tested by conducting methyl orange (MO) degradation experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC and PMS at the same mass ratio (1:1) in CO2 resulted in the highest production of H2 and CO (0.36 mol % H2 at 480 °C & 1.53 mol % CO at 700 °C). The characterization results revealed that the composite consisted of Fe3O4, highly graphitic carbon, and mesoporous structure. In MO oxidation experiments, the co-pyrolyzed composite actively generated OH and SO4 − by activating S2O8 2− to achieve complete removal of 5 mg L-1 of MO during 100 min at acidic-neutral pH condition. The composite was also able to complete 3 successive cycles of MO oxidation without deactivation. Consequently, the feasibility of achieving the simultaneous production of energy resources and catalyst via industrial wastes utilization in pyrolytic process was demonstrated.
