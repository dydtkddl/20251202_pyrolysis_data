Navigating process optimization in organosolv fractionation: a model-driven approach applied to poplar biomass The present work examines the impact of extraction time (1–3 h), temperature (180–210 °C), and ethanol concentration (40–80 vol%) on the auto-catalyzed Organosolv fractionation of poplar biomass. To facilitate data interpretation and enable process optimization, an Adaboosted quadratic model was regressed against the experimental data. It revealed that delignification is primarily driven by the ethanol-to-water ratio, followed by temperature. When evaluating the pulp quality, maximum delignification (≈ 90 %) is observed at 55–60 vol% ethanol and 210 °C, with cellulose degradation remaining limited when varying the operating conditions. The glucose content in both the pulp and residual liquor is largely constant, regardless of the operating conditions, while the xylose content declines rapidly at higher temperatures. Moreover, the xylose content in the pulp already drops significantly at 180 °C for extraction times exceeding 1.5 h and ≤ 45 vol% ethanol, whereas higher ethanol concentrations more effectively preserve the hemicellulose fraction, even at more severe operating conditions. Lignin properties are strongly impacted by the ethanol concentration and temperature, with time playing a lesser role. At 180 °C, solvolysis is limited, resulting in lignins with high molecular weights, exceeding 7,000 g/mol. Furthermore, higher ethanol concentrations (> 70 vol%) preserve the native-like structures, even at increasing temperatures and times. The latter is attributed to limited hydrolysis reactions in case of lower water concentrations, in addition to ethanol acting as a capping agent and formaldehyde scavenger. This work offers a model-driven framework for optimizing Organosolv process conditions and provides mechanistic insights to guide future biorefinery applications.
