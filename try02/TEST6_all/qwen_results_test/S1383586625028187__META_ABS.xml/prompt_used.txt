You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Navigating process optimization in organosolv fractionation: a model-driven approach applied to poplar biomass The present work examines the impact of extraction time (1–3 h), temperature (180–210 °C), and ethanol concentration (40–80 vol%) on the auto-catalyzed Organosolv fractionation of poplar biomass. To facilitate data interpretation and enable process optimization, an Adaboosted quadratic model was regressed against the experimental data. It revealed that delignification is primarily driven by the ethanol-to-water ratio, followed by temperature. When evaluating the pulp quality, maximum delignification (≈ 90 %) is observed at 55–60 vol% ethanol and 210 °C, with cellulose degradation remaining limited when varying the operating conditions. The glucose content in both the pulp and residual liquor is largely constant, regardless of the operating conditions, while the xylose content declines rapidly at higher temperatures. Moreover, the xylose content in the pulp already drops significantly at 180 °C for extraction times exceeding 1.5 h and ≤ 45 vol% ethanol, whereas higher ethanol concentrations more effectively preserve the hemicellulose fraction, even at more severe operating conditions. Lignin properties are strongly impacted by the ethanol concentration and temperature, with time playing a lesser role. At 180 °C, solvolysis is limited, resulting in lignins with high molecular weights, exceeding 7,000 g/mol. Furthermore, higher ethanol concentrations (> 70 vol%) preserve the native-like structures, even at increasing temperatures and times. The latter is attributed to limited hydrolysis reactions in case of lower water concentrations, in addition to ethanol acting as a capping agent and formaldehyde scavenger. This work offers a model-driven framework for optimizing Organosolv process conditions and provides mechanistic insights to guide future biorefinery applications.
