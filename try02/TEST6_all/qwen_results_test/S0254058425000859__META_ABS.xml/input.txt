Improving performance of composites: Natural and synthetic fibre hybridisation techniques in composite materials – A review This review paper explored the mechanical and thermal characteristics of hybrid composites by emphasising their performance using different types of fibres. This work also examines various kinds of biofibres and synthetic fibres reinforced with other polymers, focussing on how these composites behave in moisture conditions. Although hybrid fibres offer a variety of benefits, the hybridisation of natural and synthetic fibres poses challenges: increased moisture absorption, poor fibre-to-matrix adhesion bonding, and limited heat resistance. Fibre surface modification treatments can overcome these challenges. Thus, the hybridisation of natural-natural, natural-synthetic and synthetic-synthetic fibres, offers a wide range of applications in the automotive industry, 3D printing, military equipment, construction, and building industries, among others. This study highlights the current efforts using hybrid materials in different characterisation techniques, predominantly mechanical, thermal, and moisture absorption behaviours, which have helped address the current challenges and improved their performance in various fields.
