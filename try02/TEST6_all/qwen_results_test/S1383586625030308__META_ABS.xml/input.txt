Zerovalent iron-loaded sawdust biochar for paracetamol removal from aqueous solution through persulfate activation The current study employed red mud (RM) alongside saw dust (SD) at three different ratios for one step microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis for the synthesis of zerovalent iron-loaded sawdust biochar (Fe0-SDB) for the removal of paracetamol from aqueous solutions. Fe0-SDB was employed to initiate persulfate activation, demonstrating an effective catalytic process for paracetamol (PCT) degradation. Optimal performance was demonstrated by the S1R2 biochar synthesized at 800 W microwave power for 20 min with an RM: SD mass ratio of 2:1. The average pore size of S1R2 was observed to be 2.98 ± 1.5 µm and Fe content of 11.6 wt% was determined through SEM-EDS analysis. The appearance of XRD peak at 2θ of 44.8° and 35.8° indicated the presence of both Fe0 (α-Fe) and FeO crystalline phases, supported by XPS high-resolution deconvoluted peaks of Fe 2p. Two FTIR peaks at 1592 cm−1 and 598 cm−1 were observed attributing to C=C of the aromatic ring and Fe–O, evincing the core–shell structure of Fe0 particles. Central composite design (CCD) was employed to investigate the interactive effect of S1R2 dosage and initial PCT concentration on the removal efficiency. PCT degradation increased from 72 % to 92.5 %, as the S1R2 dosage varied from 0.5 to 2.0 g/L. Within 90 min, 93.2 % of PCT (5.6 mg/L) was eliminated using 2 g/L of persulfate and 1.8 g/L of S1R2 under ambient temperature (27 ± 3 °C). The developed quadratic model predicted paracetamol degradation efficiency with minor error of 1.64 %. SO4 •- and •OH were majorly responsible for PCT breakdown through different reactions like hydroxylation, deacetylation, followed by aromatic ring cleavage. S1R2 displayed remarkable reusability with ∼88 % PCT degradation after 3 reutilization cycles. Overall, this study highlights the potential of the Fe0-SDB-persulfate system as an effective and sustainable method for paracetamol removal in wastewater treatment, satisfying the goals of SDG-6 and SDG-12.
