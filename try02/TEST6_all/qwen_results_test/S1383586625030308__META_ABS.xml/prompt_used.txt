You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zerovalent iron-loaded sawdust biochar for paracetamol removal from aqueous solution through persulfate activation The current study employed red mud (RM) alongside saw dust (SD) at three different ratios for one step microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis for the synthesis of zerovalent iron-loaded sawdust biochar (Fe0-SDB) for the removal of paracetamol from aqueous solutions. Fe0-SDB was employed to initiate persulfate activation, demonstrating an effective catalytic process for paracetamol (PCT) degradation. Optimal performance was demonstrated by the S1R2 biochar synthesized at 800 W microwave power for 20 min with an RM: SD mass ratio of 2:1. The average pore size of S1R2 was observed to be 2.98 ± 1.5 µm and Fe content of 11.6 wt% was determined through SEM-EDS analysis. The appearance of XRD peak at 2θ of 44.8° and 35.8° indicated the presence of both Fe0 (α-Fe) and FeO crystalline phases, supported by XPS high-resolution deconvoluted peaks of Fe 2p. Two FTIR peaks at 1592 cm−1 and 598 cm−1 were observed attributing to C=C of the aromatic ring and Fe–O, evincing the core–shell structure of Fe0 particles. Central composite design (CCD) was employed to investigate the interactive effect of S1R2 dosage and initial PCT concentration on the removal efficiency. PCT degradation increased from 72 % to 92.5 %, as the S1R2 dosage varied from 0.5 to 2.0 g/L. Within 90 min, 93.2 % of PCT (5.6 mg/L) was eliminated using 2 g/L of persulfate and 1.8 g/L of S1R2 under ambient temperature (27 ± 3 °C). The developed quadratic model predicted paracetamol degradation efficiency with minor error of 1.64 %. SO4 •- and •OH were majorly responsible for PCT breakdown through different reactions like hydroxylation, deacetylation, followed by aromatic ring cleavage. S1R2 displayed remarkable reusability with ∼88 % PCT degradation after 3 reutilization cycles. Overall, this study highlights the potential of the Fe0-SDB-persulfate system as an effective and sustainable method for paracetamol removal in wastewater treatment, satisfying the goals of SDG-6 and SDG-12.
