Pyrolysis of waste oils for biofuel production: An economic and life cycle assessment Waste oil treatment and the burning of fossil fuels are causing environmental problems, thus using waste oils as pyrolysis feedstock to produce high-grade biofuels is receiving a lot of attention. Higher hydrogen and volatile matter contents of waste oils make them an optimal raw material for biofuel production. Conversely, attaining satisfactory effects employing traditional disposal methods such as gasification, solvent extraction, transesterification, membrane technology, and hydro-treating is strenuous. Clean and secure pyrolysis technology can help overcome the present dilemma. Biofuels obtained by the traditional waste oil pyrolysis methods can replace fossil fuel as it has been proven to have a high yield and higher heating value (HHV); however, they contain a high acid value. Nevertheless, treating with metal, zeolites, and other bi-functional catalysts helps decrease the acid value. Energy and time can be effectively saved with improved bio-oil yield and quality by co-pyrolysis with plastic waste. A comprehensive assessment of biofuel production via conventional and progressive pyrolysis of waste oils has been investigated. The current evaluation defines the technical and economical routine for bio-oil production from numerous biomass through pyrolysis. Analyzing the bio-oil production cost is one of the crucial components in determining the market affinity of different alternative biofuels. Bio-oil can be made through biomass pyrolysis using an energy integration approach smoothly. The Life cycle assessment (LCA) of waste oil with co-feeds was also discussed in-depth. The conclusions gained using the following study might influence the research on the bio-oil industry targeted at commercializing the product.
