You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of waste oils for biofuel production: An economic and life cycle assessment Waste oil treatment and the burning of fossil fuels are causing environmental problems, thus using waste oils as pyrolysis feedstock to produce high-grade biofuels is receiving a lot of attention. Higher hydrogen and volatile matter contents of waste oils make them an optimal raw material for biofuel production. Conversely, attaining satisfactory effects employing traditional disposal methods such as gasification, solvent extraction, transesterification, membrane technology, and hydro-treating is strenuous. Clean and secure pyrolysis technology can help overcome the present dilemma. Biofuels obtained by the traditional waste oil pyrolysis methods can replace fossil fuel as it has been proven to have a high yield and higher heating value (HHV); however, they contain a high acid value. Nevertheless, treating with metal, zeolites, and other bi-functional catalysts helps decrease the acid value. Energy and time can be effectively saved with improved bio-oil yield and quality by co-pyrolysis with plastic waste. A comprehensive assessment of biofuel production via conventional and progressive pyrolysis of waste oils has been investigated. The current evaluation defines the technical and economical routine for bio-oil production from numerous biomass through pyrolysis. Analyzing the bio-oil production cost is one of the crucial components in determining the market affinity of different alternative biofuels. Bio-oil can be made through biomass pyrolysis using an energy integration approach smoothly. The Life cycle assessment (LCA) of waste oil with co-feeds was also discussed in-depth. The conclusions gained using the following study might influence the research on the bio-oil industry targeted at commercializing the product.
