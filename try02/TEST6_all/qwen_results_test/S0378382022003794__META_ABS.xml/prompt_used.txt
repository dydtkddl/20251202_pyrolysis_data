You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of activated biochar as a low-cost catalyst on the quality of catalytic intermediate co-pyrolysis oil from waste polystyrene and green coconut pericarp Biochar-based catalysts and waste polystyrene were employed to study their effects on both the yield and composition of the oil produced on the intermediate pyrolysis of green coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) pericarp through catalytic co-pyrolysis. Biochar from intermediate pyrolysis was directly employed as a catalyst, but steam-activated biochars with different activation times from single step activation were also studied as low-cost catalysts. The properties of the catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, SEM, SEM-EDS, XRD, and ATR-FTIR techniques. From these techniques, AAEM (especially K) and O-containing functional groups were identified on both biochar and activated biochars, but the activated ones presented a higher surface area (>600 m2 g−1). Results from pyrolysis assays confirmed that co-processing biomass and waste plastic leads to a higher yield of oil while greatly shifting the product composition towards less oxygenated compounds. Catalytic co-pyrolysis with low-cost catalysts confirmed that it is possible to attain a high yield of monoaromatics without relying on zeolite catalysts. This effect was attributed to a synergetic effect between waste polystyrene and activated biochar, which ultimately resulted in an oil organic fraction containing up to 60% of xylene in its composition and presenting a HHV of 34.11 MJ kg−1.
