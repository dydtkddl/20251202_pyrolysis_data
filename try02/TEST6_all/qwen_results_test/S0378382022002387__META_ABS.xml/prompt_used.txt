You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High syngas selectivity and near pure hydrogen production in perovskite oxygen carriers for chemical looping steam methane reforming Chemical looping steam methane reforming (CL-SMR) provides an attractive route for hydrogen and syngas co-production through two successive steps of methane oxidation and steam splitting. However, there is also carbon formation through CH4 cracking which hampers the production of syngas (H2 and CO) and the following production of pure H2. This work prepared the perovskites La0.95Ce0.05NixFe1-xO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0) as oxygen carriers for CL-SMR. The methane activation and steam splitting were investigated based on reactivity tests on a fixed-bed reactor and various characterizations. Results showed that La0.95Ce0.05Ni0.2Fe0.8O3 and La0.95Ce0.05Ni0.5Fe0.5O3 reached a high syngas selectivity (94.8%, 89.0%) accompanied with good methane conversion (93.1% and 95.7%) for methane partial oxidation, and near 100% hydrogen concentrations (higher than 99.6% and 99.5%) for steam splitting, indicating that additional separation step for pure hydrogen acquisition can be omitted. The H2/CO molar ratio was maintained at the optimal value of 2.0 throughout the methane partial oxidation process. Characterizations and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that methane partial oxidation was promoted via an oxygen vacancy-mediated Mars-van-Krevelen type mechanism and the partial oxidation ability of the oxygen carrier is restricted by its content of oxygen vacancy and lattice oxygen migration rate. The proper amount of Ni doping forming the NiFe synergetic effects also contributed highly to methane partial oxidation. Afterward, the deeply reduced metals combined with the oxygen vacancies provided active sites for steam splitting, hence generating pure H2.
