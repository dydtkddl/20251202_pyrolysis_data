You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of CFD, statistical analysis and DoE for optimising H2 generation through ammonia borane catalytic hydrolysis: A novel approach for multiobjective optimisation A non-noble metal catalyst (Cu/NiO/TiO2) was used for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB), studying the effect of temperature, AB concentration and substrate to catalyst (Sub:Cat) molar ratio. A zero-dimensional (0-D) model was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics for the validation of the experimental data, with a maximum error (17 %) observed at the highest studied concentration. Using the Isalos Data Analytics platform, a Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was implemented, studying complex interactions among the three studied parameters on the three critical response variables: reaction time, turnover frequency (TOF), and hydrogen (H2) yield. Main effects plots revealed nonlinear relationships between each factor and the mean of reaction time. Additional experiments were integrated into the statistical analysis, revealing how one parameter or interaction between the studied parameters influence the response values. Sub:Cat was found to be an influential term at all cases. A multiobjective optimisation analysis was conducted to identify optimal experimental conditions, showcasing a consistent trend favouring a temperature of 50 °C, Sub:Cat ratios around 1100–1150, and AB concentrations of 74–78 mM, generating H2 yields above 74.4 % and reaction times below 30 min. Changing one-factor-at-a-time would have required 27 experiments, while with the use of BBD, only 13 experiments were needed to capture the main, quadratic, and interaction effects, reducing the experimental studies by almost 50 %, saving time and consumables.
