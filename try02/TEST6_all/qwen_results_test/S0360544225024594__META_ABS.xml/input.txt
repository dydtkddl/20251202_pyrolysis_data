Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass using desulfurization ash: Enhanced bio-oil yields and reaction pathway modulation This study investigates the use of desulfurization ash (DA), an economical solid waste by-product, as a catalyst in corn cob (CON) pyrolysis to improve bio-oil and syngas yields. The effects of varying DA-to-CON ratios on pyrolysis product distribution were examined using TGA, XRD, XRF, and GC-MS. DA catalysis modified pyrolysis reaction pathways, reducing water and gas yields while enhancing bio-oil production and the generation of high-value phenolic compounds such as phenols and pyridines. It promoted the conversion of lignin and cellulose into aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds, lowering the oxygen content of bio-oil. Additionally, secondary reactions, including decarbonylation and dehydroxylation, produced low-molecular-weight free radicals, further improving product quality. The results demonstrate DA's potential as a sustainable catalyst for biomass pyrolysis, advancing waste valorization and bioenergy development.
