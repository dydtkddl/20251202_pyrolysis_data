You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of different types of waste cooking oil in the presence/absence HZSM-5 catalyst: Influence of feedstock characteristics on aromatic formation In this study, aromatics were prepared by continuous microwave pyrolysis experiment in the presence and absence of HZSM-5 using different types of waste cooking oil (corn oil, rice oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, soybean oil, blending oil, peanut oil, palm oil), and the effects of raw material characteristics on pyrolysis products were compared. The results showed that the fatty acid composition of waste cooking oil affects the composition of pyrolysis products. For example, linoleic acid promotes naphthene and inhibits olefin formation; oleic acid is easy to form C9 and C10 compounds; compared with oleic acid and linoleic acid, palmitic acid is not conducive to deoxidation. In addition, the deoxidation degree of waste cooking oil is related to the raw material H/Ceff, and the order from high to low is corn oil > rapeseed oil > sunflower seed oil > peanut oil > soybean oil. The yield of the oxygen-containing compounds is inversely proportional to it. With the use of HZSM-5 catalyst, the content of toluene and xylene in liquid products is significantly increases, especially the content of xylene. The catalytic effect of rice oil is the most significant, with xylene content increased by 19.2% compared with the non-catalytic pyrolysis. This provides a reference for the efficient treatment of waste oil and the production of aromatics in the future.
