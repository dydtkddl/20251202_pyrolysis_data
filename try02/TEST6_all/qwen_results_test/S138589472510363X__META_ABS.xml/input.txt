Supercritical CO₂ gasification of polyvinyl alcohol for efficient syngas production and enhanced carbon conversion The increasing environmental burden of plastic waste has intensified the pursuit of clean and efficient thermochemical conversion technologies. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), although water-soluble and partially biodegradable, requires low-emission disposal routes due to its growing usage. This study investigates the gasification of PVA in supercritical CO₂ (Sc-CO₂) as a sustainable waste-to-energy strategy. Experiments were performed across a range of temperatures (400–700 °C), residence times, and initial CO₂ pressures (4–7 MPa) to evaluate syngas yield, energy performance, and CO₂ reactivity. The results demonstrated that supercritical CO₂ significantly enhanced gasification, achieving peak carbon and hydrogen efficiencies of 44 % and 53 %, respectively, at 700 °C. The syngas exhibited a peak lower heating value (LHV) of 31.94 MJ/Nm3 at 400 °C, while the energy conversion efficiency (ECE) reached 74 % at 700 °C under the present conditions. Gas-phase analysis revealed selective enrichment of H₂ and CO, while gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed suppressed tar and char formation. A peak CO₂ conversion rate of 21.8 % validated its dual role as reactant and gasifying medium. A temperature-dependent pathway from depolymerization to gas evolution was proposed, with supercritical CO₂ facilitating bond cleavage and carbon recycling. These findings highlight the potential of supercritical CO₂ gasification as a scalable and carbon-reducing approach for polymer waste valorization.
