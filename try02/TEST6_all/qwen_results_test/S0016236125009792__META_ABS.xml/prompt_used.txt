You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen-rich syngas production from the steam co-gasification of low-density polyethylene and coal refuse Gasification provides a promising pathway for transforming waste materials into valuable products, such as fuels and chemicals. This study investigates the steam co-gasification of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and compressed thickener underflow, representative of coal refuse (CR), in a drop tube reactor. The effects of feed blend ratio (0–100 wt% LDPE) and temperature (800–1000 °C) on syngas composition, tar formation, and process efficiency are examined. The high volatility of LDPE makes it more reactive than CR but also promotes the formation of 2–7 ring aromatic tars. Increasing temperature improves carbon conversion efficiency (CCE), cold gas efficiency (CGE), and syngas yield, although the lower heating value (LHV) of syngas decreases. Hydrogen is the dominant gas product, reaching 59 vol% with the H2/CO molar ratio ranging from 2.27 to 4.74. Synergistic effects from alkali and alkali earth metals (AAEMs), particularly K and Ca, in CR ash enhance syngas yield by catalyzing char gasification and tar cracking. Hematite (Fe2O3) and ash from sub-bituminous/bituminous coals are explored as tar reforming catalysts. Fe2O3 achieves 100 % tar reforming efficiency, while coal ash, with a lower Fe2O3 content (15 wt%), is less effective at cracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly naphthalene. These findings demonstrate the flexibility of co-gasification, allowing precise tuning of syngas characteristics for specific downstream applications. Further optimization of waste-derived catalysts could enhance the economic viability of gasification in waste-to-energy processes.
