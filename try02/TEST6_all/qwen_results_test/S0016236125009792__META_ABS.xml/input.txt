Hydrogen-rich syngas production from the steam co-gasification of low-density polyethylene and coal refuse Gasification provides a promising pathway for transforming waste materials into valuable products, such as fuels and chemicals. This study investigates the steam co-gasification of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and compressed thickener underflow, representative of coal refuse (CR), in a drop tube reactor. The effects of feed blend ratio (0–100 wt% LDPE) and temperature (800–1000 °C) on syngas composition, tar formation, and process efficiency are examined. The high volatility of LDPE makes it more reactive than CR but also promotes the formation of 2–7 ring aromatic tars. Increasing temperature improves carbon conversion efficiency (CCE), cold gas efficiency (CGE), and syngas yield, although the lower heating value (LHV) of syngas decreases. Hydrogen is the dominant gas product, reaching 59 vol% with the H2/CO molar ratio ranging from 2.27 to 4.74. Synergistic effects from alkali and alkali earth metals (AAEMs), particularly K and Ca, in CR ash enhance syngas yield by catalyzing char gasification and tar cracking. Hematite (Fe2O3) and ash from sub-bituminous/bituminous coals are explored as tar reforming catalysts. Fe2O3 achieves 100 % tar reforming efficiency, while coal ash, with a lower Fe2O3 content (15 wt%), is less effective at cracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly naphthalene. These findings demonstrate the flexibility of co-gasification, allowing precise tuning of syngas characteristics for specific downstream applications. Further optimization of waste-derived catalysts could enhance the economic viability of gasification in waste-to-energy processes.
