You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influences of operating parameters on the fluidized bed coal gasification process: A coarse-grained CFD-DEM study In the present study, a comprehensive coarse-grained computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is developed for modeling the fluidized bed gasifier. Based on the model validations against experimental measurements, a series of simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of different operating parameters on the coal gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed. This study offers new insights into the effects of gas-solid mixing on the gasification reaction. The results show the non-uniform spatial distributions of the gasification rate in both the horizontal and vertical directions, which reflects the preferential distribution of fuel particles. It is found that the gas back-mixing plays an important role in controlling of the pyrolysis gas combustion, which is undesired for producing gasification products. The results show that the sand particle size has the most remarkable effect on the gas back-mixing. Though the uniformity of the fuel particle distribution is not a key factor influencing the average product yields, the horizontal fuel particle mixing is found to be the main cause of the fluctuations of the gasification rate. Fundamentally, it is demonstrated that the fluctuations of the horizontal fuel mixing are mainly dominated by the bubble behaviors.
