You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a circulating fluidized bed for a 100 kg/day waste plastic pyrolysis-combustion system The aim of this study was to develop a 100 kg/day plastic waste pyrolysis-combustion circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system. The CFB was designed to provide heat from the combustor (semi-riser type) to the pyrolyzer (bubbling fluidized bed (BFB)) through heat carriers in high efficiency. A 100 kg/day scale system, including an oil condensation facility, was constructed and operated continuously for 34.5 hrs. Pelletized polypropylene was supplied to the pyrolyzer as plastic waste. The temperature in the pyrolyzer and plastic feeding rate were experimental variables. The weight percentage of low (C1–C12) and middle (C13–C22) carbon number components of the produced oil in CFB operated at 512-551 °C was 65.3 and 23.2 %, respectively. These were significantly higher than 34.6 and 28.4 % of the BFBs with similar temperatures previously, implying that the heat transfer in the CFB was more intense than that in the BFB. Compared to the BFB, only subtle differences in the pyrolysis gas yield was observed for CFB, which signified that the gas mixing between two reactors was minimized during the operation. Although no blockage was found in the CFB, clogging of condensers and pipelines occurred during low-temperature operation owing to the relatively low pour point of the product oil. The results in this study provide detailed and practical information on the temperature, pressure, product gas, oil, and clogging issues to better understand plastic pyrolysis in CFB.
