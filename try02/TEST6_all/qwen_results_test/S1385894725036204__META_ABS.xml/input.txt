Exploring novel strategies and integrated systems for photothermal catalytic hydrogen production The escalating global energy demand and environmental crises urgently demand transformative strategies for sustainable green hydrogen production. Photothermal catalysis, which uniquely combines thermally activated processes with photoinduced charge generation, has emerged as a critical pathway in renewable energy technologies. This review systematically progresses through three key dimensions: beginning with systematic examination of efficiency-enhancement mechanisms in photothermal hydrogen evolution, followed by architectural innovation analysis of integrated reaction systems for water splitting and organic reforming with particular emphasis on breakthrough advances in energy conversion efficiency and value-added product coupling. Subsequently, the discussion extends to multifunctional system integration, demonstrating synergistic combinations of photothermal hydrogen production with ammonia decomposition, water remediation, and hybrid energy harvesting systems. Critical technical barriers and emerging research frontiers are then rationally analyzed, ultimately presenting an interdisciplinary roadmap that connects fundamental photothermal phenomena with scalable clean energy solutions while advancing material design paradigms for coupled environmental-energy applications.
