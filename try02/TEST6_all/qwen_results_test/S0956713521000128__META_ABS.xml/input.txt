Production of liquid smoke using fluidised-bed fast pyrolysis and its application to green lipped mussel meat Liquid smoke flavouring as an all-natural food additive is usually prepared by smouldering or a carbonisation method. In this study, liquid smoke was prepared by fast pyrolysis technology using a fluidised bed reactor with a yield of 30 wt%. GC-MS analysis showed that main functional compounds were furans, carbonyls and phenols. The fast pyrolysis liquid smoke presented a high antioxidant capacity with a total phenolic content of 21.9 mg GAE/mL. Cytotoxicity analysis indicated that it was as safe as commercial liquid smoke products. This fast pyrolysis liquid smoke was diluted and applied to treat green lipped mussel meat, and the preserving effects were studied over 30-day refrigerated storage. The microbiological analysis results showed bacteria growth was inhibited during the first 14 days of the storage period. The image and texture analysis results showed insignificant changes to liquid smoked mussel meat during storage except for colour darkening and decreased hardness in meat texture.
