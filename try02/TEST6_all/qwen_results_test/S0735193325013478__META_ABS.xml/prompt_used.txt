You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A roadmap for high-performance phase change materials in thermal energy applications Phase change materials (PCMs) hold significant promise for thermal energy storage (TES) due to their high latent heat capacity, but the inherently low thermal conductivity limits heat transfer efficiency and practical deployment. This systematic review, conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, comprehensively examines thirteen key strategies to enhance PCM thermal performance: high-conductivity additives (nanoparticles, carbon-based and metallic fillers), porous structures (metal foams, expanded graphite), finned and extended surface architectures, encapsulation techniques, cascaded or multi-PCM layering, embedded heat pipes, vapor chambers and thermosyphons, mechanical vibration and local oscillation, ultrasonic agitation, jet impingement and fluid injection, magnetic and electric field effects, machine learning (ML) and optimization, and hybrid techniques combining multiple approaches. These strategies improve heat transfer through enhanced conduction, increased surface area, controlled PCM distribution, and optimized system-level integration. The review analyzes underlying mechanisms, benefits, limitations, and applications across diverse domains, including building energy management, solar thermal storage, electronics cooling, automotive battery thermal management, aerospace, deep-ocean energy systems, and industrial waste heat recovery. Key findings highlight that porous metal foams can reduce melting times by up to 85 %, nanoparticle additives can boost thermal conductivity by 300 %, and hybrid fin-porous designs can optimize thermal regulation in batteries and photovoltaic systems. Furthermore, emerging ML and optimization methods accelerate PCM innovation by predicting ideal compositions, fin geometries, and system designs, bridging material-level advances with real-world applications. The review concludes with a strategic roadmap from research to commercialization, providing a holistic framework to guide the development, deployment, and large-scale adoption of enhanced PCM-based TES technologies.
