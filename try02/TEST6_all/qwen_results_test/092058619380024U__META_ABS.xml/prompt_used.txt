You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low temperature oxidation of light hydrocarbons over silica supported noble metal catalysts A steady state oxidation of a natural gas (NG) (95.2 %, methane, 1.2 % ethane, 0.7 % propane, 2.1 %. nitrogen with traces of butane and carbon dioxide) over Pd/SiO2and Pt/SiO2catalysts was run in a temperature range of 553–773 K with a NG to oxygen ratio equal to 9:1 in a flow rector. Water and carbon dioxide were found to be the only products of oxidation at temperatures below 613 K over Pt/SiO2and below 668 K over Pd/SiO2. Above these temperatures hydrogen and carbon monoxides appeared in the products of oxidation. The temperature dependence of the selectivity toward hydrogen for both catalysts is discussed. The interaction of methane pulses with the surface of the preoxidized Pd/SiO2 catalysts at temperature of 543 K was also investigated. The formation of enhanced amounts of CH3 and CH2 species on the oxide surfaces with adsorbed oxygen as well as on oxide surface with deficit of oxygen in the lattice was found. The formation of the enhanced amount of carbon monoxide at the surface of oxide with moderate amount of adsorbed oxygen is considered as a result of the formation and then dehydrogenation of the methoxy species, CH2O, on O− ions.
