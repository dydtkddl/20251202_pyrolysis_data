Enhancing propane direct dehydrogenation performances through temperature induced VOx dispersion and alumina support phase transformation Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are promising candidates for propane direct dehydrogenation. A strategy was developed in the present study to enhance the intrinsic activity and coking-resistance of supported VOx catalysts at the same time. The annealing temperature and VOx surface density were identified as regulation parameters to tailor the dispersion of VOx and micro-environment of V-O-Al active sites. The surface acidic VOx was found capable of inducing local structure rearrangement of transition alumina and the transformation of amorphous δ- to more crystalline θ-alumina at relatively lower temperatures, contributing to lowering VOx-support interactions and enhancing VOx reducibility. The DFT calculations verify that the chemical states of V-O active sites could be tuned by the ligand Al3+ coordination micro-environment, and the octahedral Al3+ serving as ligands contributes to enhancing the reducibility and C–H bond rupture capability of V-O site. The annealing temperature was also found capable of dispersing VOx species over alumina surface with the optimal temperature dependent of specific VOx loadings. As a consequence, the intrinsic activity of 3.1 V/Al2O3-900 and the deactivation rate of 3.1 V/Al2O3-700 with dominantly isolated VOx is 1.4 times and 0.65 times that of 3.1 V/Al2O3-550, respectively.
