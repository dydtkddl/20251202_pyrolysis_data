Graphitic carbon-confined Ru1Con single-atom alloy boosts olefin production from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to olefins (FTO) with remarkable efficiency using cobalt metal catalyst is highly appealing yet encountering a trade-off between activity and olefin selectivity. Herein, we engineered a confined Ru1Con single-atom alloy catalyst featuring a graphitic carbon shell layer, which exhibits at least a 2-fold activity increase compared with all previously reported Co-based catalysts, along with ultralow CO2 selectivity (1.3 %), remarkable olefin selectivity (53.5 %) and long-term stability. Incorporating Ru single atoms into Co nanoparticles can stabilize highly active hexagonal close-packed Co phase by forming Ru1Con alloy, which exhibits much stronger CO adsorption and dissociation capabilities. Moreover, probe experiments and DFT calculations confirmed that it also creates an electron-rich Co active center, altering the CO activation pathway from H-assisted to direct CO dissociation. The surface graphitic carbon promoted olefins desorption and impeded its secondary adsorption, thus boosting olefins production. This work provides an effective confinement and Ru-Co alloy strategy for the rational design of Co metal catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, successfully steering product distribution from benchmark paraffins to high value-added olefins with exceptional efficiency.
