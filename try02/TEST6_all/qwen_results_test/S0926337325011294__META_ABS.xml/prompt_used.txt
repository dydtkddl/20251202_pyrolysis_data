You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphitic carbon-confined Ru1Con single-atom alloy boosts olefin production from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to olefins (FTO) with remarkable efficiency using cobalt metal catalyst is highly appealing yet encountering a trade-off between activity and olefin selectivity. Herein, we engineered a confined Ru1Con single-atom alloy catalyst featuring a graphitic carbon shell layer, which exhibits at least a 2-fold activity increase compared with all previously reported Co-based catalysts, along with ultralow CO2 selectivity (1.3 %), remarkable olefin selectivity (53.5 %) and long-term stability. Incorporating Ru single atoms into Co nanoparticles can stabilize highly active hexagonal close-packed Co phase by forming Ru1Con alloy, which exhibits much stronger CO adsorption and dissociation capabilities. Moreover, probe experiments and DFT calculations confirmed that it also creates an electron-rich Co active center, altering the CO activation pathway from H-assisted to direct CO dissociation. The surface graphitic carbon promoted olefins desorption and impeded its secondary adsorption, thus boosting olefins production. This work provides an effective confinement and Ru-Co alloy strategy for the rational design of Co metal catalysts for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, successfully steering product distribution from benchmark paraffins to high value-added olefins with exceptional efficiency.
