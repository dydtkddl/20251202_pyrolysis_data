Pyrolysis comprehensive gas chromatography and mass spectrometry: A new tool to assess the purity of ancient collagen prior to radiocarbon dating Exogenous carbonaceous contaminants coming from sediments significantly bias the radiocarbon date of collagen samples extracted from archaeological bone and teeth. In this study, a new approach combining pyrolysis, comprehensive gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC × GC/MS) was proposed to ensure their removal during the demineralization and bone collagen extraction. This approach permitted to identify hydrocarbon contaminants for archaeological samples from the Neolithic period, in 30–40 μg of collagen. The use of 2D GC improved importantly the separation, selectivity and resolution compared to 1D GC thus permitting to detect organic contaminants within the complex chromatograms issued from collagen pyrolysis. Moreover, efficiency of the extraction steps in collagen sample preparation for radiocarbon dating (acid and alkali treatments, filtration steps) could be evaluated for four different protocols on the basis of organic contaminant removal. Radiocarbon dating of the extracted collagen of four of the tested protocols corroborated the results of the Py GC × GC/MS data. This approach opens new perspectives for the use of comprehensive gas chromatography in the domain of archaeological sciences.
