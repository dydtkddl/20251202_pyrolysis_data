You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation of chloride products in the MSW (municipal solid wastes) pyrolysis process by Py-GC/MS method with key model components The formation of chloride products in the process for pyrolysis of municipal solid wastes (MSW) with key model components was investigated by Py-GC/MS method. HCl and CH3Cl are identified as the most abundant chloride products for the individual pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or corn straw (CS) in the range of 200–600 °C. For the pyrolysis of CS, a higher temperature is more favorable for the generation of HCl than that of CH3Cl. In the PVC pyrolytic products, chlorobenzene (Ph-Cl), benzyl chloride (Ph-CH2Cl), and 1-(chloroethyl)benzene (Ph-CHClCH3) are also detected but in extremely low amounts. For the co-pyrolysis of PVC/CS, the formation of CH3Cl is significantly promoted. The synergistic effect in the PVC/CS co-pyrolysis process is mainly attributed to the reaction between the HCl derived from PVC and the decomposition products of lignin. The products of Ph-Cl and Ph-CH2Cl are mainly generated from the cyclization of Cl-containing chain species. CH3Cl and Ph-CHClCH3 are mainly generated from secondary reactions between HCl and other pyrolytic products. No remarkable synergistic effect is observed on the formations of chlorides in the co-pyrolysis of PVC/PP (polypropylene), while the generation of Ph-CHClCH3 is significantly enhanced in the co-pyrolysis of PVC/PS (polystyrene).
