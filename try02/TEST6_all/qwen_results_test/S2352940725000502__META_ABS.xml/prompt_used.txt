You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nano high-entropy materials: Controllable synthesis, characterization techniques and thermal/photo catalytic applications Nano high-entropy materials (NHEMs) attracted wide attention in energy conversion engineering due to their unique structure and properties (adjustable composition, multiple active sites and high tolerance, etc.) emerging as novel heterogenous catalysis. It is of significance to conduct controllable synthesis and rational characterization of NHEMs for optimizing and understanding their catalytic performance in research and engineering. To date, besides electrocatalysis, investigations of NHEMs is also at rapid development stage in thermocatalysis and photocatalysis. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the application of NHEMs in thermocatalysis/photocatalysis. Herein, this review firstly presents the typical and emerging strategies for the controllable synthesis and characterizations of NHEMs and illustrate their advantages and disadvantages. Then, the applications of NHEMs in thermocatalysis/photocatalysis (main refer to C1 chemical, CO2 conversion, biomass conversion, and water splitting etc.) and their catalytic mechanism are discussed. Finally, we propose some opening questions and promising research directions. And meanwhile, the research and engineering development trends of NHEMs in thermocatalysis and photocatalysis are proposed. We deem that this review is expected to provide theoretical support and deep comprehension for synthesis and characterization techniques of NHEMs to develop efficient catalysts in thermocatalysis and photocatalysis.
