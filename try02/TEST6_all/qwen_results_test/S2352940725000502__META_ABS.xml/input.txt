Nano high-entropy materials: Controllable synthesis, characterization techniques and thermal/photo catalytic applications Nano high-entropy materials (NHEMs) attracted wide attention in energy conversion engineering due to their unique structure and properties (adjustable composition, multiple active sites and high tolerance, etc.) emerging as novel heterogenous catalysis. It is of significance to conduct controllable synthesis and rational characterization of NHEMs for optimizing and understanding their catalytic performance in research and engineering. To date, besides electrocatalysis, investigations of NHEMs is also at rapid development stage in thermocatalysis and photocatalysis. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the application of NHEMs in thermocatalysis/photocatalysis. Herein, this review firstly presents the typical and emerging strategies for the controllable synthesis and characterizations of NHEMs and illustrate their advantages and disadvantages. Then, the applications of NHEMs in thermocatalysis/photocatalysis (main refer to C1 chemical, CO2 conversion, biomass conversion, and water splitting etc.) and their catalytic mechanism are discussed. Finally, we propose some opening questions and promising research directions. And meanwhile, the research and engineering development trends of NHEMs in thermocatalysis and photocatalysis are proposed. We deem that this review is expected to provide theoretical support and deep comprehension for synthesis and characterization techniques of NHEMs to develop efficient catalysts in thermocatalysis and photocatalysis.
