You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Overview and challenges of the photolytic and photocatalytic splitting of H2S In this article, studies on the photolytic and photocatalytic splitting techniques for the generation of hydrogen from H2S in aqueous and gas phase media under ultraviolet and/or visible light irradiation are reviewed. The kinetics of hydrogen production are also thoroughly discussed as a step towards process scale-up. Our findings indicate that the splitting of gaseous H2S exhibits greater economic potential but shows much slower kinetics than its aqueous phase counterpart. Recent studies have demonstrated that higher efficiency can be attained with manganese sulfide (MnS) photocatalysts compared to cadmium sulfide (CdS), which in the past has been widely recognized as a promising photocatalyst for the production of H2 from aqueous H2S. Finally, the current challenges faced in implementing light-driven H2S splitting and its prospects are highlighted. In particular, it was realized that future work needs to be directed towards the synthesis of novel photocatalysts or the development of reaction conditions that minimize or completely inhibit photo-corrosion, one of the major issues faced during the light-driven production of H2 from H2S in the presence of several photocatalysts. This critical review is envisaged to help fuel the renewed interest in the production of hydrogen through photocatalytic H2S splitting.
