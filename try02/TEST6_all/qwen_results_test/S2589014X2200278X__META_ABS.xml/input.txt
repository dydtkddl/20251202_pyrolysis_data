Understanding the role of modeling and simulation in pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics: A review The valorization of resources from biomass and plastic waste using thermochemical platforms is an innovative approach. Pyrolysis is thermochemical technology that is very effective in the production of fuels and chemical intermediates. It's conducted by conventional heating, solar heating, and microwave-controlled heating. Compared to conventional pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis is more advantageous. The temperature distribution, mass transfer, and heat transfer rates depend on the operation mode through process parameters. The optimization of the pyrolysis process is crucial for scale-up. Computer-assisted modeling and simulation techniques help to develop suitable configurations and experimental methods for better efficiencies. Modeling allows the identification of optimum operating parameters and understanding of transportation mechanisms involved in pyrolysis. Modeling, simulation, and optimization are ideally suited to understanding and analyzing the complex stages of pyrolysis. This review provides insight into existing heat, mass, and momentum transfer models for pyrolysis. The effects of transport properties on pyrolysis are dealt with.
