You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming of waste plastics for enhanced hydrogen/syngas yield using sacrificial tire pyrolysis char catalyst Pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming of waste plastics to produce hydrogen-rich syngas has been investigated using tire char as a sacrificial catalyst in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming reactor system. The simultaneous steam reforming of the pyrolysis volatiles and ‘sacrificial’ steam gasification of tire char increased the overall yield of syngas and hydrogen in the gas products. Manipulating the catalyst temperature, steam input, char catalyst:plastic ratio influenced hydrogen yield. The presence of metals such as Zn, Fe, Ca and Mg in tire char, play a catalytic role in steam reforming reactions. The syngas production achieved when the catalyst temperature was 1000 °C and steam weight hourly space velocity was 8 g h−1 g−1 catalyst was 135 mmol H2 g-1 plastic and 92 mmol CO g-1 plastic. However, increasing the amount of char catalyst (4:1 char catalyst:plastic ratio) enabled hydrogen yields of 211 mmol g-1 plastic and total syngas yields of 360 mmol g-1 plastic to be achieved.
