You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards the development of a novel “bamboo-refinery” concept: Selective bamboo fractionation by means of a microwave-assisted, acid-catalysed, organosolv process This work addresses a novel microwave-assisted, acid-catalysed, organosolv (EtOH/H2O) system for the selective fractionation of bamboo, examining the effects of the temperature (110–190 °C), solvent system (EtOH/H2O) and catalyst amount (0–5 vol.% formic acid) on the process. The statistical analysis of the results revealed that the operating variables have a significant influence on bamboo fractionation, allowing the selective production of (i) a cellulose-rich solid fraction, (ii) a hemicellulose rich water-soluble fraction and (iii) a lignin rich solid fraction. The yields of each of these fractions varied between 51 and 94%, 2 and 23% and 2 and 32%, respectively. Increasing temperature exerted a positive effect on bamboo decomposition, increasing the overall bamboo conversion and influencing the effect that the solvent system (EtOH/H2O) has on the process. At low temperature (110 °C) the solvent system does not have much influence, while a synergetic interaction between EtOH and H2O took place at higher temperatures, which allowed better results to be obtained with EtOH/H2O mixtures than with the pure solvents alone. The effect of the catalyst was relatively weak, being greatest when using a high temperature (190 °C) and high proportions of water (>85 vol.%) in the solvent system. With respect to the properties of each fraction, the cellulose rich solid fraction was made up of un-reacted cellulose (44–83 wt.%), hemicellulose (0–21 wt.%) and lignin (12–34 wt.%); the water-soluble hemicellulose rich fraction consisted of a mixture of oligomers, sugars, carboxylic acids, ketones and furans; and the solid rich lignin fraction comprised high purity (>95 wt.%) organosolv lignin. The optimisation of the process revealed that by using a temperature of 190 °C, a solvent system consisting of 45 vol.% EtOH and 55 vol.% H2O with a concentration of formic acid of 5 vol.% it is possible to fractionate bamboo into a high purity (84 wt.%) cellulose solid fraction, very pure (>95%) organosolv lignin and a rich water-soluble hemicellulose fraction consisting of a mixture of oligomers (27 wt.%), sugars (56 wt.%) and carboxylic acids (14 wt.%); thus converting this process into a very promising method for the selective fractionation of bamboo.
