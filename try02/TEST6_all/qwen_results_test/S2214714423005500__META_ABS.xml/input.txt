Kinetic modeling and cost analysis of coupled ultrasonic processes for the treatment of dairy wastewater Sonolysis with bubble cavitation is an effective tool for the degradation of complex, recalcitrant organic compounds. Thermal and cavitation effects are additive to the breaking of complex bonds in organic contaminants by hydroxyl radicals. Strong oxidants such as persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with their high redox potentials (2.01 and 1.8 V, respectively), are coupled with ultrasound energy for the degradation of contaminants. PS and H2O2 generate S O 4 ̇ and O ̇ H radicals, respectively with higher redox potentials (2.6 and 2.8 V, respectively). Consequently, the radicals are even more active at breaking the strong covalent bonds of the contaminants. Coupled methods in different combinations of coagulation-flocculation, chemical oxidation, and sonication are investigated for the treatment of organic content dairy wastewater. The doses of PS and H2O2 are optimized at 0.75 g/L and 25.5 g/L, respectively. The kinetic study reveals that pseudo-second-order kinetic fits experimental data with a R2 value of 0.99. The oxidation by PS and H2O2, along with ultrasound application, facilitates the removal of COD up to 84.3 % at an economically feasible treatment cost of $5.635 per kg of COD removal. Coupled process is found able to qualify dairy wastewater as dischargeable at a feasible cost of treatment.
