You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic modeling and cost analysis of coupled ultrasonic processes for the treatment of dairy wastewater Sonolysis with bubble cavitation is an effective tool for the degradation of complex, recalcitrant organic compounds. Thermal and cavitation effects are additive to the breaking of complex bonds in organic contaminants by hydroxyl radicals. Strong oxidants such as persulfate (PS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with their high redox potentials (2.01 and 1.8 V, respectively), are coupled with ultrasound energy for the degradation of contaminants. PS and H2O2 generate S O 4 ̇ and O ̇ H radicals, respectively with higher redox potentials (2.6 and 2.8 V, respectively). Consequently, the radicals are even more active at breaking the strong covalent bonds of the contaminants. Coupled methods in different combinations of coagulation-flocculation, chemical oxidation, and sonication are investigated for the treatment of organic content dairy wastewater. The doses of PS and H2O2 are optimized at 0.75 g/L and 25.5 g/L, respectively. The kinetic study reveals that pseudo-second-order kinetic fits experimental data with a R2 value of 0.99. The oxidation by PS and H2O2, along with ultrasound application, facilitates the removal of COD up to 84.3 % at an economically feasible treatment cost of $5.635 per kg of COD removal. Coupled process is found able to qualify dairy wastewater as dischargeable at a feasible cost of treatment.
