You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nox formation in fixed-bed biomass combustion: Chemistry and modeling The renewable and carbon neutral nature of biomass makes it an alternative clean energy resource. However, NOX emission during biomass combustion, a widely used approach for extracting energy from biomass, poses serious environmental concerns. A fundamental investigation of nitrogen species formation mechanism during biomass combustion is important to minimize NOX and nitrous oxide emissions. In this study, a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that combines nitrogen chemistry with flow and combustion simulations is presented. We call this model BASIC: bulk accumulated solids incineration code. BASIC combined sub-models for drying, devolatilization, volatiles combustion, and char oxidation, nitrogen chemistry, and conservation equations. The model is first validated against data on fixed bed combustion of biomass from literature. Results show that particle size and the initial temperature have significant impact on NO and N2O formation, whereas pressure shows a less significant effect. NOX formation mechanism pathways show that the oxidation of ammonia has a significant influence on NO production, while the reduction of NO by surface dominated hydrogen play an important role in reducing its concentration in the gas phase. Net N2O formation is determined both by the reactions of precursors with NO and the process of N2O decomposition to N2. Unlike prior CFD models, BASIC can predict not only N2O formation for biomass combustion, an important greenhouse gas, but also optimal parameters, e.g., particle size and temperature, for the lowest NOX production.
