Ni/SnO2-Al2O3 catalyzed lignin depolymerization via cascade process of methanol aqueous phase reforming and hydrogenolysis Catalytic hydrogenolysis of lignin to value-added chemicals without external H2 has recently received considerable attentions. In this work, Ni supported on the SnO2 modified Al2O3 (Ni/SnO2-Al2O3-x) was used for the hydrogenolysis of organosolv lignin with in situ H2 from the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol. With Ni/SnO2-Al2O3-10, 180.3 mg g−1 yield of monophenols was obtained, which was approximately double of that from the Ni/Al2O3 catalytic system (96.9 mg g−1). Intensive characterizations using H2-TPR, XPS and H2-TPD illustrated that the introduction of SnO2 can affect the interaction between NiO and Al2O3 support, thus modulating the contents of NiSn alloy and Ni metal on catalyst surface. Further reaction mechanism study confirmed that NiSn alloy is conducive to APR of methanol and in situ formed Ni metal is responsible for hydrogenolysis of lignin, the synergistic effect between NiSn alloy and Ni metal promotes the depolymerization of lignin. Therefore, this work provides a new insight into the rational design of catalysts for the lignin hydrogenolysis without external H2.
