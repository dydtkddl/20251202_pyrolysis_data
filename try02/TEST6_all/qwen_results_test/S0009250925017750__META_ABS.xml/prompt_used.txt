You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ni/SnO2-Al2O3 catalyzed lignin depolymerization via cascade process of methanol aqueous phase reforming and hydrogenolysis Catalytic hydrogenolysis of lignin to value-added chemicals without external H2 has recently received considerable attentions. In this work, Ni supported on the SnO2 modified Al2O3 (Ni/SnO2-Al2O3-x) was used for the hydrogenolysis of organosolv lignin with in situ H2 from the aqueous phase reforming (APR) of methanol. With Ni/SnO2-Al2O3-10, 180.3 mg g−1 yield of monophenols was obtained, which was approximately double of that from the Ni/Al2O3 catalytic system (96.9 mg g−1). Intensive characterizations using H2-TPR, XPS and H2-TPD illustrated that the introduction of SnO2 can affect the interaction between NiO and Al2O3 support, thus modulating the contents of NiSn alloy and Ni metal on catalyst surface. Further reaction mechanism study confirmed that NiSn alloy is conducive to APR of methanol and in situ formed Ni metal is responsible for hydrogenolysis of lignin, the synergistic effect between NiSn alloy and Ni metal promotes the depolymerization of lignin. Therefore, this work provides a new insight into the rational design of catalysts for the lignin hydrogenolysis without external H2.
