Collision characteristics and breakage evolution of particles in fluidizing processes Fluidized beds are widely used in chemical reactors. Particles in fluidized bed usually circulate between reactors, and therefore, particle attrition cannot be avoided. Catalyst particle attrition in the fluidized bed significantly shortens their lifespan and raises operating costs. This study established an irregular polyhedron model of the particles to acquire their motion and force characteristics by the Euler-Lagrangian method and then employed the Ab-T10 breakage model to predict the particle's breakage process. The collision frequency and stress characteristics of the three-dimensional surface of a single particle were explored, as well as the time-dependent variations in the collision frequency and impact power between particles. The breakage and elutriation processes of a single particle were observed. The investigation found that the velocity differential between particles was the main factor that caused impact power. The particles were typically crushed one to six times before becoming completely fine powder, and their size evolution can be summarized in three stages. The complete process of particle breakage was revealed by tracing the size evolution of a single particle. This work would contribute to a deeper understanding of particle collision behavior and breakage mechanisms in fluidized beds.
