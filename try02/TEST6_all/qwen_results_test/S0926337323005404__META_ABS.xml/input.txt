Efficient and selective dual-pathway polyolefin hydro-conversion over unexpectedly bifunctional M/TiO2-anatase catalysts The huge scale of plastic waste generation and its environmental consequences drive the demands for catalytic plastic upcycling processes. Here, we report efficient polypropylene (PP) hydro-conversion over Ru and Ni supported on a sol-gel anatase TiO2 (TiO2-A-SG). A small number of Brønsted acid sites on TiO2-A-SG enables hydrocracking, improving efficiency, steering the selectivity towards high-valued C4–20, and allowing more isomerization, compared to Ru-based monofunctional hydrogenolysis catalysts. The relative contribution of hydrocracking increases with lower hydrogen partial pressure, more branched substrates, and lower Ru loading. Ni/TiO2-A-SG exhibits superior hydrocracking activity and selectivity to Ni on conventional Brønsted-acidic supports, particularly zeolites. Mechanistic studies shows fast isomerization and sequential β-scissions caused by strong polymer-catalyst interaction and fast cracking with abundant 3C. This favors C4–12 formation and prevents secondary reactions. This work demonstrated a novel, highly efficient noble-metal-free catalyst for plastic waste upcycling, while advancing the mechanistic understanding of polyolefin hydro-conversion.
