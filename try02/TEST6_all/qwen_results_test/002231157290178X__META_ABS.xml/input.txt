Factors affecting stress corrosion cracking of zircaloy in iodine vapour Zircaloy stressed in tension may crack, predominantly transgranularly, in iodine vapour at temperatures commonly found in water-cooled reactor fuel sheaths (around 300°C). Since iodine is quite an abundant fission product and tensile stresses can arise in fuel sheaths due to thermal expansion of UO2 fuel or fission gas pressure, a study was made of metallurgical and environmental variables that could affect cracking. These include applied stress, residual stress, crystallographic texture, cold work, irradiation history, catalysts and iodine concentration.
