Kinetic regulation of Brønsted and Lewis acidity in FAU-type zeolites for olefin-selective plastic waste cracking The selective catalytic cracking of polyethylene (PE) into light olefins offers a sustainable route for plastic upcycling. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the strength and distribution of Brønsted (BAS) and Lewis (LAS) acid sites in FAU-type zeolites via kinetic regulation can dramatically influence activity and selectivity in PE cracking. Increasing crystallization time and temperature promoted the dislodging of framework Al, weakening BAS while enriching LAS, as confirmed by 27Al/29Si MAS NMR, XRD, NH3-TPD, and pyridine-FTIR analysis. The optimized HY-48h catalyst achieved ∼39 % yield of light olefins (C2 =-C4 =) and only ∼4.5 % coke, effectively doubling olefin output and reducing coke to one-fourth compared to conventional HY zeolite. Acidic properties-product distribution analysis revealed that weak BAS and increased LAS content promotes monomolecular β-scission over bimolecular cracking pathways, thereby enhancing light olefins production. Notably, the catalytic activity of the zeolites in PE degradation was closely linked to the strength of BAS. Furthermore, HY-48h maintained its performance in the cracking of HDPE and real post-consumer plastic waste, presenting strong catalytic resilience even in the presence of inorganic impurities. These findings highlight the critical role of acid site engineering in decoupling olefin formation from coke generation, offering a practical route to design zeolites for efficient, selective plastic waste valorization.
