You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorisation scenarios of blended post-consumer textile waste with the focus on thermal processing strategies Blended textiles present significant challenges for recycling due to the differing physical and chemical properties of natural and synthetic polymers. While current strategies for recycling mono-material textile waste are relatively well-developed and often more straightforward than those for the blended fabrics, in many cases they are limited to downcycling. Consequently, mono-blend recycling approaches are still evolving through advancements in sorting technologies, innovative chemical processing methods, and emerging biochemical techniques. In contrast, valorization approaches for blended textile waste remain largely underexplored, hindering progress in both research and industrial applications. This review explores the challenges and opportunities associated with valorizing blended textile waste, focusing on post-consumer fiber blends such as polycotton. It compares various reprocessing methods, emphasizing thermochemical techniques – including pyrolysis, torrefaction, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification. Unlike mechanical, chemical, or biochemical approaches, thermochemical processes are highly adaptable to diverse feedstocks of varying quality and can yield valuable products such as biofuels, chemicals, and filtration materials. Pyrolysis and torrefaction are particularly suitable for decentralized applications, as they require less complex equipment and generate locally applicable products like activated carbon, bio-oil, and syngas. This review highlights the critical role of thermochemical processes in promoting sustainable, localized waste valorization and enhancing the utilization of complex textile waste streams.
