You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvolysis and oxidative liquefaction of the end-of-life composite wastes as an element of the circular economy assumptions In pursuit of sustainable development, recycling composite waste is a crucial challenge as well as an opportunity to support the progress towards eco-friendly materials management and circular economy practices. The current study brings together two modern recycling techniques solvolysis and oxidative liquefaction to recycle five types of composite waste materials including wind turbine blades (WTBs), composite pipes, personal protective equipment (PPEs) used in the medical sector, photovoltaic (PV) panels and municipal solid waste (MSW). Following a well-structured experimental design for each type of waste the solvolysis was performed at a temperature range of 100–190 °C, process time within the range of 1–3 h, and catalyst (TBD) concentration within the range of 0.015–0.025 mol, end with ethylene glycol and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in a 1:1 M ratio, while depending on the material evaluated, the oxidative liquefaction process was conducted at temperatures between 250 and 350 °C for WTB and between 200 and 300 °C for PPE, MSW, and PV. Oxidant concentrations, reaction time and pressure (15–45%, 30–90 min, 20–40 bar for WTBs, 30–60%, 45 min, 30 bar for remaining waste types) were studied in addition to highly variant waste-to-liquid ratio from 5 to 25% for WTB, 3–7% for PPE and MSW, and 12.5–37.5 for PV. Prior to experimental investigation, surface morphologies and chemical studies of the waste material were performed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy, while after experimentation total polymer degradation (TPD) was calculated and liquid products were analysed through gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID). Following the solvolysis, 50–60% TPD was obtained, allowing for the recovery of glass fibres (GF) with average lengths of 50–60 mm and a maximum length of 650 mm. This allowed for the recovery of GFs with average lengths of 50–60 mm and a maximum length of 650 mm. In the case of oxidative liquefaction, total polymer degradation of 72–100%, 52–100% and 55–100% was achieved, depending on the investigated waste, i.e. WTB, PPE and MSW, respectively. The yield of oxygenated chemical compounds depended upon the types and composition of waste, but acetic acid was the main acid while WTB, PPE, and MSW, the liquid samples contained phenol also. Involved chemistry and possible degradation pathways of complex composite wastes are discussed in detail to enhance the recycling process and material recovery.
