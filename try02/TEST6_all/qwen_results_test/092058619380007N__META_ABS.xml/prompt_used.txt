You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Activity of different metal oxides towards COS hydrolysis. Effect of SO2 and sulfation Activity measurements for COS hydrolysis were carried out at 503 K for three metal oxides : ZrO2, TiO2 and Al2O3. Taking the surface areas into account, their activity varied in the following order : ZrO2 ⪢ Al2O3 ⪢ TiO2a. COS adsorption, studied by IR spectroscopy, showed that type I OH groups, the most basic, were the catalytic sites and gave rise to hydrogen-thiocarbonate species. Such sites can be detected by CO2 adsorption through the formation of hydrogen-carbonate species which are indeed more abundant on ZrO2 than on TiO2 or Al2O3. The presence of SO2 in the gas feed substantially decreased the catalytic activity whatever the sample. A less pronounced deactivation was observed on TiO2. This effect was reversible and is described as a competitive adsorption between SO2 and COS on the basic hydroxyl sites. Catalyst sulfation, either provoked by sulfate impregnation on the pure oxides or by injection of O2 pulses during the reaction, irreversibly decreased the activity. However, ZrO2 remained the most active. This poisoning effect was found irreversible and explained by the creation of Brönsted acidity.
