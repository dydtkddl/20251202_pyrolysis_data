You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A modulated-TGA approach to the kinetics of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis/combustion Microcrystalline cellulose, Birchwood xylan, and Organosolv lignin were selected as the representatives of the three major components in lignocellulosic biomass: cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, respectively. The thermal decompositions, both pyrolysis and combustion, of these biomass components as well as a natural woody biomass (Acer saccharum) were investigated using High-Resolution Modulated TGA. The activation energies of each decomposition process were determined by Modulated TGA without any assumptions and mathematical model fitting. For the combustion of microcrystalline cellulose, the char residues underwent glowing ignition due to the presence of oxygen, and its first derivative of weight loss curve showed two thermal decomposition peaks, while only a single peak was observed for pyrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in a nitrogen atmosphere. However, the effect of air was less evident in the thermal degradation of the Birchwood xylan. With air as the sample environment in the TGA experiment, the thermal decomposition of Organosolv lignin was simplified, and the onset of the primary decomposition shifted to temperatures greater than 300 °C, the decomposition zone became narrower, and the mass of residual solids at 600 °C was negligible. Since the sum of the TGA profiles (in air) of the three major biomass components closely matched the TGA profile (in air) of an actual wood sample (A. saccharum), the potential of using TGA to predict biomass compositions was indicated.
