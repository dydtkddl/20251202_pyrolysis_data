You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanomaterials in coatings: A review focusing thin film photovoltaic solar cells Surface engineering of thin films in multiple applications have gained immense attention due to advancement in nanotechnology, fabrication and synthesis of nanomaterials. Thin film solar cells are at the forefront of the renewable energy harvesting, they offer numerous benefits over traditional counterparts which have lower efficiencies and stability, rapid degradation, higher cost and reduced lifetime. Carbon nanomaterials are unique materials comprising desirable properties for the application in thin film solar cells making them potential material for photovoltaic application. This review highlights the common mechanisms used for deposition of carbon and thin film layer formation in solar cells, namely physical and chemical vapor deposition. Both at the research and industrial scales, high production yields are easier to attain through vapor deposition methods, as a result, these approaches have a clear cost benefit over solution processing. It also discusses about the carbon nanomaterials (graphene and nanotubes) applied in different solar cell configurations and their subsequent contributions in enhancement of cell performance. Carbon nanomaterials offer comparatively inexpensive and effective way for enhancing absorption of solar radiation and also the overall stability in thin film solar cell. Inexpensive synthesis of defect free engineered carbon nanomaterials based thin film solar cells provides positive outlook for the industry. More research efforts should be given to environmental considerations for both, carbon synthesis and cell fabrication methods.
