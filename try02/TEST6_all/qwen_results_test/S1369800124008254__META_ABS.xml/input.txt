Carbon nanomaterials in coatings: A review focusing thin film photovoltaic solar cells Surface engineering of thin films in multiple applications have gained immense attention due to advancement in nanotechnology, fabrication and synthesis of nanomaterials. Thin film solar cells are at the forefront of the renewable energy harvesting, they offer numerous benefits over traditional counterparts which have lower efficiencies and stability, rapid degradation, higher cost and reduced lifetime. Carbon nanomaterials are unique materials comprising desirable properties for the application in thin film solar cells making them potential material for photovoltaic application. This review highlights the common mechanisms used for deposition of carbon and thin film layer formation in solar cells, namely physical and chemical vapor deposition. Both at the research and industrial scales, high production yields are easier to attain through vapor deposition methods, as a result, these approaches have a clear cost benefit over solution processing. It also discusses about the carbon nanomaterials (graphene and nanotubes) applied in different solar cell configurations and their subsequent contributions in enhancement of cell performance. Carbon nanomaterials offer comparatively inexpensive and effective way for enhancing absorption of solar radiation and also the overall stability in thin film solar cell. Inexpensive synthesis of defect free engineered carbon nanomaterials based thin film solar cells provides positive outlook for the industry. More research efforts should be given to environmental considerations for both, carbon synthesis and cell fabrication methods.
