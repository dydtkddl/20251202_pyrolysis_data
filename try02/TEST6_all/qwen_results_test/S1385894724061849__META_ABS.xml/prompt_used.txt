You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of nickel and alkaline earth metals interaction on sustainable carbon nanotubes generation from plastic face masks via catalytic pyrolysis The one-pot synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) emerges as a promising approach for plastic valorization, owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, limited attention has been given to catalyst design for this method, particularly regarding the influence of Group 2 alkaline earth metal elements (X) on the Ni-based catalyst activity. This study investigates the impact of X on the catalytic activity of Ni towards sustainable CNTs synthesis using plastic face masks. The findings revealed that X influenced the carbon yield of NiMo-X catalysts and the morphology of the resultant carbon nanomaterials. Notably, NiMo-Ca demonstrated the highest carbon yield, whereas NiMo-Mg and NiMo-Ba exhibited the lowest. Furthermore, NiMo-Mg tends to produce clean and thin CNTs, while NiMo-Ba tends to yield carbon flakes with numerous irregular cokes. In addition to the effect of Ni crystallite size, which influences the transition from tubular to flake-like carbon structures, environmental factors are also considered. Specifically, NiMo-Mg generated a high CO2/CH4 environment, while NiMo-Ba exhibited slower catalytic cracking of polymeric chains from face masks, both of which were unfavorable for CNTs growth. Conversely, NiMo-Ca facilitated higher carbon recovery, likely due to its creation of a low CO2/CH4 environment via CO2 methanation. Optimization studies indicated that increasing pyrolysis temperatures and durations lead to reduced carbon yield, while cyclic pyrolysis of face masks up to five iterations enhances the reusability of NiMo-X catalysts with improved carbon recovery. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the early pyrolytic gas formation and carbon nucleation phase, which are influenced by the surface Ni fraction and Ni polarization, as well as the later CNTs growth phase, which is related to the Ni crystallite size.
