You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocarbons recovery through catalytic pyrolysis of compostable and recyclable waste plastics using a novel desk-top staged reactor The overall objective of this study is to develop a novel two-staged fixed-bed reactor to evaluate the catalytic pyrolysis of recyclable (HDPE) and compostable waste plastics and to enhance the selectivity of gasoline range hydrocarbons in pyrolysis liquid. In this research, both used and unused compostable bioplastics, recyclable high-density polyethylene (HDPE) grocery bags, and unused HDPE were used as a feedstock Additionally, a mixture of recyclable plastic and compostable bioplastic with 1:1 ratio was pyrolyzed at 500 °C, and the pyrolysis oil products were compared with commercial gasoline. Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) was used as a catalyst in all the catalytic pyrolysis experiments, which produced wax-free shorter chain hydrocarbons similar to commercial gasoline. The addition of recyclable HDPE in compostable plastics improved the selectivity of gasoline range hydrocarbon ( C 6 − C 12 ) by 10% and increased the calorific value of pyrolysis liquids by 7.5% (43 MJ/kg), which is equivalent to commercial gasoline. Moreover, both compostable and recyclable plastics produced aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons that have potential applications in lubricants, additives, and petrochemical industries.
