You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam reforming of phenol toward cleaner hydrogen production over bimetallic Ni/Ti modified zinc titanate perovskite in tandem with a kinetic model development Hydrogen as a clean energy carrier with high heat combustion and zero environmental impacts is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. In this study, NiO/TiO2 modified ZnTiO3 perovskite (NTZ) with high reducibility catalyst was designated by co-precipitation method and examined in the reaction of steam reforming of phenol (SRP) for H2 production. The activity tests for SRP were carried out in a fixed bed reactor (FBR) under different operating conditions. The NTZ-composite consisting of NiO/TiO2 loaded ZnTiO3 perovskite achieved the highest yield of H2 and phenol conversion of ~76 and 90%, respectively, with excellent durability and time on stream (50 h) stability without obvious deactivation. The high exposed active sites of NiO/TiO2 metals over the bi-metal support (ZnTiO3) and the metal-support interaction significantly improved the catalytic performance. The products distribution of H2, CO2, and CO as a measure of the dominant reactions; SRP, water gas shift (WGS), and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) were correlated to kinetic models and developed according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) expressions. LHHW model accurately fitting the experimental results with surface reactions as the kinetic limitations. SRP reaction revealed the highest rate constant of 21.70 mol g-cat−1 h−1 atm−1 with 39.96 kJ mol-1 activation energy. NTZ is a promising catalyst for the SRP reaction toward H2 production with minimum kinetic limitations and would be promising in the clean energy production and other environmental applications.
