Review on the progress in the production of aromatic hydrocarbons by co-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastics Aromatic hydrocarbons, especially monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), are important basic raw materials in the chemical industry, which are mainly derived from the catalytic reforming and thermal cracking of fossil fuels. The co-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastic to produce aromatics has the advantages of high efficiency, environmental protection, low cost, and high selectivity. It can solve the problems of pyrolysis products such as high oxygen content, low aromatics yield, and low selectivity, which are caused by the characteristics of biomass rich in oxygen and poor in hydrogen. This article reviewed the research progress of co-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastics to prepare aromatic compounds. Firstly, the types of raw materials for co-catalytic pyrolysis were introduced, and then the co-catalytic pyrolysis catalysts were emphasized. The reaction mechanisms of co-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastics, such as the synthesis of dienes and hydrocarbon pool synergy were summarized. Finally, the future research focus and development direction of co-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastics were proposed, which is developing the highly active and stable modified molecular sieve catalysts in order to improve the aromatics yield.
