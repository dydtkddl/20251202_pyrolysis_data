You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of MWCNTs from plastic wastes: Method selection through Multi-Criteria Decision-Making techniques Background The global challenge of plastic waste generation warrants innovative, cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable solutions. Conversion of different non-recyclable plastic waste into value-added products (waste to wealth) such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, carbon black, etc. holds significant promise in the waste management/valorization sectors with economic viability. This study focuses on identifying the optimal method for producing multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) from plastic wastes from several popular MWCNT synthesis methods such as chemical vapor deposition, pyrolysis, spray pyrolysis, gasification, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, etc. Methods The authors implemented Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. They ranked different MWCNT production methods from waste plastic based on several operational, economic, and qualitative parameters, including raw material cost, operating temperature, reaction time, pressure, production yield, and MWCNT diameter. MCDM methods like TOPSIS, Grey Relational Analysis, and Simple Additive Weighting rank different synthesis processes. Findings MCDM analysis performed using subjective and objective criteria weighting concluded that gasification is the most sustainable and cost-effective method having a high assessment score above 0.9 for MWCNT production. In contrast, pyrolysis and spray pyrolysis are the least favoured options with an assessment score ranging between 0.3 to 0.6. The current research provides a clear roadmap for developing a sustainable, economically viable solution for plastic waste valorization. It also helps us to find sustainable and efficient MWCNT manufacturing techniques from non-recyclable plastic waste that have the potential to pave the way for greener sustainable waste management.
