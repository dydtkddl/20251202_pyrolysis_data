Response mechanism of non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate microplastics and biodegradable polylactic acid microplastics to nitrogen removal in activated sludge system The issue of microplastics (MPs) has gained more attention among researchers and the public; however, there is still a lot to be studied about its impact on biological wastewater treatment. In this study, the effects of non-biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) on wastewater treatment by sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were compared. The results showed that PET and PLA reduced the removal efficiency of NH4 +-N by 1.7 % and 21.2 %, respectively. Structural equation functional model (SEM) analysis was used to infer the potential mechanism of PLA affecting ammonia oxidation. PLA primarily inhibits the activity of ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), while promoting an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzyme activity. Accordingly, the toxic effect of PLA further reduced the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. This study showed that biodegradable MPs have a greater potential impact on wastewater treatment than non-biodegradable MPs, which warrants further investigation.
