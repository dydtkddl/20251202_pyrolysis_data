You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Methods for the conversion of biomass waste into value-added carbon nanomaterials: Recent progress and applications Herein, we deliberate the recent progress and innovative modifications which were carried out during the last ten years as commonly employed methods for the conversion of biomass and related feedstocks into carbon nanosystems. Several highlighted methods are described in individual sections comprising: the type of nanomaterial processing, experimental conditions and factors affecting the yield and the characteristics of the final product. We have reconnoitred the applicability of specific feedstocks, advantages and drawbacks of the methods used for the conversion of biomass waste. A remarkable focus has been made to explore synthesis of graphene and graphene-like porous materials (with specific surface area greater than 1000 m2 g−1) which were derived from biomass. Their prospective applications dedicated to smart materials and cutting-edge technologies are also described in each section. To maintain the readability and cover the previous stimulating works on carbon nanomaterials derived from biomass, the first section of this review recaps the present status of carbon nanomaterials derived from biomass and related precursors, chiefly for the application in electrochemical devices, catalysis, sensing, absorbent along with an ample bibliography for further reading. We believe that vast scientific data in this state-of-the-art, simple explanations with schematic diagrams and key future challenges will provide a solid platform to readers about the update in carbon materials derived from biomass waste.
