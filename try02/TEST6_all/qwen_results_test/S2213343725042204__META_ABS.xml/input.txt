Improving polylactic acid plastic biodegradation under thermophilic anaerobic conditions using nanobubble water Polylactic acid (PLA), as the bioplastic with the highest global production capacity, is widely used in food packaging and other fields due to its biodegradability. PLA is typically degraded through anaerobic digestion (AD), but the process is slow and may inhibit AD efficiency. This study investigated the promoting effects and mechanisms of nanobubble water (NBW) as an additive on PLA degradation in thermophilic co-digestion system of cattle manure and Chinese cabbage waste. Experimental results demonstrated that the addition of NBW significantly accelerated PLA degradation, with the maximum weight loss rate reduced by 1.85 %-21.03 % compared with the control group. The peak intensities of PLA's main functional groups and the number-average molecular weight (Mn) decreased by 8.45 %-28.71 % and 11.53 %-42.97 %, respectively, compared with the control, while surface roughness became more pronounced. The findings confirm that nanobubble water enhances the hydrolysis of PLA, thereby improving its degradation efficiency.
