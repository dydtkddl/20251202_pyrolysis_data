You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improving cellulose viscosity protection and delignification in ozone bleaching of low-consistency pulp with water-soluble chitosan The effect of water-soluble chitosan (WSC) with molecular weights (Mw) from 1.0×104 to 1.0×106 on cellulose viscosity protection was explored during the treatment of low-consistency pulp with the ozone bleaching process (OBP). Through determination of the change in crystallinity, carboxyl content, and physical strength of ozone-bleached refined dissolving pulp, WSC was shown to effectively protect cellulose viscosity by scavenging free radicals and forming a protective film deposited on the fiber surface to prevent the destruction of cellulose by oxidants. During the OBP of sulfate hardwood pulp (SHP), application of a 0.5 % dose of WSC with a Mw of 1.0×105 increased not only the cellulose viscosity but also the selectivity of ozone delignification. The brightness, viscosity, and delignification selectivity of the bleached SHP were enhanced by 3.88±0.05 %, 13.0±0.10 %, and 76.6±0.50 %, respectively. Accordingly, the indexes of tensile strength, burst strength and tear strength of the resulting SHP hand sheet were increased by 38.6±1.0 %, 74.8±1.5 %, and 117.3±2.5 %, respectively. WSC had the best performance among the reported additives of equal weights for protection of cellulose viscosity in improving the pulp qualities after the OBP.
