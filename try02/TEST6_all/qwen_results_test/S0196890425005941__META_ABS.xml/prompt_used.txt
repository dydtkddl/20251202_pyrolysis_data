You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential of thermal energy storage for endothermic reconversion of hydrogen carriers In resource-poor industrial countries with high energy consumption, a significant proportion of future energy will likely be imported by ships using chemical hydrogen carriers. The considered hydrogen (H2) derivatives − liquefied natural gas, methanol, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and ammonia − undergo considerable conversion losses during endothermic reconversion to H2 in the importing country. Currently, these losses have been accepted and scientific research on approaches to increase conversion efficiency remains limited. This study introduces a novel concept for externally supplying conversion heat using local renewable electricity through a power-to-heat and high-temperature thermal energy storage system (HT-TES-P2H system). The advantages and disadvantages, along with key figures for the four H2 derivatives, as well as the thermal and process-related integration of an HT-TES-P2H system into the endothermic processes, were analysed systematically. Suitable heat integration concepts were identified for all four H2 carriers; ammonia was thermodynamically modelled in detail. For ammonia a majority of the endothermic heat can be provided by an HT-TES-P2H system and hydrogen yield increases from 80 to 96 %. Japanese and German energy systems were analysed to identify potential savings and suitable locations for implementing the concept. A simplified capital cost analysis was carried out for ammonia production in Brazil and Australia with import to Germany. Overall, our novel concept indicates that the addition of a relatively inexpensive HT-TES-P2H system in the importing country results in significantly greater capital expenditure savings of 16.7 % by reducing the size of the entire ammonia supply chain.
