Potential of thermal energy storage for endothermic reconversion of hydrogen carriers In resource-poor industrial countries with high energy consumption, a significant proportion of future energy will likely be imported by ships using chemical hydrogen carriers. The considered hydrogen (H2) derivatives − liquefied natural gas, methanol, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and ammonia − undergo considerable conversion losses during endothermic reconversion to H2 in the importing country. Currently, these losses have been accepted and scientific research on approaches to increase conversion efficiency remains limited. This study introduces a novel concept for externally supplying conversion heat using local renewable electricity through a power-to-heat and high-temperature thermal energy storage system (HT-TES-P2H system). The advantages and disadvantages, along with key figures for the four H2 derivatives, as well as the thermal and process-related integration of an HT-TES-P2H system into the endothermic processes, were analysed systematically. Suitable heat integration concepts were identified for all four H2 carriers; ammonia was thermodynamically modelled in detail. For ammonia a majority of the endothermic heat can be provided by an HT-TES-P2H system and hydrogen yield increases from 80 to 96 %. Japanese and German energy systems were analysed to identify potential savings and suitable locations for implementing the concept. A simplified capital cost analysis was carried out for ammonia production in Brazil and Australia with import to Germany. Overall, our novel concept indicates that the addition of a relatively inexpensive HT-TES-P2H system in the importing country results in significantly greater capital expenditure savings of 16.7 % by reducing the size of the entire ammonia supply chain.
