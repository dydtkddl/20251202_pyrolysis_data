You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High hydrogen permselective carbon molecular sieve membrane and its structural formation mechanism A novel hydroxyl-containing polyetherimide (named BAHPPF-ODPA) with highly aromatic backbone and contorted chain conformation was designed and synthesized as the precursor to fabricate carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) for H2/N2 separation. The structural evolution from polymeric precursor to carbon during pyrolysis was investigated using characterization techniques combined with pyrolysis simulation. And the relationship between membrane structure formation and their separation performance was explored here. Results indicate that the generation and evolution of pyrolysis products including formed fragments and gases, which depend on the precursor chemistry and pyrolysis conditions, exhibited a significant influence on microstructure and performance of derived CMSMs. Designing precursors with an aromatic backbone and contorted structure and precisely tuning pyrolysis temperature allows the fabrication of CMSMs with controllable micropore structure and excellent H2 separation performance. The BAHPPF-ODPA derived CMSM pyrolyzed at 600 °C exhibited the high H2 permeability of about 3500 Barrer and the superior H2/N2 selectivity of more than 400 were obtained after 750 h of long-term mixed gas (75:25 mixture of H2/N2) testing, showing promising application prospects. The experimental and simulation results obtained here would be beneficial to understand the CMS formation and reasonable to design the precursor molecular structure for fabrication of high-performance CMSMs.
