You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2 reduction by chars obtained by pyrolysis of real wastes: Low temperature adsorption and high temperature CO2 capture In this work, the carbon dioxide capture of waste derived chars was investigated. The char samples were obtained by pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste, biomass and sewage sludge from agriculture at 400, 600 and 900 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. For further experiments, chars with a grain size between 0.315 mm and 1.50 mm were investigated. The CO2 uptake capacity of samples was tested at 40 °C through a 10 adsorption-desorption cycles using a mixture of 70 % nitrogen and 30 % carbon dioxide. The CO2 uptake capacity of the reference activated carbon was 3.71–3.90 mmol CO2/g, while that of the waste derived char samples varied between 0.76–2.33 mmol CO2/g depending on the pyrolysis temperature and the raw materials. Chars with large specific surface area obtained at 900 °C had the highest CO2 uptake capacity. Char obtained from municipal plastic waste at a pyrolysis temperature of 900 °C has the largest specific surface area. The biomass and sewage sludge derived chars contained alkali metals and earth metals in oxide form, therefore the possibility of their application for carbonization-calcination cycles was also investigated. In case of the high-temperature tests, the CO2 uptake took place at 750 °C, while the release at 900 °C. During the 10 cycles test, significant decrease in capacity up to the 5th cycle was found. The capacity of char obtained from agricultural sewage sludge was 18.68 mmol CO2/g in the first cycle, which decreased drastically to 2.88–2.96 mmol CO2/g after the 5th cycle.
