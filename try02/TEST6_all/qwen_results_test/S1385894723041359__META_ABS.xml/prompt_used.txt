You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into the pyrolysis mechanisms of epoxy resin polymers based on the combination of experiments and ReaxFF-MD simulation Epoxy resin offers promising properties in composites, while its cross-linked structure prevents the disposal of waste composites. Pyrolysis is an essential technique for the breakdown of epoxy resin polymers, but the fundamental reaction mechanisms need to be clarified. In this study, the combination of experimental studies and the reactive force field molecular dynamic (ReaxFF-MD) simulation were performed to determine the formation mechanisms of pyrolysis products considering the secondary reactions of intermediates. The pyrolysis process was divided into the cleavage and polycondensation stages based on the carbon atom numbers of the largest cluster. The cleavage stage began with the removal of side-chain substituents, followed by the breakdown of the primary epoxy resin chain, resulting in the generation of pyrolysis gas products, of which the OH, C-C-O, and CH3 groups were identified as the critical intermediates in the creation of H2O, CO, and CH4, respectively. Meanwhile, the simultaneous evolution of liquid pyrolysis products (bisphenol A, phenol, and benzene) was established. After the epoxy resin chains were completely cracked, the unsaturated hydrocarbon intermediates underwent the dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions, causing the formation of pyrolysis char and the continuous generation of H2, H2O, and CO. The findings could provide some guidance to selectively regulate the pyrolysis of epoxy resin matrix composites.
