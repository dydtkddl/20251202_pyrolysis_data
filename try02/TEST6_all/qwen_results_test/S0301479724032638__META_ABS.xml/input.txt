A review on the role of various machine learning algorithms in microwave-assisted pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass waste The fourth industrial revolution will heavily rely on machine learning (ML). The rationale is that these strategies make various business operations in many sectors easier. ML modeling is the discovery of hidden patterns between multiple process parameters and accurately predicting the test values. ML has provided a wide range of applications in Chemical Engineering. One major application of ML can be found in the microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of lignocellulose bio-waste. MAP is an energy-efficient technology to obtain high-saturated hydrogen-rich liquid fuels. The main focus of this review study is understanding the utilization of various types of ML algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised techniques in microwave-assisted heating techniques for diverse biomass feedstocks, including waste materials like used tea powder, wood blocks, kraft lignin, and others. In addition to developing effective ML-based models, alternative traditional modeling approaches are also explored. In addition to various thermochemical conversion processes for biomass, MAP is also briefly reviewed with several case studies from the literature. The conventional modeling methodology for biomass pyrolysis with microwave heating is also discussed for comparison with ML-based modeling methodologies.
