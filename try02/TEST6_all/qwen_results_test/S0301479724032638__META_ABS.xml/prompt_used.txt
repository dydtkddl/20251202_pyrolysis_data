You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the role of various machine learning algorithms in microwave-assisted pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass waste The fourth industrial revolution will heavily rely on machine learning (ML). The rationale is that these strategies make various business operations in many sectors easier. ML modeling is the discovery of hidden patterns between multiple process parameters and accurately predicting the test values. ML has provided a wide range of applications in Chemical Engineering. One major application of ML can be found in the microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of lignocellulose bio-waste. MAP is an energy-efficient technology to obtain high-saturated hydrogen-rich liquid fuels. The main focus of this review study is understanding the utilization of various types of ML algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised techniques in microwave-assisted heating techniques for diverse biomass feedstocks, including waste materials like used tea powder, wood blocks, kraft lignin, and others. In addition to developing effective ML-based models, alternative traditional modeling approaches are also explored. In addition to various thermochemical conversion processes for biomass, MAP is also briefly reviewed with several case studies from the literature. The conventional modeling methodology for biomass pyrolysis with microwave heating is also discussed for comparison with ML-based modeling methodologies.
