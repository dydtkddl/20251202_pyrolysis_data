Limited exposure of captive Australian marsupials to plastics The global concern regarding the ubiquitous presence of plastics in the environment has led to intensified research on the impact of these materials on wildlife. In the Australian context, marsupials represent a unique and diverse group of mammals, yet little is known about their exposures to plastics. This study aimed to assess the contamination levels of seven common plastics (i.e., polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) in both the diet and faeces of kangaroos, wallabies and koalas sampled from a sanctuary in Northeastern Australia. Quantitative analysis was performed by pressurized liquid extraction followed by double-shot microfurnace pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the analysis of the food and faeces samples revealed the absence of detectable plastic particles; with this preliminary finding suggesting a relatively limited exposure of captive Australian marsupials to plastics. This study contributes valuable insights into the current state of plastic contamination in Australian marsupials, shedding light on the limited exposures and potential risks, and highlighting the need for continued monitoring and conservation efforts. The results underscore the importance of proactive measures to mitigate plastic pollution and protect vulnerable wildlife populations in Australia's unique ecosystems.
