You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Supercritical water Co-gasification of biomass and plastic wastes for hydrogen-rich gas production using Ni-Cu/AC-CaO catalyst Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of sugar beet pulp (SBP) as lignocellulosic biomass and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as plastic waste to produce hydrogen-rich gas is investigated. Factors affecting SCWG of SBP were investigated by experimental design method. The variable parameters included temperature (385–460 °C), reaction time (10–30 min) and feedstock concentration (0.25–3.25 wt%). 460 °C, 30 min and 1.04 wt% were identified as optimal points for the highest hydrogen yield. SCWG of SBP and HDPE blend with different ratios were carried out to investigate the synergetic effect of blending on the efficiency of total gas and hydrogen yields. Hydrogen production increased with increasing the ratio of HDPE in the feedstock mixture and reached its maximum of 8.95 mmol/g at the ratio of 40 wt% and then started to decrease. Using a low-cost catalyst (Ni–Cu/AC-CaO) for SCWG of blended feedstock enhanced the total gas and hydrogen yields by factors of 2.4 and 3.8, respectively.
