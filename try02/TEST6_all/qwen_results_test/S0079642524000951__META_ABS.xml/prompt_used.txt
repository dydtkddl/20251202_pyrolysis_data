You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on fiber-reinforced polymer composites: Raw materials to applications, recycling, and waste management Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite has played a crucial role in replacing metals in numerous applications due to its superior properties and ease of manufacturing. Raw materials, design flexibility, microstructure, durability, and advanced fabrication techniques have further diversified its applications. However, consumption of a huge amount of synthetic polymeric materials and fibers in FRP composites poses a serious challenge to recycling and waste management. Most of the high-performance FRP composites are based on thermoset polymeric materials, which are non-recyclable. Therefore, fundamental research has been initiated on recycling of thermoset-based FRP composites. This review provides a comprehensive study of raw materials used for FRP composites and their applications and waste management, along with a future perspective. The review provides an insight into the chemistry of raw materials and techniques of their synthesis and extraction, fabrication, interface chemistry, structural analysis, and microstructural characterizations of FRP composites. It also focusses on the recent progress of FRP composites as an alternative to metals for various applications and the challenges faced. In addition, the review offers a special emphasis on Vitrimers, waste management, and biodegradation of FRP composites. Finally, the role of FRP composites for hydrogen storage and other futuristic applications is critically discussed.
