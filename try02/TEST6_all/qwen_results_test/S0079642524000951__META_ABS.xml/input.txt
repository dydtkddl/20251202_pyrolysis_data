A comprehensive review on fiber-reinforced polymer composites: Raw materials to applications, recycling, and waste management Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite has played a crucial role in replacing metals in numerous applications due to its superior properties and ease of manufacturing. Raw materials, design flexibility, microstructure, durability, and advanced fabrication techniques have further diversified its applications. However, consumption of a huge amount of synthetic polymeric materials and fibers in FRP composites poses a serious challenge to recycling and waste management. Most of the high-performance FRP composites are based on thermoset polymeric materials, which are non-recyclable. Therefore, fundamental research has been initiated on recycling of thermoset-based FRP composites. This review provides a comprehensive study of raw materials used for FRP composites and their applications and waste management, along with a future perspective. The review provides an insight into the chemistry of raw materials and techniques of their synthesis and extraction, fabrication, interface chemistry, structural analysis, and microstructural characterizations of FRP composites. It also focusses on the recent progress of FRP composites as an alternative to metals for various applications and the challenges faced. In addition, the review offers a special emphasis on Vitrimers, waste management, and biodegradation of FRP composites. Finally, the role of FRP composites for hydrogen storage and other futuristic applications is critically discussed.
