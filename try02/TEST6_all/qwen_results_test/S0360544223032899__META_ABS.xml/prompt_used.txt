You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Eulerian CFD simulation of biomass thermal conversion in an indirect slow pyrolysis rotary kiln unit to produce biochar from recycled waste wood Producing energy and higher value bio-products from waste wood recycled from construction and demolition (C&D) debris has been proposed as an economically viable opportunity in the biomass and bioenergy sectors. However, several challenges associated with the thermal conversion processes remain to be solved. This study introduces a 3D numerical simulation to study thermal conversion of wood chips. Combined biomass combustor, and indirect pyrolysis unit is used to create a self-sustainable biomass unit which does not rely on fossil fuel. Multizone heat distribution in the rotary kiln unit is investigated by employing CFD, an analytical algorithm and measurement tools in different zones of the equipment. A multizone heat transfer concept, the overall yield rate of biochar, thermochemical conversion of the bed, the volume shrinkage in the wood chips during the pyrolysis process, as well as biomass volatile and tar composition, and finally the potential of energy savings is widely investigated. CFD results and experimental evidence confirm that at least 31 % energy saving in drying zone can be achievable if drying and pyrolysis zone are separated in the indirect slow pyrolysis rotary kiln unit. The quality of biochar improved by 21 % increase in fixed carbon content and tar condensation is controlled.
