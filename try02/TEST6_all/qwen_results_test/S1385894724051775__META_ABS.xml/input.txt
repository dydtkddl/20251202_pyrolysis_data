Mass-producible γ-Al2O3/CaCO3 core–shell thermochemical energy storage particles by fluidized bed spray granulation Calcium-based thermochemical energy storage (TCES) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies for high-temperature concentrated solar power systems, where the mass production of energy storage particles is critical. In this study, we fabricated particles in layer granulation mode by fluidized bed spray coating method, with a production of ∼500 g of millimeter-sized core–shell particles in each batch, which is a scalable method. The suspension, consisting of CaCO3 and different dopants (Al2O3, SiC, or MnO2), is wet mixed prior, sprayed and coated onto fluidized γ-Al2O3 seed particles and then dried, producing γ-Al2O3/CaCO3 core–shell particles. The effects of doping materials and contents on the energy storage performance are conducted in fixed beds under calcination/carbonation cycle reactions. Compared to undoped particles, 10 % MnO2-doped samples increase the CO2 adsorption efficiency by 53.17 % after 20 cycles, while dopants of Al2O3 and SiC are more effective to decrease the mass loss after cyclic reactions. Finally, a binary doping of 6 % MnO2 and 4 % Al2O3 is conducted, showing further optimized adsorption performance, cyclic stability, and breakage resistance, whose energy storage density is 1407 kJ/kg after 45 cycles under fixed-bed reactions. Therefore, fluidized bed spray granulation is a potential method for mass production of TCES materials.
