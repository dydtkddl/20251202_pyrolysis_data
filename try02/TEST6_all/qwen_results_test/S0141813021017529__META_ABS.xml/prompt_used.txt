You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cellulose nanocrystals-filled poly (vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites as waterborne coating materials of NPK fertilizer with slow release and water retention properties Effective fertilizers management is essential for sustainable agricultural practices. One way to improve agronomic practices is by using slow-release fertilizers (SRF) that have shown interesting role in optimizing nutrients availability for plants growth. Considering the current ecological concerns, coated SRF using ecofriendly materials continue to attract great attention. In this context, novel waterborne and biodegradable coating nanocomposite formulations were elaborated from cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)-filled poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for slow release NPK fertilizer with water retention property. CNC were extracted from hemp stalks using sulfuric acid hydrolysis process and their physico-chemical characteristics were investigated. CNC with various weight loadings (6, 10, 14.5 wt%) were incorporated into PVA polymer via solvent mixing method to produce viscous coating nanocomposite formulations with moderated shear viscosity. Uniform PVA@CNC coating microlayer was applied on the surface of NPK fertilizer granules in Wurster chamber of a fluidized bed dryer at controlled spraying and drying parameters. The nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium release profiles from coated NPK fertilizer were determined in water and soil. It was found that the coating materials extended the N-P-K nutrients release time from 3 days for uncoated fertilizer to 10 and 30 days for neat PVA- and CNC/PVA-coated fertilizer in soil medium, indicating the positive role of the presence of CNC in the PVA-based coatings. The morphology, coating rate and crushing strength of the as-prepared coated products were investigated in addition to their effect on water holding capacity and water retention of the soil. Enhanced crushing strength and water retention with a positive effect on the soil moisture were observed after coating NPK fertilizer, mainly with high CNC content (14.5 wt%). Therefore, these proposed nanocomposite coating materials showed a great potential for producing a new class of SRF with high nutrients use efficiency and water retention capacity, which could be beneficial to sustainable crop production.
