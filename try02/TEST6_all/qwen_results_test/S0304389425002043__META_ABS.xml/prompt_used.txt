You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantification of micro- and nano-plastics in atmospheric fine particles by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with chromatographic peak reconstruction The effects of micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) on human health are of global concern because MNPs are ubiquitous, persistent, and potentially toxic, particularly when bound to atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5). Traditional quantitative analysis of MNPs by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) is often inaccurate because of false positive signals caused by similar polymers and organic compounds. In this study, a reliable analytical strategy combining HNO3 digestion and chromatographic peak reconstruction was developed to improve the precision of pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of multiple MNPs bound to PM2.5. The optimized HNO3 digestion method using high-pressure oxidation conditions effectively removed organic matter within two hours, giving recovery rates of 64 %–110 % for eight target MNPs. The chromatographic peak reconstruction procedure minimized interferences caused by similar polymers and achieved high accuracy (101 % ± 10 %) for polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene, whose concentrations are often overestimated due to overlapping pyrolysis products. Quantification uncertainties for MNPs in real PM2.5 samples were up to 52 % lower using the new method than using previous methods. The method was validated using PM2.5 from urban Guangzhou. The total concentrations of the eight target MNPs in the PM2.5 samples were 100–990 ng/m3 (median 277 ng/m3) and the dominant MNPs were polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl chloride, which contributed > 90 % of the MNPs. The new method allows the robust and accurate quantification of MNPs in atmospheric fine particles and will be useful in future studies on the environmental behaviors of MNPs and risks they pose.
