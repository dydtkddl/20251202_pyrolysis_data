Catalytic cracking of polyethylene over nanocrystalline HZSM-5: Catalyst deactivation and regeneration study In this work, catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) over nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite in a batch reactor at 340°C was carried out with the aim of study both the catalyst resistance to deactivation and the catalyst regeneration process. For looking into the catalyst deactivation, consecutive polyethylene cracking experiments were carried out. Subsequently, the same reactions has been also performed but by regenerating the zeolite after each experiment by promoting coke combustion at 550°C under air flow. Zeolites used were two samples of nanocrystalline HZSM-5 with very different textural properties (sample A, with most of its surface corresponding to zeolitic micropores and sample B with a considerable amount of external surface, mesopores and super-micropores) in order to study the effect of their textural properties in the deactivation and regeneration experiments. Although conversion and activity values reached over both samples are quite high taking into account the mild conditions used, sample B shows a very much higher initial activity than A due to its improved textural properties. In both samples two different deactivation mechanisms occur: a reversible deactivation by coke deposition removable by the regeneration procedure, and an irreversible or permanent deactivation by other factors. Deactivation of sample B occurs faster due to the higher amount of coke deposited on this material. However, the improved textural properties of this catalyst supposes an advantage for the regeneration process, since coke deposited either on the external surface or on the super-micropores and mesopores, makes easier the regeneration procedure.
