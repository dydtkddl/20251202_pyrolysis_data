You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the pyrolysis law of tires in a molten salt heating pyrolysis reactor: Experimental and CFD-DEM simulation Tire pyrolysis is an important method for the resource utilization of waste tires, and the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the reactor significantly affect the quality of the pyrolysis products. Current studies mainly focus on using air as the heat transfer medium for tire pyrolysis reactors. However, molten salt has better energy storage and heat transfer properties compared to air, yet research on using molten salt as a heat transfer medium for tire pyrolysis is still lacking. In this study, molten salt is innovatively used as the heat transfer medium, and the pyrolysis characteristics of tires are investigated based on a molten salt-heated tire pyrolysis reactor. A corresponding CFD-DEM method is developed to study the heat and mass transfer characteristics of tire particles during the pyrolysis process within the reactor. The results indicate that the proportion of single-ring aromatics in the pyrolysis oil exceeds 30%. The simulation results show that at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, the average heating rate of the tire particles is approximately 0.4–0.6 K/s during the first 100 s. As the pyrolysis reaction progresses, the heating rate of the tire particles gradually decreases, and then starts to increase to 0.41 K/s after 400 s.
