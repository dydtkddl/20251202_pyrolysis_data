You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cassava's harvest residue biochar from rotary kiln pyrolysis: Effects on sandy loam soil properties and maize growth Cassava shoot system (CSS) biomass is a smart and despised raw material for biochar production. Commonly, cassava roots and their husk are most exploited as feedstock for the thermoconversion process. In this research, we proposed the production of biochar from CSS in a continuous pyrolysis reactor at temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C, searching for added value to this agricultural residue and to produce a soil amendment material with good water retention potential. CSS-biochars have their effects tested on sandy loam soil at 25- and 50-ton ha−1 application rates. Considering soil amendment and carbon sequestration purposes of biochars, the volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash content are important parameters to be considered. Higher temperature produces more stable and less organic functionalized biochars, measured by the O/C values from 0.21 to 0.03 and H/C from 0.96 to 0.46. Biochars’ pH increases directly with the ash content and significantly alters the soil pH, increasing it from 5.0 to 6.0 with BC500C and BC600C at a rate of 50 tons ha−1. At the same application rate, BC400C and BC600C presented an increase in water-holding capacity of 13 % and 20 % compared with the control sample, respectively. Overall, the matric potential view for all application rates only the CSS-biochar produced at 600 °C demonstrated superior water retention compared to the reference control. An important observed aspect is the no significant impact of biochar on the maize germination step in pot experiments.
