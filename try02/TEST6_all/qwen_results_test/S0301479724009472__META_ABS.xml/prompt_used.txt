You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastic waste management through liquefaction in hydrogen donating solvents: A review Plastic pollution poses a significant environmental threat, particularly to marine ecosystems, as conventional plastics persist without degradation, accumulating plastic waste in landfills and natural environments. A promising alternative to address this issue involves the use of hydrogen donor solvents in plastic liquefaction, offering a dual benefit of waste reduction and the generation of valuable liquid products with diverse industrial applications. This review delves into plastic recycling methods with a specific focus on liquefaction using hydrogen donating solvents as an innovative approach to waste management. Liquefaction, conducted at moderate to high temperatures (280–450 °C) and pressures (7–30 MPa), yields high oil conversion using various solvents. This study examined the performance of hydrogen-donating solvents, including water, alcohols, decalin, and cyclohexane, in enhancing the oil yield while minimising the oxygen content. Supercritical water, recognised for its effective plastic degradation and chemical production capabilities, and alcohols, with their alkylating and hydrogen-donating properties, have emerged as key solvents in plastic liquefaction. The use of hydrogen donor solvents stabilizes the free radicals, enhancing the conversion of plastic waste into valuable products. In addition, this review addresses the economic efficiency of the liquefaction process.
