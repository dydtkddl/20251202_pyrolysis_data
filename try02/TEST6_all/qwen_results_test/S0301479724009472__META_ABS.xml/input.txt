Plastic waste management through liquefaction in hydrogen donating solvents: A review Plastic pollution poses a significant environmental threat, particularly to marine ecosystems, as conventional plastics persist without degradation, accumulating plastic waste in landfills and natural environments. A promising alternative to address this issue involves the use of hydrogen donor solvents in plastic liquefaction, offering a dual benefit of waste reduction and the generation of valuable liquid products with diverse industrial applications. This review delves into plastic recycling methods with a specific focus on liquefaction using hydrogen donating solvents as an innovative approach to waste management. Liquefaction, conducted at moderate to high temperatures (280–450 °C) and pressures (7–30 MPa), yields high oil conversion using various solvents. This study examined the performance of hydrogen-donating solvents, including water, alcohols, decalin, and cyclohexane, in enhancing the oil yield while minimising the oxygen content. Supercritical water, recognised for its effective plastic degradation and chemical production capabilities, and alcohols, with their alkylating and hydrogen-donating properties, have emerged as key solvents in plastic liquefaction. The use of hydrogen donor solvents stabilizes the free radicals, enhancing the conversion of plastic waste into valuable products. In addition, this review addresses the economic efficiency of the liquefaction process.
