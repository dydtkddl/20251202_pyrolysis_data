You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of lignin for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons: Effect of magnesium oxide catalyst A base catalyst is expected to suppress coke formation of the catalyst, leading to less catalyst deactivation and more efficient production of bio-oil. To examine the feasibility of a solid-base catalyst as a lignin pyrolysis catalyst, MgO loaded on supports with different textural, acid, and base properties (i.e. carbon, Al2O3, and ZrO2) was applied. In addition, because the co-processing of biomass with plastic significantly improves the quality of bio-oil in the catalytic pyrolysis process, co-pyrolysis of lignin with linear low-density polyethylene was performed, and the effects of the MgO catalysts were analyzed. Thermogravimetric analysis and a tandem micro-reactor–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system were used to evaluate the performance of the MgO catalysts in terms of thermal decomposition behavior and yield of monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Overall, MgO supported on carbon (MgO/C) showed the highest yield of aromatic hydrocarbons during the pyrolysis of lignin, due to its well-balanced acid/base sites and high surface area. Also, MgO/C exhibited the strongest positive synergy toward the production of aromatic hydrocarbons during co-pyrolysis, which suggests that a metal oxide with base properties supported on high-surface-area carbon could be an efficient catalyst for producing bio-oil with high energy density fuel additives from the lignin.
