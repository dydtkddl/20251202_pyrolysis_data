You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gas-phase origin of microwave methane pyrolysis carbon films Carbon films produced from microwave-based methane pyrolysis are complex mixtures of different carbon microstructures, making them challenging to characterize and control in order to enhance hydrogen production. In this paper, a combination of thermal oxidation, scanning electron microscopy and ultra-high temperature heat treatment approaches are used to expose the underlying microstructures present in carbon films formed from microwave-based methane pyrolysis. An oxidative stability similar to that of soot, along with a spherical microstructure suggests a gas-phase origin of the film. Ultra-high thermal treatment (2800–3000 °C) confirms the concentric arrangement of soot as it forms hollow shell-like structures upon heating and partial oxidation. Additionally, facetted structures are observed during the thermally pulsed graphite furnace treated samples. Raman spectra suggest these structures arise from small, layered regions with lower disorder but without any highly graphitic Bernal structure. These results, along with recent work on pyrolytic carbon and soot formation might also suggest a liquid-like crosslinked aromatic polymer is present as a reactive intermediate and could help to improve methane pyrolysis reactor designs.
