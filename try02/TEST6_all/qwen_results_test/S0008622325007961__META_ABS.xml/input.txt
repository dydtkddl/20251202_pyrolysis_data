Gas-phase origin of microwave methane pyrolysis carbon films Carbon films produced from microwave-based methane pyrolysis are complex mixtures of different carbon microstructures, making them challenging to characterize and control in order to enhance hydrogen production. In this paper, a combination of thermal oxidation, scanning electron microscopy and ultra-high temperature heat treatment approaches are used to expose the underlying microstructures present in carbon films formed from microwave-based methane pyrolysis. An oxidative stability similar to that of soot, along with a spherical microstructure suggests a gas-phase origin of the film. Ultra-high thermal treatment (2800–3000 °C) confirms the concentric arrangement of soot as it forms hollow shell-like structures upon heating and partial oxidation. Additionally, facetted structures are observed during the thermally pulsed graphite furnace treated samples. Raman spectra suggest these structures arise from small, layered regions with lower disorder but without any highly graphitic Bernal structure. These results, along with recent work on pyrolytic carbon and soot formation might also suggest a liquid-like crosslinked aromatic polymer is present as a reactive intermediate and could help to improve methane pyrolysis reactor designs.
