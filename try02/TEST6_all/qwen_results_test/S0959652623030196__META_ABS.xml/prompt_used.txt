You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocracking of polyethylene to hydrocarbon fuels over Pt/USY catalysts: Assessment of the hydrogen donors Hydrocracking is an effective approach to convert waste polyolefins into value-added fuels. Efficient hydrogen transfer from the hydrogen donors to the polyolefins is crucial to the hydrocracking process. In this work, we evaluated the hydrocracking effectiveness of different hydrogen donors (H2, tetralin and H2+tetralin) in polyethylene hydrocracking over a Pt/USY catalyst by analyzing and comparing the product distribution under varied H circumstances. The hydrocracking pathway using gaseous (H2) and liquidous (tetralin) hydrogen donors was proposed. The results show that the most effective H-donor for fuel oil production is H2, which yielded 65.8% oil abundant in C6–C12 range after reaction at 350 °C for 60 min. Tetralin can be dehydrogenated by Pt/USY catalyst to provide active H for PE hydrocracking, but the hydrocracking effectiveness is inferior to that using H2 because of catalyst deactivation caused by the by-products such as naphthalene from tetralin dehydrogenation. For the same reason, using H2+tetralin as H-donors is not as efficient for oil production as using sole H2 as H-donor. The reaction pathway of PE hydrocracking over Pt/USY catalyst using H2 and tetralin as the H-donor is different. Hydrocracking with H2 follows the hydrogenolysis pathway. When tetralin is presented, the hydrogenolysis pathway is cut off, followed by the thermal reactions between tetralin and PE, which inhibits PE cracking and decreases oil production.
