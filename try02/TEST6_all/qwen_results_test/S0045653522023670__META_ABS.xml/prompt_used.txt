You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous removal of multiple PFAS from contaminated groundwater around a fluorochemical facility by the periodically reversing electrocoagulation technique Increasing attentions have been paid on widespread contaminations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Particularly, simultaneous occurrence of multiple PFAS in the aquatic environments globally has been recognized as a crucial emerging issue. The present study aimed to perform simultaneous removal of multiple PFAS contaminations from groundwater around a fluorochemical facility based upon the technique of periodically reversing electrocoagulation (PREC). Accordingly, the experiments were implemented on the best conditions, actual application, and removal mechanism in the process of PREC with Al–Zn electrodes. Consequently, 1 mg/L synthetic solution of ten PFAS could be eliminated ideally during the initial 10 min, under the optimal conditions involving voltage at 12 V, pH at 7.0, and electrolyte with NaCl. The maximum removal rates of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were 90.9%, 91.0%, 99.7%, and 100%, respectively. The PREC performed a significant improvement for the wide scope of PFAS removal with the levels ranging from 10 μg/L to 100 mg/L. In addition, the optimized PREC technique was further applied to remove various PFAS contaminations from the natural groundwater samples underneath the fluorochemical facility, subsequently generating the removal efficiencies in the range between 31.3% and 99.9%, showing the observable advantages compared with other removal techniques for the actual application. Finally, the mechanism of PFAS removal was mainly related to enmeshment and synergistic bridging adsorption, together with oxidation degradation that determined by potential formation of short-chain PFAS in the PREC process. As a result, the PREC technique would be a promising technique for the efficient removal of multiple PFAS contaminations simultaneously from natural water bodies.
