Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling via steam gasification – The effect of operating conditions on gas and tar composition Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used in textile fiber, film, and bottles. Although PET bottle recycling has made great progress, other PET waste is still not recycled. Gasification could be an option for recycling or recovering energy and chemicals from PET waste. However, single stream PET steam gasification in fluidized bed is seldom investigated. In this paper, individual PET gasification experiments were then conducted in a lab-scale bubbling fluidized bed to investigate how gasifying agents, temperature, residence time and steam/fuel ratio affect the product composition. The results showed that, in steam gasification, steam was the main source of H2, but increasing the steam to fuel ratio cannot increase the H2 yield remarkably. Temperature was an essential parameter. Increasing temperature from 750 to 800 °C improved the yields of H2 (+87.7%), the dominant gas product CO2 (+40.3%), and biphenyl (+123%) notably. In contrast to other common thermoplastics, high concentrations of CO2 and biphenyl are the prominent characteristics of PET steam gasification. In addition, plastic steam gasification optimizations for syngas applications were discussed.
