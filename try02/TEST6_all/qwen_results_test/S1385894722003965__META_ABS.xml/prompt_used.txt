You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A scalable light-diffusing photochemical reactor for continuous processing of photoredox reactions In the last decade, photoredox catalysis has received a remarkable attention for its unique reactivity for synthesizing fine chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the coupled photon and heat generation of light sources create challenges for achieving a proper heat management of photochemical reactors, thus inhibiting large-scale applications. In this work, we proposed a strategy to decouple photon and heat using light guide plate (LGP) technology, and accordingly designed a continuous light-diffusing photochemical reactor (LDPR). In LDPR, the photons emitted from the edge light source are distributed uniformly on the top surface of LGP where the fluidic channels are located. This configuration isolates heat generation location from where photons are utilized, benefiting the heat management of the reaction zone. The photon flux of LDPR was characterized with a chemical actinometry method. Two important photocatalytic bond-forming reactions, α-amino arylation and C(sp2)–N cross-coupling, were demonstrated in LDPR with high efficiency. To show the scalability of LDPR, we increased the throughput via a hybrid strategy of scaling-up and scaling-out, achieving a continuous 10-gram synthesis of an α-amino arylation product.
