You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Role of neutral extractives and inherent active minerals in pyrolysis of agricultural crop residues and bio-oil formations The work reports a comparative study on the pyrolysis of five agricultural crop residues (peanut straw, cotton straw, sorghum stalk, corn stalk and reed) using a gas-sweeping fixed bed reactor. The study aims at clarifying the role played by the neutral extractives and inherent active minerals in the pyrolysis characteristics, product distributions and bio-oil compositions. Among five crop residues, reed showed the highest bio-oil yield but with the highest oxygen content and the lowest HHV (higher heat value), in relation to the least alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in it. Peanut straw had a content of neutral extractives as high as 47.4%, which contributed to the formations of a significantly higher proportion of long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and liquid nitrogenous compounds, distinct from four other crop residues. Peanut straw was also highly enriched with AAEMs, which was responsible for a strong catalytic activity for the selective deoxygenation of bio-oil. Neutral extractives in sorghum stalk and corn stalk formed some long chain fatty oxygenates and less nitrogenous compounds. The bio-oils derived from these two biomasses contained oxygenates as dominant compounds, however, they had a lower fraction of heavy constituents, lower oxygen contents, and higher HHVs than those of reed and cotton straw. This result was attributed to the catalyzed bio-oil deoxygenation by the relatively abundant AAEMs in sorghum stalk and corn stalk.
