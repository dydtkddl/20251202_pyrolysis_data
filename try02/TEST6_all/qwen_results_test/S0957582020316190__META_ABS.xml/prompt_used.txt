You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A bioassimilation and bioaccumulation model for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater using algae: New strategy A mathematical model for bioassimilation (BS) combined with bioaccumulation (BC) has been conducted to determine the removal and recovery of heavy metals (HMs) from wastewater using green algae. Response Surface and Box Benken Methodology (BBM) combined with best-fit simulation were used to determine ultimate uptakes. Results revealed that the percentages of HM removal (% RE r) and recovery (%HMc) are correlated with algal growth under the studied conditions. The developed mathematical model accurately predicts the % RE and HMc based on BS and BC mechanisms. Although the biosorption process exhibited higher metals uptakes than BS, the latter had a better affinity for the removal of different metals. The combined BS and BC mechanisms achieved 73 % and 69 % of Cu2+ and Pb2+removals, respectively, with the BC process is 6 folded higher than BS. Comparable percentage removal ∼ 74 % was observed for Cd2+, with 99 % of the removal was based on BC. The %HMc from aqueous and solid phases out of the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process was estimated at 56.5 %. Mathematical modeling of the combined BS with BC processes provides an efficient and robust tool for predicting and forecasting the performance of HMs removals and recovery via algae process.
