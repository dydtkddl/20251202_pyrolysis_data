You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and copyrolysis of three lignocellulosic biomass residues from the agro-food industry: A comparative study In this study, pyrolysis of residual biomass from the agro-alimentary industry of Argentina was investigated. The studied biomasses were rice husk, peanut shell and wheat straw. The effect of pyrolysis temperature over solid (bio-char), liquid (bio-oil) and gas (bio-gas) fractions weight yields were evaluated for each biomass, in the range of 350–650 °C. The maximum yield of bio-oil was obtained at 550 °C for rice husk (45 wt%) and wheat straw (58 wt%), and at 500 °C for peanut shells (51 wt%). At those temperatures, the data recorded the smallest spread around the mean. Different characterization techniques of raw biomass were reported, namely, thermal behavior; proximate and ultimate analysis; content of Ca, Al, K, Si and Fe; and hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin composition. Bio-oils characterization included water content and chemical compounds identification. Furthermore, bio-char HHV and BET surface area were measured. Rice husk bio-oil showed 21% selectivity towards furans of which 75% corresponded to furfural and 5-HMF. Peanut shell bio-char presented the highest Higher Heating Value (7250 kcal/kg) and BET surface area (215 m2/g). In addition, co-pyrolysis reactions and the synergistic effects over obtained products completed this study. Co-pyrolysis bio-oils yields varied between 41 and 46 wt%, for all the mixtures. Bio-oil water content decreased up to 15% for rice husk mixed with peanut shell or wheat straw. Moreover, 5-HMF was detected in all bio-oils, and furfural selectivity was higher than 5% in the three mixtures investigated.
