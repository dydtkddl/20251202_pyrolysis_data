You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-oil production from pyrolysis of oil palm biomass and the upgrading technologies: A review Oil palm biomass (OPB) represents major portion of the lignocellulosic waste in Malaysia that can be converted into bio-oil. This review aims to provide important insights in OPB-derived bio-oil production by first discussing the chemical compositions of different OPB and their effects to the bio-oil yield and quality obtained from pyrolysis process, followed by discussing the addition of plastics and catalysts into the pyrolysis for bio-oil upgrading, and lastly summarizing the existing technoeconomic and environmental studies and the potential use of process integration and intensification in this topic. Polypropene (PP), low density polyethylene (LDPE), and high density polyethylene (HDPE) have been commonly used in co-pyrolysis of OPB, which can effectively increase the heating value of bio-oil up to 80 % that of diesel. Likewise, acidic, basic, and neutral catalysts have been applied to increase the amount of hydrocarbon and phenol in the bio-oil, further improving the heating value to be comparable to diesel. The bio-oil production from OPB is currently still limited to demonstration scale despite the favorable environmental compatibility and technoeconomic feasibility shown by studies focused on empty fruit bunch (EFB). Several promising advanced pyrolysis processes that integrate other processes such as anaerobic digestion, hydrogen production process, and heat and power generation units as well as the advanced reactor designs are also overviewed here as future innovation of the bio-oil production from OPB, which may play more significant role as the technology matures.
