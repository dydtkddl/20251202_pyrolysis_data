You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the influence of Ru structures and supports on hydrogenolysis of polyethylene plastic waste The Ru dispersion of Ru/SBA-15 was controlled by varying the triethanolamine (TEA)/Ru molar ratios to examine the influence of Ru structures on the hydrogenolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) under moderate conditions (3 MPa hydrogen and 250 °C). Among the different Ru catalysts tested, Ru/SBA-15 with a TEA/Ru molar ratio of 10 (Ru/SBA-15 (10)) exhibited the best activity in LDPE hydrogenolysis. Analyses, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO chemisorption, CO Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and High-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed that the optimal amount of TEA (TEA/Ru = 10) increased the Ru dispersion (92%) and ultimately improved the catalytic activity of LDPE hydrogenolysis. The addition of TEA led to the formation of a [Ru(triethanolamine)2]3+ complex, which facilitated the introduction of Ru species into the confined space in SBA-15. The highly dispersed Ru species confined within SBA-15 in Ru/SBA-15 (10), along with the inherent properties of SBA-15, results in increased hydrogen coverage on the Ru species. This increase in hydrogen coverage leads to a higher liquid yield in LDPE hydrogenolysis compared to Ru/SiO2 (10). Additionally, we successfully employed Ru/SBA-15 (10) in the hydrogenolysis of postconsumer polyolefin waste, including commercial LDPE and LDPE bottles, producing valuable chemicals, such as liquid fuel and wax, in high yields of 65–70%.
