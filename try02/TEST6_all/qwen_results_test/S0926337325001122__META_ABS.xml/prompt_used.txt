You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improving hydrogen production via ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of non-thermal plasma pretreated HDPE with 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst Fast pyrolysis coupled with catalysis is a promising method for recycling waste plastic into value-added fuels, chemicals, and carbon materials. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was pretreated by non-thermal plasma (NTP) in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor where the discharge zone was packed with quartz glass beads, which enables the HDPE to present a low-degree of polymerization, high crystallinity, and rough surface morphology. The fast pyrolysis of pretreated HDPE significantly increased the content of C2–C4 light olefins in the pyrolysis vapors, notably the C2H4 content increasing by 19.78 % and 27.88 % after Ar and air NTP treatment, respectively. Compared with Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3, the novel 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst, which are characterized by a higher density of strong acid sites and superior ability to cleavage C−C and C−H bonds, possessed superior activity in upgrading of pyrolysis vapors, achieving a high H2 yield equivalent to 91.65 % hydrogen in HDPE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the C2H4 dissociation pathway prefers dehydrogenation followed by C−C bond cleavage and energetically favorable H2 evolution reaction (HER) rather than direct dissociation as indicated by lower dehydrogenation barriers on the surface of FeNi. This work provides a new insight for improving H2 yield in ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of HDPE.
