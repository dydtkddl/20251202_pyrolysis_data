You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combining Mo–Cu/HZSM-5 with a two-stage catalytic pyrolysis system for pine sawdust thermal conversion Mo–Cu/HZSM-5 catalysts for pine sawdust thermal conversion were prepared using an impregnation method. The Mo–Cu/HZSM-5 catalysts and HZSM-5 were characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All characterization results indicated that the introduction of CuO is beneficial to the dispersion of MoO3 in the HZSM-5. Combined with the two-stage catalytic pyrolysis system, the Mo–Cu/HZSM-5 catalysts were used for pine sawdust thermal conversion. The products included gas, bio-oil and bio-char. The gas was analyzed by Gas chromatography (GC). Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to identify the compounds in bio-oils. The water content, higher heating value (HHV) and viscosity of bio-oils were measured. The HHV and elements of bio-char were determined. The results indicated that Mo(3%)–Cu(3%)/HZSM-5 treatment yielded the highest amount of C6–C12 hydrocarbons, showed a robust ability to convert methane in the gas to bio-oil, and displayed no significant difference in the properties of bio-char when compared to different treatments in the same pyrolysis conditions.
