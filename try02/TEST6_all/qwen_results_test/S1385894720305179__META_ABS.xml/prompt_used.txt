You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Continuous aerosol photopolymerization to coat de-agglomerated nanoparticles A novel continuous aerosol photopolymerization technique to coat nanoparticles that have been previously de-agglomerated is presented. After de-agglomeration in a jet-impactor assisted fluidized bed, monomer vapors are condensed onto the surface of aerosolized nanoparticles via heterogeneous condensation. Photopolymerization is initiated through exposure to UV light. To demonstrate the process, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were selected as nanoparticle and organic monomer, respectively. We demonstrated this light-based technique, operated at ambient pressure and room temperature, is able to graft a PMMA-like film with a thickness of 1.5 nm on the surface of nanoparticles, confirmed by TEM and FTIR. XPS analysis confirmed formation of covalent bonds with the TiO2 surface, indicating a surface-initiated photopolymerization. Particle size measurements in suspension illustrated the efficiency of the de-agglomeration and subsequent coating process, as coated particles remained smaller than bare particles. UV–Vis absorbance spectra show that the coating facilitates dispersion in non-polar solvents. Finally, long-term stability experiment confirmed the suspension stability is enhanced not only because of the reduction of agglomerate sizes, but also as a result of the carbon coating that improves the interfacial interactions among particles, and between particles and solvent. This technique can be easily combined with any continuous inorganic nanoparticle generation process as a solvent-free post-synthesis approach to impart a functional coating.
