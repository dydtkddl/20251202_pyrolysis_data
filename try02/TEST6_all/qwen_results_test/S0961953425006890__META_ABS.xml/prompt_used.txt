You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquid hot water pretreatment technology: opening a new chapter in the green transformation and high-value utilization of biomass resources Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is a crucial technique for the generation of bioenergy and bioproducts. This approach demonstrates significant merits, including a 40 %–65 % elevation in lignocellulosic biomass conversion versus untreated substrates and a 30–50 % increase in glucose yield compared with dilute-acid pretreatment, thereby enhancing the economic viability of biorefineries. This article first explored the profound mechanisms during the LHW process. We also shed light on the structural alterations of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass undergoes during this process. Moreover, we survey the main applications of this pretreatment technology for the production of xylooligosaccharides, bioethanol, carbon quantum dots, etc. Finally, the key limitations of this technique were identified, notably inefficient energy utilization constituting sixty-two percent of total operating costs and inhibitor generation surpassing 1.2 g/L of phenolic compounds. Future research should prioritize innovations in reactor design (e.g., staged pressure systems) coupled with AI-driven optimization of temperature and pressure gradients. These advancements are anticipated to enhance process efficiency, reduce operational expenditures by 25 %–30 %, and facilitate effective by-product valorization. Future research imperatives should focus on technological advancements to concurrently enhance pretreatment efficacy, minimize operational expenditures, standardize biomass characteristics, and valorize secondary product streams. This necessitates strategic process intensification to ensure longitudinal operational feasibility and industrial scalability.
