Liquid hot water pretreatment technology: opening a new chapter in the green transformation and high-value utilization of biomass resources Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is a crucial technique for the generation of bioenergy and bioproducts. This approach demonstrates significant merits, including a 40 %–65 % elevation in lignocellulosic biomass conversion versus untreated substrates and a 30–50 % increase in glucose yield compared with dilute-acid pretreatment, thereby enhancing the economic viability of biorefineries. This article first explored the profound mechanisms during the LHW process. We also shed light on the structural alterations of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass undergoes during this process. Moreover, we survey the main applications of this pretreatment technology for the production of xylooligosaccharides, bioethanol, carbon quantum dots, etc. Finally, the key limitations of this technique were identified, notably inefficient energy utilization constituting sixty-two percent of total operating costs and inhibitor generation surpassing 1.2 g/L of phenolic compounds. Future research should prioritize innovations in reactor design (e.g., staged pressure systems) coupled with AI-driven optimization of temperature and pressure gradients. These advancements are anticipated to enhance process efficiency, reduce operational expenditures by 25 %–30 %, and facilitate effective by-product valorization. Future research imperatives should focus on technological advancements to concurrently enhance pretreatment efficacy, minimize operational expenditures, standardize biomass characteristics, and valorize secondary product streams. This necessitates strategic process intensification to ensure longitudinal operational feasibility and industrial scalability.
