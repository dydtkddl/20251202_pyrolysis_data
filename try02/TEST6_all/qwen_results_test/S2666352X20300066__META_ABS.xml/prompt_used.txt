You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On how mild oxidation affects the structure of carbons: Comparative analysis by different techniques Understanding how the structure of carbonaceous materials changes upon oxidation at mild temperature as a function of the graphitic order is of great importance for the development of clean combustion technologies, such as carbon fuel cells. The micro- and nanostructures of a range of carbon materials at room temperature and upon mild oxidation at 300 °C have been analysed by means of mercury porosimetry, Nitrogen adsorption, X-Ray Diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. The samples included carbons with increasing level of graphitic order: three chars derived from two bituminous coals and a lignite, a synthetic carbon and a graphitized coke. The experimental characterization allows to classify the materials according to different structural parameters, including porosity, surface area, degree of graphitization and paramagnetic activation of the carbonaceous surface. A correlation with the rank of the analysed materials is observed. For the graphitized coke, oxidation leads to more crystalline order and enhancement of the paramagnetic signal. A similar increase in the paramagnetic activity is observed for the Lignite char. On the other hand, for the higher rank, bituminous and synthetic chars, mild oxidation leads to a slight expansion of the amorphous carbon and loss of paramagnetic activity. The differences are rationalized in terms of formation of new carbon-oxygen complexes on the graphitized coke and on the Lignite char, and redistribution of already existing complexes for the higher-rank coals. This investigation complements previous X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.
