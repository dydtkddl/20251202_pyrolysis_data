You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste over NiO and HY for gasoline-range hydrocarbons production Recovering fuels or chemicals from plastic waste via pyrolysis is an innovative and promising route for both energy saving and refuse elimination. In this study, catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was performed to simultaneously improve yield and quality of gasoline-range products. NiO and HY zeolite were respectively used as in-situ and ex-situ catalysts in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis system. The results showed that the optimum pyrolysis and catalysis temperatures were 500 °C and 450 °C, respectively, with 56.53 wt% oil product and 93.80% gasoline-range fraction achieved. The content of high-octane-number compounds, primarily aromatics and isomerized aliphatics, increased from 23.5% to 80.4% as HY to LDPE ratio rose from 0 to 1:5. The optimized balance between oil yield and oil quality was obtained at the HY to LDPE ratio of 1:10. The presence of NiO during co-catalysis slightly decreased the oil yield by 5.3–8.5 wt%. Meanwhile, the production of aromatics was promoted obviously while the yield of normal aliphatics was inhibited, which were both favorable to improve the octane number of the oil product. The improved performance of co-catalysis could be related to the suitable hydrogen abstraction ability of NiO, which produced enormous alkenes. Subsequently, cycloalkenes and aromatics were synthesized through Diels-Alder reactions over the catalysis of HY. This co-catalysis approach in the microwave reactor provides a potentially profitable way to convert plastic waste into high-quality and high-yield gasoline fuels.
