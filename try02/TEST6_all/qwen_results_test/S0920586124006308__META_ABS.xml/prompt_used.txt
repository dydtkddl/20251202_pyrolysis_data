You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tetravalent metals modulated Zn-based layered double hydroxides and their mixed metal oxides for catalytic depolymerization of carbonyl-coordinating plastic waste Plastic waste generation has become a global issue and presents a significant challenge concerning degradability in the environment. This poses a serious threat and adverse impact on the health of living creature and the environment ecosystem. The up-/re-cycling of plastic waste through catalytic depolymerization is becoming a sustainable way to reduce economic concerns about production and serious environmental impacts. Here, in the present study an effort has been made for the development of catalysts for efficient recycling of carbonyl group containing polymer waste [Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC)]. The sequential preparation of ZnMIV- and ZnAlMIV- LDHs (layered double hydroxides) (MIV= Zr and Ti) and their respective mixed metal oxide (MMOs) based catalytic materials, has been carried out by one-pot co-precipitation and calcination methods. The structural parameters were examined through the various characterisation techniques including XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, and EDS. The layered structure, high crystalline nature and hexagonal 2D-sheet/flakes like morphology with average particle size ranging from ∼14–51 nm [for LDHs] and ∼6–21 nm [for MMOs] were observed. Depolymerization of PET and PC using LDHs/MMOs catalyst in ethylene glycols (EG) produced bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET) and bisphenol A (BPA) monomers as main products, respectively. The catalyst quantity, concentration of solvent, recyclability of catalysts, reaction duration, and crystallization time have also been further investigated for better yield during catalytic glycolysis. The isolated monomers were further characterized by using melting point, mass spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR analysis. The order of catalytic activities of prepared samples as ZnTi-LDH˃ ZnAlTi-LDH ˃ ZnTi-MMO˃ ZnAlZr-LDH˃ ZnAlTi-MMO˃ ZnZr-LDH in PET depolymerization while in case of PC, the order as ZnTi-LDH˃ ZnAlTi-LDH ˃ ZnZr-LDH˃ ZnAlZr-LDH˃ ZnZr-MMO˃ ZnAlZr-MMO˃ ZnTi-MMO˃ ZnAlTi-MMO were observed. LDH samples showed higher catalytic conversion than their respective MMOs during PET and PC depolymerization into monomers BHET and BPA with % yield of ∼76–83 % and ∼81–89 %, respectively. ZnTi-LDH shows high catalytic efficacy in depolymerization of PET and PC with yield of (∼82 %) BHET monomer and (89 %) BPA. This catalyst displayed good recyclability more than eight cycles during this catalytic glycolysis study.
