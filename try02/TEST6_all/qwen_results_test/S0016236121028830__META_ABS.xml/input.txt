Microwave-assisted pyrolysis for carbon catalyst, nanomaterials and biofuel production The current scenario of environment urgently needs alternative biologically synthesized fuels, value-added products, and preparation of catalyst to create a pollution free environment. Usually, several methods are available for the synthesis of various commodities from many biological resources. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) is a relatively new process and has emerged as a promising technique to transform biomass feedstock into biofuels, including bio-oil, syngas and biochar. This paper provides a state-of-art review on MAP of several wastes such as lignocellulosic biomass, waste oils, municipal solid waste and electronic waste, discussing on the biofuels produced (bio-oil, syngas and biochar) as well as the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers). The use of microwave adsorbent and catalyst in MAP process are reviewed, including utilization of biochar as one of the microwave absorbers. Life cycle analysis and scale-up process with the global view of MAP are presented to contribute to the further advancement and commercialization of this technology. Although there are several challenges to be resolved, MAP has a high energy efficiency and is an increasingly feasible technique to be scalable, economical and environmental friendly.
