You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fine-tuning hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite by controlled aggregation of protozeolitic units functionalized with tertiary amine-containing organosilane Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization of protozeolitic nanounits previously functionalized with two types of commercially available organosilanes. The first one (N,N-diethyl-3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, DEAMP) is a monopodal organosilane that contains a tertiary amine group, whereas the second one (1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)decane, BTMDC) includes a long aliphatic chain and two tri-alkoxysilyl groups (dipodal organosilane). The properties of the samples obtained have been compared with two nanocrystalline ZSM-5 materials as references. While both organosilanes are effective in generation of a secondary porosity, enhancing strongly the textural properties of ZSM-5 zeolite, DEAMP affords for more uniform nanounits in the aggregates with narrower mesopore size distribution compared to BTMDC. On the other hand, varying the concentration of DEAMP during the silanization step (in the range of 2.5–10 mol%, referred to the silica content of the synthesis gel) it has been possible to synthesize hierarchical ZSM-5 samples showing progressively smaller size of the nanounits in the aggregates. This fact has led to important changes in both the textural and acid properties of the zeolite samples. In particular, a decrease in the Brønsted/Lewis acid sites ratio has been observed with increasing the concentration of DEAMP introduced in the synthesis gel. These materials have been tested as catalysts for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) cracking, showing enhanced catalytic activity in comparison with the two reference nanocrystalline ZSM-5 samples. A maximum of the LDPE conversion has been obtained with the h-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared with 5 mol% of silanization agent as this material exhibits an optimum combination of acidic features and accessibility.
