Starch-based novel ingredients for low glycemic food formulation The demand for ultra-processed food products is directly related to people's rapidly changing habits and diet. This transition and the associated detrimental health issues have triggered global health authorities to raise the concern of increasing more fibre, physiologically functional foods, and ingredients into western diets. Human endogenous enzymes can readily digest ultra-processed starch-containing foods; hence, they are highly glycemic and associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the development of starch-based food ingredients with a low glycemic response is deemed necessary. Starch-derived ingredients, including: polydextrose (PD), resistant dextrins and maltodextrins (RMD), cyclodextrins (CD), Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) and resistant starch (RS), have been heavily investigated for their health benefits and various health claims were approved promoting their use in many food applications. These ingredients are either chemically (PD and RS-IV) or enzymatically produced (CD, RMD, and IMO). This review focuses on the various production processes of these novel ingredients, food applications, glycemic response roles, and a commercial overview of available brands. Enzymatically produced starch-ingredients proved functional, promoting their extensive future application since consumers prefer safely produced ingredients to be incorporated into their diet.
