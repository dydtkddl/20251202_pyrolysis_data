You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Starch-based novel ingredients for low glycemic food formulation The demand for ultra-processed food products is directly related to people's rapidly changing habits and diet. This transition and the associated detrimental health issues have triggered global health authorities to raise the concern of increasing more fibre, physiologically functional foods, and ingredients into western diets. Human endogenous enzymes can readily digest ultra-processed starch-containing foods; hence, they are highly glycemic and associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the development of starch-based food ingredients with a low glycemic response is deemed necessary. Starch-derived ingredients, including: polydextrose (PD), resistant dextrins and maltodextrins (RMD), cyclodextrins (CD), Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO) and resistant starch (RS), have been heavily investigated for their health benefits and various health claims were approved promoting their use in many food applications. These ingredients are either chemically (PD and RS-IV) or enzymatically produced (CD, RMD, and IMO). This review focuses on the various production processes of these novel ingredients, food applications, glycemic response roles, and a commercial overview of available brands. Enzymatically produced starch-ingredients proved functional, promoting their extensive future application since consumers prefer safely produced ingredients to be incorporated into their diet.
