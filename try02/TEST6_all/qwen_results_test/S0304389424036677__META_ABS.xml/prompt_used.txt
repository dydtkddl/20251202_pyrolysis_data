You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvent-free upcycling of agricultural plastic waste using in situ self-assembly metal nanoparticles co-doped microporous carbocatalyst for advanced transportation fuels Plastic mulching film is ubiquitous in modern agriculture for its heat preservation and moisture retention functions. However, plastic mulching film waste accumulated on land results in microplastic pollution, posing potential hazards as these micro and nanoplastics can enter the food chain. Chemical upcycling of waste mulching film is an emerging strategy to realize sustainable development and circular economy. This study explored an innovative decomposition-catalysis pathway over in situ self-assembly metal nanoparticles (NPs) co-doped microporous carbonaceous catalyst (M/PCCs) to upcycle waste mulching film. M/PCCs with varying Zn and Ni co-additions were tested and found that Zn50-Ni20/CSB1 (ZnCl2: 50 %; NiCl2: 20 %) predominantly favored the formation of liquid hydrocarbons and high-purity H2 production. Importantly, Zn-Ni co-doped on pine sawdust-derived carbon catalyst (Zn-Ni/PSB) with the highest surface area (671 m2/g) and microporosity (76.05 %) exhibited the highest liquid yield (51.67 wt%), and the extremely high carbon selectivity of 89.38 C% for gasoline and 71.98 C% for jet fuel, respectively. Additionally, Zn-Ni/PSB on the time stream was in situ 3D visually evaluated to insightfully unveil the catalytic deconstruction and catalyst deactivation mechanisms. In brief, this study presented a promising solution to effectively upcycle agricultural waste mulching film and thereby mitigate micro and nanoplastics pollution.
