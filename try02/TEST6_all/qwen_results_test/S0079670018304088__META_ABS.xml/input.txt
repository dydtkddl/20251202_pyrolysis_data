Recent progress in controlled carbonization of (waste) polymers The controlled carbonization of polymers is one of the most important polymer reactions. It represents the conversion process of polymeric precursors into carbonaceous materials in a “controlled” manner. In this review, we summarize the research progress on the controlled carbonization of (waste) polymers in preparing functional carbon materials with well-defined microstructures, fabricating advanced polymer composites with enhanced flame retardancy, and converting waste polymers into high value-added nanocarbon materials. The carbonization mechanisms of polymers with different compositions and chain structures are highlighted. How to match the degradation reaction of polymers with the carbonization reaction of the degradation products is addressed to improve the carbonization efficiency and optimize the growth of carbon materials. The applications of (waste) polymer-derived carbon materials in electrochemical energy storage and environmental remediation are reviewed. Current existing limitations and future perspectives are also given.
