You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards net zero emissions, recovered silicon from recycling PV waste panels for silicon carbide crystal production The high rate of PV adaptation around the world requires a strategy for recovery of the materials from PV waste panels and a circular market development. In particular, the silicon recovered from the PV cells can be used in different applications. A valuable acquisition is to refine the recovered silicon at metallurgical grade to a high level of purity namely electronic grade silicon which in conjunction with graphite can be the raw material for silicon carbide crystal production. Based on a comprehensive and critical review of the latest research and development of relevant technologies, a manufacturing process is proposed to increase the usage of renewable resources, reduce the energy consumption and CO2e emissions. The recovered silicon from recycling PV waste can reduce the CO2e emissions to a third of what is involved in the current carbothermic reduction of quartz in an induction furnace. Based upon the thorough evaluation of available evidence, a continuous coupled process is envisaged where the upgraded metallurgical grade silicon from recycling PV waste undergoes further vacuum and gas refining to the electronic grade silicon. Then the purified liquid silicon enters a vertical Bridgeman furnace for silicon carbide crystal production through a bottom seeded solution growth process. Considering the silicon melting point at 1410 °C, omitting a solidification/ meting step after vacuum/gas refining leads to energy and material saving. The continuous method can reduce the CO2e emissions up to 75% compared with the current silicon carbide production through Acheson process.
