You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improvement in BHETA yield by aminolysis and its application in hot melt adhesive Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling has been carried out by various methods, e.g., mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, and energy recovery method. In this study, chemical recycling of PET was carried out by aminolysis using ethanolamine and converted into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalamide (BHETA). We have studied the effective polymeric catalysis of the aminolytic depolymerization of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using sulfated polyborate producing a broad range of crystalline terephthalamides. The reaction was performed by varying the PET: ethanolamine ratio, reaction time and catalyst. Recycled PET bottles, film, and fibres were used for conversion. A yield of 95 % was obtained for PET: ethanolamine ratio of 1:4 (w/w), with 4 h reaction time, at 160 o C with sulfated polyborate as a catalyst. BHETA was characterized with FTIR, 1H,13C NMR, and DSC analysis. BHETA further gets reacted with dimer acid along with Ethylenediamine (EDA) at different molar ratios which produces polyesteramide (PEA) based hot melt adhesive (HMA). Thermal, mechanical, and rheological tests are performed and compared with traditional HMA. The effect on the properties of the hot melt adhesive, such as mechanical properties: tensile strength, shore D hardness, elongation at break; thermal properties: glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), the heat of crystallization (Hc), crystallization temperature (Tc); adhesion properties: lap shear strength (LSS) and T-peel strength (TPS); rheological properties and degree of crystallinity were investigated. It was observed that the mechanical and thermal properties are increased by optimizing the concentration of BHETA. These HMA materials may have the capacity of being eco-friendly and have high adhesion properties.
