Development of plasma pyrolysis/gasification systems for energy efficient and environmentally sound waste disposal As more efficient and reliable torches for thermal plasma generation have become available in recent years, the use of thermal plasma as an energy source for pyrolysis/gasification has attracted much interest, and special attention has been paid to waste treatment for resource and energy recovery. Plasma pyrolysis/gasification systems have unique features such as the extremely high reaction temperature and ultra-fast reaction velocity compared to traditional pyrolysis/gasification systems. Plasma pyrolysis/gasification is therefore acknowledged as a novel pyrolysis/gasification technology with great potential in solid waste disposal. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the development of fundamental researches on plasma pyrolysis/gasification systems including direct current (DC) arc plasma system and radio frequency (RF) plasma system with an emphasis on reactor design such as plasma fixed/moving bed reactor system, plasma entrained-flow bed reactor system and plasma spout-fluid bed reactor system.
