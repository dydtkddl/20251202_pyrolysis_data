You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient degradation of polystyrene microplastics in aquatic systems via plasma activated water: Mechanistic insights, life cycle assessment, and environmental safety evaluation Microplastics in aquatic systems demand treatments that are efficient, environmentally compatible, and scalable. An 81.8 % removal efficiency for PS-MPs was obtained in 2 h using PAW at an initial concentration of 1 g/L. In-situ EPR/chemical probes and OES establish an interfacial radical environment, while hybrid DFT—anchored to these measurements—identifies benzylic hydrogen abstraction by •OH, followed by peroxidation and β-scission, as the kinetically favored backbone-cleavage sequence. Finite-element field simulations resolve high-field hotspots at the needle apex and rationalize interfacial radical flux. Multiscale characterization (SEM, FTIR/UV–Vis, TOC, Mw) shows a staged evolution from surface roughening to oxidative chain scission and release of low-molecular-weight products confirmed by GC–MS. Time-resolved ecotoxicity indicates that extended treatment reduces acute responses and yields effluents with low toxicity to Chlorella vulgaris and Vigna radiata; some products are microbially utilizable. Life-cycle assessment shows a lower carbon footprint than photocatalysis and activated-carbon adsorption for an equivalent functional unit; techno-economic analysis indicates favorable cost trajectories with continuous-flow operation and renewable electricity. Together, these results establish an integrated reactor–molecule–system framework for plasma remediation and provide actionable levers (electrode geometry, gap/flow, energy supply) for translating PS-MP degradation to environmentally relevant conditions.
