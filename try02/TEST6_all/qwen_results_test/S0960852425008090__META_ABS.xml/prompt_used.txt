You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combustion reactivity of hydrothermally derived biochar from sugarcane green harvesting residues (GHR): An evaluation as a solid fuel This study presents a novel macro-scale non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis to evaluate the combustion reactivity of hydrochars derived from hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of sugarcane green harvesting residues (GHR). HTC was applied to enhance the fuel properties of GHR, a biomass with low mass and energy density and high alkaline and alkaline-earth metal content, assessing its viability as a partial replacement for bagasse and coal in industrial boilers. HTC was conducted in a batch reactor without agitation using a particle size of 0.25 mm. A central composite experimental design was employed to evaluate the effects of temperature (200–300 °C) and water/GHR mass ratio (5/1 to 10/1) on mass yield, higher heating value (HHV), and energy density. Reaction time was 30 min with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Raw GHR and hydrochars were characterized following ASTM standards. The highest dry mass yield (84.5 %) was obtained at 200 °C and a 5/1 ratio, while the maximum HHV (29.2 MJ/kg daf) and energy density (1.71) were achieved at 300 °C and a 10/1 ratio. HTC increased fixed carbon and reduced volatile matter due to dehydration, hydrolysis, depolymerization, oxidation, and carbonization. Through macro-scale non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis, hydrochar at 200 °C and water/GHR ratio of 10/1 exhibited the highest combustion index (5.15 × 10−1⁰ %2min−2°C−3) and mass yield (84.5 % db). Despite lower volatile matter, its activation energy (178.52 kJ/mol) remained comparable to raw GHR (116.25 kJ/mol), indicating no significant loss in reactivity. These findings highlight the potential of GHR-derived hydrochar as a sustainable alternative fuel for industrial applications.
