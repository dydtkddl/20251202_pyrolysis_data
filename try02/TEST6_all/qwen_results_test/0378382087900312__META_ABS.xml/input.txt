The influence of pyrolysis conditions on the reactivity of CHAR in H2O A German gas flame coal was used in a study of the effects of pyrolysis conditions on the reactivity of the subsequent chars (0.1 – 0.3 mm particle size) in steam. Most of the chars were prepared in inert gas atmospheres i.e. helium or argon under a variety of conditions of heating rate (3 K/min to 4000 K/s), temperature (500 to 900 °C), soak time (0.2 s to 4 h), and pressure (1 – 66 bar). Reactive gas atmospheres, steam and hydrogen were used as pyrolysis gases only for selected experiments. Proximate and ultimate analysis of the chars, total pore volumes and surface areas and the concentration of active sites of selected samples were determined. Pyrolysis conditions applied were found to have a marked influence on the char reactivity, thus a correlation between the treatment conditions and rates of reaction was sought.
