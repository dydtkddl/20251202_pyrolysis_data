Cooperative hydrogen evolution reaction combining Cu2+1O and Ru active sites The design and construction of electrocatalysts with multiple components to modulate the intrinsic catalytic activity is a compelling strategy to achieve Pt-like activity for hydrogen generation. Challenging on the inert Cu-based electrocatalysts for water reduction, herein, a novel and fruitful CuRu-based electrocatalysts (RuCuOx/NC) is established by combining dual-templates assembling and pyrolysis protocol with a subsequent hot-alkali corrosion. Benefitting from the synergetic effect of Cu2+1O (with copper excess defects) and Ru, the as-prepared RuCuOx/NC affords brilliant activity and stability under alkaline condition. In 1 M KOH, the RuCuOx/NC provides Pt-like activity with overpotential of ∼29 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2. Theoretical calculations certified that H2O dissociation was accelerated and hydrogen adsorption free energy was optimized by the cooperation of Cu2+1O and Ru. This work proposes a promising methodology to construct multi-components electrocatalysts, which may lend perspective for the design of advanced electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.
