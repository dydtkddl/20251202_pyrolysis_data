You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic analysis of thermal and catalytic degradation of polymers found in waste electric and electronic equipment Thermo-chemical recycling of plastics originating in waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) is always a challenge due to the production of secondary value-added compounds or energy from obsolete materials. The dominant step for a suitable design of any pyrolysis reactor is to understand the kinetics of thermal degradation of the input materials. Therefore, in this investigation thermal and catalytic degradation of several polymers found in WEEE, such as High-Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), polypropylene (PP), and polycarbonate (PC) as well as PC/MgO and PP/MCM-41 was investigated. The random scission model developed by Sanchez-Jimenez et al., with L = 2 was used for the simulation of the degradation of all systems at several heating rates. The activation energy was estimated using an isoconversional approach. A system of differential equations were set and solved using as an adjustable parameter only the pre-exponential factor. It was found that using the same set of parameters, thermogravimetric data at different heating rates can be simulated very well in the range 0.3 < α < 0.9. This observation verified the hypothesis that at this region of degradation the dominant mechanism is that of random scission. Better simulation was obtained at higher heating rates. Using catalysts of variable acidity, it was verified that the activation energy of the catalytic was decreased compared to the conventional thermal degradation.
