You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing pyrolysis and Co-Pyrolysis of plastic and biomass using Artificial Intelligence The rapid increase in biomass and plastic waste poses significant environmental challenges. Co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic wastes offers a promising avenue for sustainable waste management and renewable energy generation. This study covers several novel aspects: First, it investigates the impacts of feedstock composition and operating conditions in pyrolysis (individual feedstock) and co-pyrolysis (biomass and plastic wastes). The study reveals that synergistic effects, specifically improved yields and optimized temperature, exist in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes compared to individual feedstock. Secondly, a suitable blended machine learning predictive model (with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost) and robust optimization framework are developed to address model accuracy, non-linear interactions, and uncertainties in pyrolysis such as temperature, heating rate, and biomass-to-plastic ratio. This study predicts the bio-oil yield quantitatively (amount) and qualitatively (composition) with high accuracy (R2 > 0.97). Thirdly, key factors contributing to yield include plastic content (18 %) and biomass type (13 %) have been identified through Gini feature importance and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) analysis. Furthermore, multi-objective optimization techniques reveal the most optimal bio-oil yield under specific conditions, supported by uncertainty analysis, which confines bio-oil yield to a range of 30–50 %. Finally, it also demonstrates a case study to find the optimal bio-oil yield and quality conditions using co-pyrolysis of local resources, i.e., biomass (wood and bagasse) and plastic wastes. The case study suggests optimal conditions like > 50 °C heating rate, 60 % plastic content in a blend of wood and HDPE. This study assists industries and policymakers to assess and understand the viability of co-pyrolysis, optimal design parameters, and process impacts.
