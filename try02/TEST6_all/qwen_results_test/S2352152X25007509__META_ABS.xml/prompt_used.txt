You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass-derived graphitic-like hierarchical porous carbon for electrochemical supercapacitor application High conductivity and applicable pore size are typically anticipated as key features for high-performance capacitive carbon electrodes in supercapacitor applications. However, these desired characteristics often conflict with each other, making incorporating both into a single carbon material challenging. Herein, graphitic-like hierarchical porous carbon (GHPC) was synthesized through a straightforward two-step pyrolysis process, utilizing pumpkin skin as the precursor without activating agents. We found that in contrast, to single pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere, further annealing under H2 gas effectively improves specific surface area and creates a graphitic-like hierarchical porous structure with mesopores, achieving an effective electrode potential for supercapacitors. GHPC's unique graphitic-like hierarchical porous structure contributes to excellent electrochemical performance achieving a specific capacitance of 274 Fg−1 and exceptional rate capability of 67 % at 1 Ag−1. Furthermore, GHPC showcased an outstanding cyclic stability of 95.7 % at current density of 2 Ag−1 after 5000 cycles in 1 M KOH analyte, comparable to the state-of-the-art chemically activated biomass-derived carbon. These results emphasize the potential of biomass-derived graphitic-like hierarchical porous carbon as a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
