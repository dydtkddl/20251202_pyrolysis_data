You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of the third generation of bioceramics: Doping hydroxyapatite with s-, p-, d-, and f-blocks cations and their potential applications in bone regeneration and void filling The bioceramic market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 7% within 2022–2027. In this regard, hydroxyapatite (HA) is highly recommended as a leading material for the development of the third generation of bioceramics due to its intrinsic osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and osteogenesis properties. However, the use of synthetic HA is currently limited due to the unfavourable mechanical and morphological issues on cell infiltration and interaction. To overcome these obstacles, various strategies have been proposed, especially through a wide range of cationic and anionic doping. Among them, cationic doping seems to have a set of significant benefits over pure HA due to the significant microstructural modifications, and thus this strategy represents a major step forward in improving the inherent drawback of bioceramic implants, i.e., their poor mechanical properties. Accordingly, this review aims to highlight candidates with potential for further clinical development of the third-generation bioceramics through doping HA with s-, p-, d-, and f-blocks cations and to explore their potential applications in bone regeneration and void filling. We first introduce the concept of bone grafting and its classifications, and then we discuss bioceramic-based bone grafting materials. Subsequently, mono-, dual-, and multi-cationic substitutions in HA and their performances, especially in biomedical applications, are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of ionic substitution in HA, particularly in lanthanoids- and actinoids-containing HA-based ceramics are proposed.
