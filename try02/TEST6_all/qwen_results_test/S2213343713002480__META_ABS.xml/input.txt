Optimization of process parameters by response surface methodology (RSM) for catalytic pyrolysis of waste high-density polyethylene to liquid fuel Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process for catalytic pyrolysis of waste high-density polyethylene to liquid fuel over modified catalyst. The reaction temperature, acidity of the modified catalysts and mass ratio between modified catalysts to waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were chosen as independent variables. Face centered central composite (FCCD) design of experiment has been used. Optimum operating conditions of reaction temperature (450°C), acidity of catalyst (0.341) and catalyst to waste HDPE ratio (1:4) were produced the maximum liquid product yield of 78.7%. The quadratic model obtained fits well to predict the response with a high determination coefficient of R 2 (0.995). The liquid fuel obtained by catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE at optimized condition consists of petroleum products range hydrocarbons (C10–C25) with high heating value (40.17MJ/kg).
