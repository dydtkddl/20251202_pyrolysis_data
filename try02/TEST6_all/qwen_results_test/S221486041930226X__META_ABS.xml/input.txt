A review of mechanical properties of additively manufactured Inconel 718 Inconel 718 is one of the most commonly employed alloys for metal additive manufacturing (MAM) and has a wide range of applications in aircraft, gas turbines, turbocharger rotors, and a variety of other corrosive and structural applications involving temperatures of up to ∼700 °C. Numerous studies have investigated different aspects of the mechanical behaviour of additively manufactured (AM) Inconel 718. This study analyses the observations from more than 170 publications to provide an unbiased engineering overview for the mechanical response of AM Inconel 718 (and its variations and spread among different reports). First, a brief review of the microstructural features of AM Inconel 718 is presented. This is followed by a comprehensive summary of tensile strength, hardness, fatigue strength, and high-temperature creep behaviour of AM Inconel 718 for different types of MAM techniques and for different process and post-process conditions.
