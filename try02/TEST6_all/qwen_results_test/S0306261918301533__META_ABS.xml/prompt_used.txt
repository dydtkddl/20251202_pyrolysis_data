You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on model compound of biomass gasification tar cracking in microwave furnace: Comparative research Tar is a major concern for advancing biomass gasification in industrial application due to its risk to downstream pipes/equipment and tar-contaminated environmental issue. Meanwhile, tar also leads to energy loss. Thermal cracking with or without catalyst is a widely used method for removing tar during biomass gasification. Microwave thermal cracking is a lately developed method of removing tar and only a few literatures are available on its reaction parameters and catalytic effect. A microwave tube furnace was designed for investigating tar cracking in our lab. Toluene as biomass tar model compound was cracked under various operating conditions assisted by three different bed materials (SiC, biochar, and biochar-Ni). The results showed that microwave heating is effective for toluene cracking, and biochar can act as a bi-functional catalyst for toluene cracking. Toluene cracking rate reached 95.12% under reaction temperature of 800 °C, catalyst particle size of 40–60 meshes and Ni loading of 4 wt%. Hydrogen concentration was higher than 92 vol%. The mechanism of toluene cracking, effect of microwave and efficiency of energy conversion were also carefully discussed, and the applied potential of microwave tar cracking technology was proved.
