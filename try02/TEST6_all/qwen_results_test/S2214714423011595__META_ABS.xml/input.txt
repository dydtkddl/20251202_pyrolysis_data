Cobalt oxide/polypyrrole derived Co/NC to activate peroxymonosulfate for benzothiazole degradation: Enhanced conversion efficiency of PMS to free radicals Loading metal on N-doped C material is an effective way of improving the activation efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts for persulfate. Many studies have explored the intrinsic relationship between material modification and enhanced activation efficiency from various aspects. In this study, a cobalt oxide/polypyrrole (Co3O4/PPy) derived Co/NC composite catalyst has been synthesized and used for the activation of PMS. The mechanism study showed that Co/NC can enhance the oxidation efficiency of the reaction system by improving the conversion efficiency of PMS to free radicals. Furthermore, the mechanism of the effect of physicochemical properties of Co/NC (electron transfer capacity, functional bonds, structural texture, etc.) on the conversion of PMS to free radical was explored by regulating the ratio of PPy and metal Co. This study can provide a new catalyst synthesis strategy for the efficient formation of free radicals in heterogeneous persulfate activated systems.
