You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling and optimization of flash heating process conditions for activated carbon production using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Activated carbon, a versatile material with wide-ranging applications, faces challenges in traditional production methods, particularly in slow heating processes. This study addresses these challenges by proposing an alternative approach—flash heating. Building upon insights from prior studies, this study shifts the focus towards modeling and optimizing flash heating conditions using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) to establish an in-depth understanding of key variables, aiming to improve production efficiency and activated carbon characteristics. A full 23 factorial design was used to investigate the effects of activation temperature, activation time, and impregnation ratio on flash heated activated carbon production. Under optimum conditions maximum surface area of activated carbon was determined as 1278.2 m2/g at 850 °C final activation temperature applying 10 min activation time using 2:1 KOH: biomass wt/wt impregnation ratio. The difference between the experimental and predicted values at the optimum conditions showed that the model was effective for studying the influence of the process parameters on the chemically activated carbon production. The proposed methodology has the potential to revolutionize activated carbon production, offering a more sustainable, cost-effective, and industrially feasible solution with broader applications in environmental remediation and industrial processes.
