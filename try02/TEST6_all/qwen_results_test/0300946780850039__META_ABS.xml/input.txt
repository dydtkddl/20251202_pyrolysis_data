Steady-state behavior of gas—liquid—solid fluidized-bed reactors A model for a three-phase fluidized-bed reactor is presented. In industrial processes such as hydrocracking, coal liquefaction, etc., gas absorption, gas desorption and reactions in the liquid phase occur simultaneously and competitively. In processes such as these, the desorbed gases (mainly lighter hydrocarbons) usually have much higher molecular weights than the gas being absorbed (usually hydrogen). This results in significant loss of the original liquid owing to formation of volatile products (vaporization is insignificant at low temperatures but nearly 100% vaporization may result at high temperatures). Hence both the gas and liquid axial velocities may chance in the reactor depending upon the relative magnitudes of the local absorption and desorption rates, and on the average molecular weights of the absorbed and desorbed gases. The proposed model is applicable up to a high degree of vaporization of the liquid phase. The assumption of isothermal operation may limit the use of this model to pilot scale or prototype units. The results outlined are interesting and some of them agree with the observed and expected experimental facts. The flexibility of the model may be particularly useful in scale-up considerations. The model presented for a solid distribution is quite general and is applicable over a wide range of particle sizes and solid loading encountered in industrial practice. It is also seen that settling of catalyst particles can be beneficial to a certain extent in the case of cocurrent reactors and helps to improve the yields. Too low or too high a catalyst concentration as well as too high or too low a liquid hold-up may reduce the catalytic reactions in fluidized-bed reactors.
