You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The fate of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of biosolids with alum sludge and wheat straw The literature suggests that the pyrolysis of biosolids merely volatilizes per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into gas or liquid phase, requiring a thermal oxidizer operating at 900–1200 ºC with more than 2 second residence time, to destroy the volatilized PFAS. This study investigates the potential and extent of destruction of PFAS under pyrolysis environment. Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a bench-scale horizontal fixed-bed reactor. Co-pyrolysis experiments was carried out by blending biosolids with alum sludge or wheat straw at a 1:1 (w/w) mixing ratio at 600 °C. Gas and solids residence times in the reactor were approximately 10 seconds and 1 hour, respectively. The study also explored the effects of lime and biochar as catalysts on PFAS destruction. Results showed near complete removal of PFAS from biochar with the total PFAS concentration reducing from 409.9 ng/g in biosolids to 0.31 ng/g in biochar, suggesting significant volatilization or decomposition at 600 °C. However, PFAS concentrations in volatile products were also significantly low (5.5 ng/g in bio-oil and 0.15 ng/g in scrubber water), indicating 99.4 % PFAS destruction efficiency. The co-pyrolysis of biosolids further improved PFAS removal, likely due to dilutive and synergistic effects. However, catalysis with lime and biochar did not have a significant effect on the PFAS destruction efficiency. This research highlights the potential for near complete PFAS destruction in pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis under the current experimental conditions but emphasizes the need for further investigations under the operational parameters of large-scale pyrolysis plants.
