You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of hot rolled ODS copper Dispersion strengthened copper alloys have been produced by following a powder metallurgy route that have consisted of milling copper and yttrium acetate powders in a planetary ball milling and subsequently sintering by hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In order to increase the degree of densification of the materials, they were subjected to a thermal treatment in vacuum and to a hot rolling process at 1173 K. The decomposition of the yttrium acetate during the thermal treatments resulted in the formation of voids, with a loss of densification that could not be satisfactorily improved with the hot rolling processing. The microstructure and the mechanical and thermal properties of the alloys were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattering diffraction, micro and nanohardness measurements, and compression tests and thermal conductivity measurements, both in the range 300–780 K. The best mechanical properties were obtained for the as-HIP material, with a mean grain size of 0.3 ± 0.3 μm and a yield strength value at room temperature of 520 MPa. In contrast, the material with the highest thermal conductivity for the entire range of temperature was found to be the alloy thermal treated in vacuum at 1273 K and later subjected to the hot rolling processing. The different microstructural characteristics of the alloys such as grain size, defects present in the grains and size of voids seems to be responsible of the differences on their thermal conductivity values.
