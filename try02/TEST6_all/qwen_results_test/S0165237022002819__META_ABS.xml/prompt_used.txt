You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC-MS) for the assessment of olive mill pomace composting efficiency and the effects of compost thermal treatment Composting is an interesting solution for recycling the large amount of residues typically generated in olive oil production areas, particularly olive mill pomace. Bulking agents must be added to wet olive mill pomace for composting. The diversity of the materials used (such as olive tree-pruning residues, animal manure, or straw) and the variable proportion, in which they are mixed, are responsible for the heterogeneity and variability of the quality of the produced compost. For this reason, a comprehensive characterization of compost organic matter is necessary to gain information about its stability and maturity useful as well as to predict its behavior as a soil amendment. In this work, fresh olive mill pomace and four composted olive mill pomace samples were characterized using analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). Results showed a large variety of pyrolysis products, many of which had a specific biochemical origin. Pyrolysis-GC-MS revealed a decrease in fatty acids and aliphatic compounds content with composting, along with carbohydrates degradation and an increase in phenolic and N-compounds levels. Furthermore, the differences observed in organic matter characteristics had an impact on agronomic aspects (water repellency and phytotoxicity). Thus, the occurrence of fatty acids in incompletely composted materials (mainly palmitic and cis-vaccenic acids) was associated with increased phytotoxicity and higher water repellency. The presence of chicken manure in the mixtures was proved to favor the humification process and the production of stabilized compost (characterized by a lower Aliphatic-C/Aromatic-C ratio and higher N-heterocycles content). Furthermore, in this work, the effectiveness of applying thermal treatments to improve compost quality has been evaluated. Analysis of the Py-GC-MS results by means of principal component analysis (PCA) revealed thermal rearrangement, predominantly aromatization, and loss of functional groups of carbohydrates, lignin, and proteins, at temperatures above 225 ºC. Interestingly, the results suggest that materials with a non-effective or incomplete composting process can be transformed by thermal treatment into more stable products, exhibiting similar agronomic characteristics as those have that undergone a more efficient biotransformation.
