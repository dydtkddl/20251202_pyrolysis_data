You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vacuum pyrolysed biochar for soil amendment Biochar, a highly carbonaceous charred organic material obtained from biomass conversion can be deliberately applied as a conditioner/amender in order to improve soil quality and associated environmental services. Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), a lignocellulosic biomass, can potentially be used to produce biochar. The aim of the present work is to manufacture, comprehensively characterize, and apply biochar obtained from the vacuum pyrolysis and investigate its potential for soil amendment. Biochar produced from Napier grass was characterized for its pH, electrical conductivity, soil water retention capacity, surface acidity and/or basicity, elemental composition, Infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction spectra, surface area, porosity, soil–water relation and morphological properties. Experiments on the methylene blue adsorption of the biochar indicated an equilibrium uptake capacity of 35 mg.g−1 and showed good agreement with the Langmuir–Freundlich model. Kinetic studies revealed Lagergren pseudo-first-order fit with intra-particle diffusion appearing to be one of the rate controlling mechanisms. Pot trials with Cicer grown in neutral and acidic soil amended with biochar validated that biochar augmented plant growth in terms of enhanced biomass weight and number of seed germinations. The entire investigation revealed that the properties of the produced biochar are in line with those necessary for it to act as a suitable agent for soil amendment.
