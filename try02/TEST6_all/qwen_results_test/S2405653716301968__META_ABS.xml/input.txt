Vacuum pyrolysed biochar for soil amendment Biochar, a highly carbonaceous charred organic material obtained from biomass conversion can be deliberately applied as a conditioner/amender in order to improve soil quality and associated environmental services. Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), a lignocellulosic biomass, can potentially be used to produce biochar. The aim of the present work is to manufacture, comprehensively characterize, and apply biochar obtained from the vacuum pyrolysis and investigate its potential for soil amendment. Biochar produced from Napier grass was characterized for its pH, electrical conductivity, soil water retention capacity, surface acidity and/or basicity, elemental composition, Infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction spectra, surface area, porosity, soil–water relation and morphological properties. Experiments on the methylene blue adsorption of the biochar indicated an equilibrium uptake capacity of 35 mg.g−1 and showed good agreement with the Langmuir–Freundlich model. Kinetic studies revealed Lagergren pseudo-first-order fit with intra-particle diffusion appearing to be one of the rate controlling mechanisms. Pot trials with Cicer grown in neutral and acidic soil amended with biochar validated that biochar augmented plant growth in terms of enhanced biomass weight and number of seed germinations. The entire investigation revealed that the properties of the produced biochar are in line with those necessary for it to act as a suitable agent for soil amendment.
