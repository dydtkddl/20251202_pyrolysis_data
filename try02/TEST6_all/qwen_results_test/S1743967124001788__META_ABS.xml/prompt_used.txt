You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behavior of densified refuse-derived fuels (d-RDFs) via TGA: Investigating the impact of densification degree on thermal kinetics and thermodynamics The conversion of municipal solid waste (MSW) into its energy-rich fraction, known as refuse derived fuel (RDF), addresses both MSW management and energy demand. RDF comprises a diverse blend of various non-hazardous waste streams, making it challenging to predict physical properties and chemical compositions. However, densification can help overcome these challenges. This work aims to explore the effect of densification degree on kinetic and thermodynamic parameters during the degradation of densified refuse-derived fuels (d-RDFs) in inert atmosphere. Herein, three d-RDFs samples obtained with varying degree of densification and die temperatures ranging from 55 °C to 118 °C, as well as a mixed fines (MF) sample produced during the pelletization process, were analyzed. Pyrolysis potential of d-RDFs and MF were determined using thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range from 30 to 800 °C, at multiple heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 K min−1. The effect of the degree of densification on physical characteristics, and kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of d-RDF was investigated. Apparent activation energy (Eα) was estimated employing Friedman (FR), Kissinger-Akahera-Sunnose (KAS), and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods. Derived Eα values were used to determine the pre-exponential factor (Aα) using the Kissinger method. Experimental results revealed that the durability of d-RDFs increased from 79.26 % to 98.73 % as the densification degree increased from II to IX. Furthermore, the Eα values exhibited a decreasing trend in the first peaks of the DTG profiles, while an opposite trend was observed in the second peaks of DTG curves. However, with an increase in the degree of densification, the mean values of Eα decreased by 5–10 % for all methods. The Aα values, assessed using the FR method, surpassed the critical value of (109 s−1) for all samples. However, with the KAS and FWO methods, these values fell below (109 s−1) within the conversion range of 0.05–0.25. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the endothermicity of the thermal degradation process.
