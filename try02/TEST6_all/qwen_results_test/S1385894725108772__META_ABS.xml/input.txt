Comparative techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of styrene monomer production from conventional route and waste polystyrene pyrolysis The pyrolysis of waste expanded polystyrene (EPS) is emerging as a promising approach for chemical recycling. However, its economic and environmental viability relative to conventional fossil fuel-based styrene monomer (SM) production has not been fully assessed. This study performs a techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) across three scenarios: (1) conventional SM production, (2) EPS pyrolysis, and (3) EPS pyrolysis with integrated ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to maximize SM yield. Scenarios 2 and 3 reduce energy consumption by 36–40 % compared to the conventional process and remain economically viable even at the SM selling prices lower than $500/ton. Notably, Scenario 3 retains profitability even as waste EPS prices increase, due to its higher recovery of recycled SM (r-SM), highlighting its economic robustness. Furthermore, the valorization of pyrolysis by-products significantly improves economic performance, suggesting the importance of integrating downstream utilization strategies. LCA results show that the environmental impacts of EPS pyrolysis (86.3 mPt and 95.6 mPt for Scenarios 2 and 3, respectively) are substantially lower than those associated with conventional SM production (237 mPt), primarily due to the absence of hazardous fossil-based precursors. Nevertheless, energy demands for process heating and cooling remain a major environmental burden. Therefore, reducing energy consumption is essential for improving sustainability. Overall, EPS pyrolysis, especially when combined with ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, offers a technically feasible, economically resilient, and environmentally superior route for r-SM production.
