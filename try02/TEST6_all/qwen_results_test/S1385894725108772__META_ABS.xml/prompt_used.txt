You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of styrene monomer production from conventional route and waste polystyrene pyrolysis The pyrolysis of waste expanded polystyrene (EPS) is emerging as a promising approach for chemical recycling. However, its economic and environmental viability relative to conventional fossil fuel-based styrene monomer (SM) production has not been fully assessed. This study performs a techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) across three scenarios: (1) conventional SM production, (2) EPS pyrolysis, and (3) EPS pyrolysis with integrated ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to maximize SM yield. Scenarios 2 and 3 reduce energy consumption by 36–40 % compared to the conventional process and remain economically viable even at the SM selling prices lower than $500/ton. Notably, Scenario 3 retains profitability even as waste EPS prices increase, due to its higher recovery of recycled SM (r-SM), highlighting its economic robustness. Furthermore, the valorization of pyrolysis by-products significantly improves economic performance, suggesting the importance of integrating downstream utilization strategies. LCA results show that the environmental impacts of EPS pyrolysis (86.3 mPt and 95.6 mPt for Scenarios 2 and 3, respectively) are substantially lower than those associated with conventional SM production (237 mPt), primarily due to the absence of hazardous fossil-based precursors. Nevertheless, energy demands for process heating and cooling remain a major environmental burden. Therefore, reducing energy consumption is essential for improving sustainability. Overall, EPS pyrolysis, especially when combined with ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, offers a technically feasible, economically resilient, and environmentally superior route for r-SM production.
