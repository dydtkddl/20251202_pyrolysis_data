You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of plastics/HVGO mixtures to fuels by two-step processing A blend containing 20 wt.% low density polyethylene (PE) and 5 wt.% polyvinylchloride (PVC) in heavy vacuum gas oil was pyrolyzed at 623 K (dechlorination step). This mixture was then thermally and catalytically cracked in the presence of hydrogen at 673–723 K in a batch reactor (hydrocracking step). The liquid products from hydrocracking contained no chlorine compounds although the chlorine amount in the dechlorinated mixture was 700 ppm. Experiments have shown that the dechlorination step and the temperature had great effect on the product distribution from the hydrocracking step. It was observed that the dechlorination step led to both degradation of PE and dechlorination of PVC and that PE could be completely cracked with/without a catalyst by hydrocracking even though at 673 K. The use of a catalyst decreased the gas yield and led to an increase in coke yield at 723 K. The effect of the catalyst on the boiling point range of liquid product obtained from hydrocracking depended on the reaction temperature. The chlorine compounds in dechlorinated mixture affected the catalytic activity of the catalyst especially at 723 K. 75% and 55% of the liquid products obtained at 723 K with and without a catalyst, respectively, were hydrocarbons having boiling points ranging from 323 to 473K.
