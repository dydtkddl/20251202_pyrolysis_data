You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Critical review on magnetic separable molecularly imprinted photocatalyst: Synthesis, reaction mechanism and outlook for practical applications Conventional photocatalysts have been engineered over the years to achieve high photocatalytic activity with minimum input of photon energy, by narrowing their bandgap energy, improving their adsorption capacity, and enhancing the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. However, conventional photocatalysts' selectivity has always been a gap, where undesired degradation of other molecules co-existing in the solution occurs, deteriorating degradation efficiency over the targeted molecules. Also, the challenge of separating these nanosized photocatalysts from the water environment decreases the process's sustainability. In response to the issues identified above, combining magnetic properties and molecular imprinting in photocatalysis technology has emerged as a promising solution. The basic idea of molecular imprinting is to prepare tailor-made materials with predefined recognition of certain molecules, where specific cavities are created on the material surface by using template molecules. The selective binding of the target pollutants to the recognition sites of molecularly imprinted photocatalysts (MIPs) allows more efficient utilization of photogenerated reactive species for degradation, providing faster degradation rates and lowering the overall energy consumption. Coupling the MIPs with magnetic properties, efficient and effective harvesting and regenerating can be achieved, providing a more sustainable option compared to conventional photocatalysts. To date, magnetic molecularly imprinted photocatalysts (MMIPs) with recognition and reusability properties have been employed in wastewater treatment, environmental remediation as well as sensor development. In this review paper, we explore the potential of MMIPs which their photodegradation mechanism, synthesis method and challenges, design criteria, applications, and future prospects are critically discussed.
