You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-scale modeling and control of fluidized beds for the production of solar grade silicon In this paper we develop a multi-scale model to describe the growth of silicon particles due to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR). The reactor system is designed to make poly-silicon for solar cell applications by thermal decomposition of silane. The complex interplay between the continuous and the disperse phases and CVD onto the silicon particles in the FBR is modeled using three modules — Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Reaction Module and Population Balance Module (PBM). The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) module describes the hydrodynamics via momentum, mass and heat transfer between different phases. The reaction module describes the homogeneous gas phase reactions and deposition on polycrystalline silicon particles. The population balance represents the dynamic evolution of the particle size distribution. By coupling together the modules, we provide a complete multi-scale model for the particulate CVD process. The resulting nonlinear, multi-scale model is solved using COMSOL Multi-physics and MATLAB. The results from the proposed model match the experimental data obtained from a pilot scale reactor. An inventory controller maintains the void fraction and in turn the average diameter of the silicon particles at the exit.
