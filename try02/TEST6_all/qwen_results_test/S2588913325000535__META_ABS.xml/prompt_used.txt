You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of solid waste for the production of high-value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen gas: a review The enormous amount of solid waste generated annually necessitates a transition toward circular economy strategies, especially targeting solid wastes such as waste tires, plastics, and biomass. This review explores microwave-assisted pyrolysis as a sustainable and efficient approach for converting these wastes into valuable products, specifically carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) and hydrogen gas (H2). Compared to conventional pyrolysis, microwave-assisted techniques offer superior energy efficiency, faster heating rates, and higher product quality. A core focus of this review is the significant influence of catalysts and process parameters on the outcomes of microwave pyrolysis. Transition metal catalysts, particularly iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni), have demonstrated superior performance in enhancing both H2 yield and CNMs synthesis. Bimetallic and composite catalysts exhibit enhanced microwave absorption and catalytic efficiency, making them highly suitable for this application. Moreover, critical process parameters, including microwave power, temperature, and residence time, play a pivotal role in determining product yield and quality. High microwave power and optimal temperature promote selective hydrogen generation and improve CNMs morphology, while prolonged residence time enhances gas yield. Finally, this review identifies existing knowledge gaps and outlines promising future directions for the efficient production of CNMs and hydrogen from various solid wastes using microwave-assisted pyrolysis.
