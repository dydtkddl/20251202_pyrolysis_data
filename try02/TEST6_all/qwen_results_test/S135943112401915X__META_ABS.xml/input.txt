Integrated attrition model of mechanical-thermal-reaction for CaCO3/CaO thermochemical energy storage Fluidized bed reactors have become a pivotal trend in the future development of thermochemical energy storage. However, high temperatures and chemical reactions exacerbate particle attrition in fluidized bed reactors, affecting particle cyclic stability and reducing energy storage efficiency. This study conducted experiments under three different temperature conditions to compare and investigate the attrition mechanisms of CaCO3/CaO particles. The contributions of mechanical forces from collisions, thermal stress due to uneven cooling and heating, and chemical stress from cyclic reactions to particle attrition are analyzed. The edge effects caused by sphericity dominate the attrition behavior during the initial period of fluidization. High-temperature thermal stress significantly weakens the attrition resistance of the particles, while repeated chemical cycling degrades the internal skeletal structure of the particles, lowering the fracture threshold. Based on fitting experimental data, a comprehensive numerical model for predicting particle attrition has been developed and improved by incorporating factors such as edge effects from sphericity, thermally induced stress, and chemically driven fragmentation. Through validation, the model effectively predicts particle attrition behavior in thermochemical storage process, providing a simulation tool for in-depth research on particle stability in thermochemical energy storage field.
