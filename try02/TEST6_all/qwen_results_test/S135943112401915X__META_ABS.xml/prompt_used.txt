You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrated attrition model of mechanical-thermal-reaction for CaCO3/CaO thermochemical energy storage Fluidized bed reactors have become a pivotal trend in the future development of thermochemical energy storage. However, high temperatures and chemical reactions exacerbate particle attrition in fluidized bed reactors, affecting particle cyclic stability and reducing energy storage efficiency. This study conducted experiments under three different temperature conditions to compare and investigate the attrition mechanisms of CaCO3/CaO particles. The contributions of mechanical forces from collisions, thermal stress due to uneven cooling and heating, and chemical stress from cyclic reactions to particle attrition are analyzed. The edge effects caused by sphericity dominate the attrition behavior during the initial period of fluidization. High-temperature thermal stress significantly weakens the attrition resistance of the particles, while repeated chemical cycling degrades the internal skeletal structure of the particles, lowering the fracture threshold. Based on fitting experimental data, a comprehensive numerical model for predicting particle attrition has been developed and improved by incorporating factors such as edge effects from sphericity, thermally induced stress, and chemically driven fragmentation. Through validation, the model effectively predicts particle attrition behavior in thermochemical storage process, providing a simulation tool for in-depth research on particle stability in thermochemical energy storage field.
