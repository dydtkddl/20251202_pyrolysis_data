You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ethanol steam reforming in miniaturized reaction systems for hydrogen production: Bridging the gap Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) in miniaturized systems presents a sustainable route for hydrogen production, supporting carbon emission reduction goals and exploiting ethanol as a hydrogen carrier. Key challenges include catalyst deactivation and the development of efficient reactor design. This work assesses developments of miniaturized reaction systems (MRS) for ESR, emphasizing catalyst formulation, deposition techniques, and reactor design's impact on hydrogen production. Noble metal catalysts, such as rhodium (Rh) and palladium (Pd), are efficient but costly, while nickel-based catalysts present a viable, lower-cost alternative. Bimetallic systems such as Ni–Co and Rh–Ni offer improved resistance to coking and enhanced thermal stability. Optimized MRS geometries improve thermal control and mass transfer, outperforming conventional reactors. Nonetheless, studies on advanced catalyst regeneration and coke mitigation remain limited. Coupling ESR with CO2 capture and renewable energy could enhance commercial feasibility. Future research should prioritize innovative catalysts, cost reduction, and integrated system strategies.
