Ethanol steam reforming in miniaturized reaction systems for hydrogen production: Bridging the gap Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) in miniaturized systems presents a sustainable route for hydrogen production, supporting carbon emission reduction goals and exploiting ethanol as a hydrogen carrier. Key challenges include catalyst deactivation and the development of efficient reactor design. This work assesses developments of miniaturized reaction systems (MRS) for ESR, emphasizing catalyst formulation, deposition techniques, and reactor design's impact on hydrogen production. Noble metal catalysts, such as rhodium (Rh) and palladium (Pd), are efficient but costly, while nickel-based catalysts present a viable, lower-cost alternative. Bimetallic systems such as Ni–Co and Rh–Ni offer improved resistance to coking and enhanced thermal stability. Optimized MRS geometries improve thermal control and mass transfer, outperforming conventional reactors. Nonetheless, studies on advanced catalyst regeneration and coke mitigation remain limited. Coupling ESR with CO2 capture and renewable energy could enhance commercial feasibility. Future research should prioritize innovative catalysts, cost reduction, and integrated system strategies.
