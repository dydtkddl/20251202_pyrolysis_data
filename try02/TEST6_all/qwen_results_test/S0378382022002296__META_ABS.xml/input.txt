Simultaneous removal of cadmium and lead by biochar modified with layered double hydroxide Biochar has great potential in remediation of heavy metal pollution due to the various surface heteroatomic groups and porous properties, while the conventional pyrolytic carbonization process cannot provide enough oxygen-containing functional groups for the removal efficiency and stability in the industrial application. In this study, a facile and green method to synthesize the novel biochar modified with layered double hydroxide (LDH) to enhance the heavy metal removal. The effect of LDH modification on biochar, adsorption characteristics and simultaneous adsorption mechanisms in PbCd binary system were investigated. The LDH modification would activate biochar and avoid hydrotalcite agglomeration. Comparing with bare biochar, the adsorption capacity of LDH modified biochar (KBC-LDH) was increased by 307.8% for Cd2+ (181.53 mg/g) and 254.5% for Pb2+ (368.75 mg/g). Besides, the adsorption amount and total removal efficiency first increased and then decreased with the increasing concentration of the mixed contaminants in the PbCd binary system. The addition of Pb2+ or Cd2+ with low concentration could effectively promote the adsorption capacity of another ion in the PbCd binary system, but inhibited adsorption with the further increase of the contaminant concentration. Furthermore, the repeatability and stability of KBC-LDH increased by 149.1% and 51.2% compared with bare biochar, respectively.
