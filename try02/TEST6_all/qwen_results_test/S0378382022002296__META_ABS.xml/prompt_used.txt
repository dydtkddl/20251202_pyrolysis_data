You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous removal of cadmium and lead by biochar modified with layered double hydroxide Biochar has great potential in remediation of heavy metal pollution due to the various surface heteroatomic groups and porous properties, while the conventional pyrolytic carbonization process cannot provide enough oxygen-containing functional groups for the removal efficiency and stability in the industrial application. In this study, a facile and green method to synthesize the novel biochar modified with layered double hydroxide (LDH) to enhance the heavy metal removal. The effect of LDH modification on biochar, adsorption characteristics and simultaneous adsorption mechanisms in PbCd binary system were investigated. The LDH modification would activate biochar and avoid hydrotalcite agglomeration. Comparing with bare biochar, the adsorption capacity of LDH modified biochar (KBC-LDH) was increased by 307.8% for Cd2+ (181.53 mg/g) and 254.5% for Pb2+ (368.75 mg/g). Besides, the adsorption amount and total removal efficiency first increased and then decreased with the increasing concentration of the mixed contaminants in the PbCd binary system. The addition of Pb2+ or Cd2+ with low concentration could effectively promote the adsorption capacity of another ion in the PbCd binary system, but inhibited adsorption with the further increase of the contaminant concentration. Furthermore, the repeatability and stability of KBC-LDH increased by 149.1% and 51.2% compared with bare biochar, respectively.
