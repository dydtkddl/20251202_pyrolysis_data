You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 by silanization and alkoxylation of protozeolitic units Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been synthesized by means of a method involving a precrystallization stage to form the protozeolitic units, the addition and subsequent grafting of both silanization and alkoxylation agents, and a final hydrothermal crystallization. The influence of the alkoxylation with different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and n-butanol) on the properties of the final hierarchical ZSM-5 samples has been investigated. In every case, the alcohol addition increased the incorporation of the seed silanization agent as it decreases the gel viscosity. In addition, the presence of alcohols deeply affects the physicochemical properties of the final materials. The samples prepared with 2-propanol and methanol were highly crystalline and presented improved textural properties with regard to the reference h-ZSM-5 and n-ZSM-5. In contrast, the samples obtained with ethanol and n-butanol were partially and totally X-ray amorphous, respectively. 1H and 13C-CP solid state MAS NMR spectra proved the alkoxylation of the external surface of the protozeolitic units. Catalytic cracking of LDPE pointed out the higher TOF values obtained over the hierarchical samples prepared with methanol and 2-propanol due to a right combination of accessibility and crystallinity in these materials. The differences observed among the samples prepared with alcohols were ascribed to the strong interaction produced between the silanization agent and the linear alcohols on the surface of the protozeolitic nanounits, which form a very stable protective layer, hindering their aggregation and subsequent crystallization.
