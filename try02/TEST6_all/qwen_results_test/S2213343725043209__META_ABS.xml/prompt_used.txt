You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on conventional and plasma-based technologies for landfill leachate treatment: Mechanisms, challenges, and perspectives Landfill leachate (LFL) treatment has been a global problem for a long time. Conventional treatment methods like chemical and electrochemical coagulation, adsorption, membrane separation, biological treatment, and advanced oxidation processes are hindered by limitations such as high energy demands, sludge generation, fouling, and incomplete removal of refractory organics or ammonia. Therefore, integrating plasma-based methods capable of generating reactive species to degrade persistent pollutants with conventional processes offers a pathway toward more efficient and scalable LFL remediation. In this review, the advantages and disadvantages of different technologies for LFL treatment have been discussed. Furthermore, the technological development over time in LFL treatment research, with a focus on the plasma technique, was reviewed. The mechanisms and principles of plasma technology, along with variables influencing LFL treatment, including pH, voltage, carrier gas, electrode materials, ionic strength, and catalysis, were reviewed. Various plasma reactors and their performance in several works were compared. The effectiveness of plasma in removing viruses, micropollutants, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals was evaluated. Challenges related to energy consumption and scalability of plasma systems were analyzed, providing a roadmap to guide future research and inform readers. Overall, plasma-based technologies offer a multifunctional and rapid approach to LFL treatment, particularly for sustainable organic, ammonia, and emerging pollutants without requiring additional chemicals. They demonstrate high COD and ammonia removal efficiencies (often exceeding 80 %) under ambient conditions, achieving detoxification and color reduction with minimal sludge and reduced secondary pollution. Their scalability, energy efficiency, and compatibility with hybrid configurations make plasma methods a promising solution for sustainable LFL management.
