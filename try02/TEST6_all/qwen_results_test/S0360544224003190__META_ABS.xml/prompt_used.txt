You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics study of four typical trolley case materials in passenger trains Piled-up luggage is a non-negligible fire load in passenger trains. Four mainstream trolley case materials are selected in the study, and the main components are polypropylene (TC-PP), polycarbonate (TC-PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (TC-ABS), and PC/ABS blend (TC-PC/ABS). The pyrolysis behaviors under an air atmosphere with four heating rates are tested using a thermogravimetric analyzer, and the behavior under nitrogen with a heating rate is further tested for comparison. Two model-free methods are used to obtain the activation energy (E a), and the reaction mechanism of the target materials is characterized. Moreover, the pyrolysis products are analyzed coupled with an FTIR spectrometer. The thermogravimetric results show that the pyrolysis processes of the four materials in air and nitrogen atmospheres differed significantly. The E a of TC-PP, TC-PC, TC-ABS, and TC-PC/ABS obtained by the KAS method are in the range of 82.1–294.4, 93.7–394.2, 156.5–419.3, and 152.1–313.6 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the values obtained by the Friedman method are in the range of 80.7–722.1, 63.6–448.9, 195.3–821.2, and 131.9–371.9 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The SB model is introduced to better characterize the reaction mechanism rather than a single existing theoretical model. The FTIR results demonstrate that the main pyrolysis product of the four materials under air is CO2.
