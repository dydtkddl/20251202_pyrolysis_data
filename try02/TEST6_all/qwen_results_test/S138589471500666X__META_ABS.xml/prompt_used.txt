You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Behavior of PCDF, PCDD, PCN and PCB during low temperature thermal treatment of MSW incineration fly ash For both economic and ecological reasons better knowledge of effects of incinerating waste on its persistent organic pollutant (POP) contents is needed. Thus, ash from three municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) plants was collected and analyzed for elemental composition, carbon speciation and POP (PCDF, PCDD, PCN and PCB) contents. The ash was then subjected to two thermal treatments: a small batch treatment (3g) in sealed glass ampoules and a large batch treatment (0.7kg, in a kiln) under oxygen-deficient conditions. The POP contents of the ash (and the gas phase generated by the large batch treatment) were subsequently re-analyzed. Finally, principal component analysis of congener profiles were used to clarify the POPs’ behavior in the treated ash. The results indicate that the thermal treatments had similar effects on PCDDs and PCBs, which apparently degraded but did not reform. They also had similar effects on PCDFs and PCNs, which were degraded but selectively reformed (both during and after the treatment). Furthermore, the ash composition did not significantly influence the homologue-specific congener patterns of the formed PCDFs and PCNs, but they had markedly lower chlorination degrees than those in the untreated ash and their overall toxicity was reduced by the kiln treatment, regardless of post-kiln concentrations and ash composition.
