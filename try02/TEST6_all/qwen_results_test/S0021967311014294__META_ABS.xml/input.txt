In-vial pyrolysis (PyroVial) with pre- and post-sample treatment combined with different chromatographic techniques A new generic pyrolysis unit (PyroVial) is presented. Pyrolysis is carried out in a 2mL autosampler vial placed in a XYZ robot for automated pyrolysis as well as for pre- and post-pyrolysis treatment of the sample. Analysis of the volatiles is performed by headspace analysis while the semi- and non-volatiles are extracted from the pyrolysate with an organic solvent. The features of the PyroVial are such that all chromatographic techniques can be applied. The pyrolysis unit is discussed in terms of its technical features and its performance is illustrated with applications including conventional pyrolysis, in situ and post-pyrolysis derivatization, reaction pyrolysis and catalytic cracking.
