You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Loop vs. batch reactor setups in the fractionation of birch chips using switchable ionic liquids The fractionation of lignocellulosic feedstock into its major components with high purity represents an important commercialization milestone in the transformation of lignocellulosic forest derived products into fuels and commodity chemicals. A comparison between the traditionally used batch reactor and loop reactor systems demonstrates that improved dissolution of hemicelluloses and lignin are obtained using switchable ionic liquids in a loop reactor system which facilitates decreased heat and mass transfer restrictions. The treatment of birch chips using switchable ionic liquid (SIL) based on 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene, CO2 and diethanolamine at 120 °C for 30 h in a loop reactor resulted in 24% loss of original weight of wood corresponding to dissolution of 52 wt.% of hemicelluloses and 42 wt.% of lignin, respectively, as opposed to 20% weight loss corresponding to 43 wt.% dissolution of hemicelluloses and 38 wt.% of lignin in the batch system. The non-dissolved material obtained from both reactors was efficiently fibrillated and softened cellulose fibres. The flow of switchable ionic liquid through the loop reactor and agitation of the chips enhanced the dissolution of hemicelluloses and lignin. The dissolved fractions recovered from spent SIL after treatment contained both hemicelluloses and lignin.
