Facile chemical modification of solid alkaline lignin and chitosan via nucleophilic substitution with organohalides in the vapor phase The reaction of solid alkaline lignin and chitosan with vapors of organohalides, namely allyl bromide and epichlorohydrin, is presented as a sustainable alternative to conventional solvent-based techniques for modifying these model nucleophilic biopolymers. This approach, which does not necessitate any catalysts or pre-treatments, exploits the inherent nucleophilicity of specific functional groups present in the biopolymers, such as sodium carboxylates, sodium phenolates, and amines, facilitating nucleophilic substitution reactions directly with the vapors of the modifying agents. Fuming with epichlorohydrin introduced 1,3-glyceryl bridges in both alkaline lignin and chitosan, resulting in their extensive crosslinking. Allyl bromide vapors, on the other hand, resulted in their O- or N-allylation. Allylated biopolymers showed promise as versatile starting materials for further reactions, while vapor-phase crosslinking with epichlorohydrin could effectively stabilize different biopolymer forms. This environmentally friendly, solvent-free approach offers several advantages over conventional solvent-based techniques, including reduced waste generation, simplified post-processing, and increased flexibility for recovering and reusing modifying agents, even in cases of contamination.
