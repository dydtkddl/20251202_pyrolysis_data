Thermogravimetric studies of systems pertinent to the in-situ combustion process for enhanced oil recovery. Part 1. Development of a high-pressure thermobalance A high-pressure (0–1000 psig) thermobalance experiment has been developed in order to obtain thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry data (DTG) pertinent to the in-situ combustion process for enhanced oil recovery. Studies on the pressured thermo-oxidative behaviour of 20/80 (W/W) oil/sand and coked sand samples are reported. In the case of the oil/sand sample under a 100 psig non-oxidising atmosphere, distillation/evaporation occurred below 320°C at which point thermal cracking commenced. Above 520°C only carbon-rich coke material remained. Under an oxidising air atmosphere at 100 psig, the TG curves were more complex. Below 360°C, low-temperature oxidation (LTO) competes with distillation/evaporation; hence the rate of weight loss is significantly decreased whilst fuel deposition occurs. Between 360°C and 475°C, the observed weight loss is believed to be due to a combination of hydrocarbon combustion and visbreaking or coking. Above 475°C, combustion of the remaining organic matter (high-temperature oxidation HTO) occurs. Experiments conducted using coked sand samples showed that, in air at 100 psig, the sample weight increased up to 250°C. This is attributed to the formation of oxygenated species. Above 250°C, the sample rapidly lost weight due to combustion reactions.
