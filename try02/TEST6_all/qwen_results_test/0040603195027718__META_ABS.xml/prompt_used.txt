You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric studies of systems pertinent to the in-situ combustion process for enhanced oil recovery. Part 1. Development of a high-pressure thermobalance A high-pressure (0–1000 psig) thermobalance experiment has been developed in order to obtain thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry data (DTG) pertinent to the in-situ combustion process for enhanced oil recovery. Studies on the pressured thermo-oxidative behaviour of 20/80 (W/W) oil/sand and coked sand samples are reported. In the case of the oil/sand sample under a 100 psig non-oxidising atmosphere, distillation/evaporation occurred below 320°C at which point thermal cracking commenced. Above 520°C only carbon-rich coke material remained. Under an oxidising air atmosphere at 100 psig, the TG curves were more complex. Below 360°C, low-temperature oxidation (LTO) competes with distillation/evaporation; hence the rate of weight loss is significantly decreased whilst fuel deposition occurs. Between 360°C and 475°C, the observed weight loss is believed to be due to a combination of hydrocarbon combustion and visbreaking or coking. Above 475°C, combustion of the remaining organic matter (high-temperature oxidation HTO) occurs. Experiments conducted using coked sand samples showed that, in air at 100 psig, the sample weight increased up to 250°C. This is attributed to the formation of oxygenated species. Above 250°C, the sample rapidly lost weight due to combustion reactions.
