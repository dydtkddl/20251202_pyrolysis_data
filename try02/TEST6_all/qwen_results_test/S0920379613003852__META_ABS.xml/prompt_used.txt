You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The influence of thermomechanical processing on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 13.5Cr ODS steels Reduced activation oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels are the most promising structural materials for future fusion power plants and innovative fission nuclear reactors. The structure and mechanical properties of fine-grained 13.5% Cr ODS ferritic steels, processed by hot cross rolling to large strains of 70% and subsequent annealing have been investigated. The microstructure after hot cross rolling is partially recrystallized. The texture of the ODS ferritic steel after rolling and annealing has a sharp rotated cube ({100} 〈110〉) texture component. The γ-fiber component (〈111〉||normal direction) typical of recrystallized rolled ferritic steels is absent. Similar values of tensile strength are obtained for rolled samples regardless of the sample orientation in comparison with hot isostatically pressed samples whereas a substantial enhancement in total elongation (22%) is present at 500°C. Cross-rolled ODS steels represent an increase in upper shelf energy to 2J compared with hot isostatically pressed samples. The relatively poor toughness properties, compared to 9Cr ODS RAFM steel EUROFER ODS, can be attributed mainly to the absence of the γ-fiber texture component, bimodal grain size distribution and high amounts of interstitial impurities (O, N).
