You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Breaking Barriers for a Green Future: A Comprehensive Study on Pre-treatment Techniques for Empty Fruit Bunches in the Bio-Based Economy This review article provides a comprehensive summary of the chemical and biological approaches for pretreating empty fruit bunches (EFBs), a byproduct of the palm oil industry that can be used as a feedstock for biofuels and biochemicals. However, the presence of alkali metals and alkali earth metals (AAEMs) can reduce EFB quality and limit their usage. To improve EFB quality, acid washing and biological pretreatment methods are commonly used. The different types of acids used for washing, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and citric acid, are evaluated for their effects on EFB quality under various concentrations and washing conditions, and the pros and cons of each acid-washing method are discussed. Additionally, the application of biological pretreatment techniques, such as fermentation using fungi and bacteria, is explored to improve the quality of EFBs. The impact of different fermentation conditions and microbial strains on EFB quality is assessed, and the benefits and drawbacks of each biological pretreatment method are analyzed. This review article provides a comprehensive understanding of the acid washing and biological pretreatment methods for EFBs and their impact on feedstock quality. The knowledge gained from this research can be used to optimize the pretreatment process and increase the efficiency of EFB utilization, promoting the development of a sustainable and circular bioeconomy.
