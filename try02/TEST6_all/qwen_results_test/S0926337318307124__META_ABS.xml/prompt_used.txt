You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Supported ionic liquid-like phases based on CMS/DVB with different NR3 cations as catalysts for the chlorosilanes disproportionation The variety of catalysts based on macroporous supported ionic liquid-like phases using chloromethyl styrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene (CMS/DVB) and different NR3 cations was investigated for disproportionation of trichlorosilane in a continuous-flow reactor. To determine the optimal conditions for conducting a complex catalytic process, the primary task is to determine the thermodynamical equilibrium state of the reaction system. Increase in the concentration of DCS in the system occurs from 5 to 10%, which in turn is promising in terms of considering DCS as the main precursor for the processes of epitaxial silicon growth. In addition, the maximum attainable temperature is thermodynamically optimal for the process. In the first stage, the thermal stability of the catalyst supports was determined using evolved gas analysis and all samples have a similar thermal stability 475 К. All samples have been carefully studied by SEM, AFM, EGA and nitrogen physisorption. To compare the catalytic activity of different catalytic systems on the basis of macroporous supports modified by different tritic ammonium functional groups with the subsequent activation, the kinetics of the TCS disproportionation on the catalyst sample having the highest catalytic activity was studied. The results obtained indicate that the introduction of acceptor substituents increases catalytic activity in the disproportionation of TCS. To assess the feasibility of using dichlorosilane (DCS) as a raw material for the creation of semiconductor structures, the kinetics of thermal decomposition of DCS in a mixture with hydrogen was studied at a temperature of 1200–1500 K. According to the obtained kinetic results, the activation energy of the process is determined, which is in the temperature range of 1220–1320 K and the concentration of DCS in hydrogen 9–28.6 mol.%, is 112.9 kJ/mol. Activation energy value indicates the kinetical mode of the thermal decomposition.
