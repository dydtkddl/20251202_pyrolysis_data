You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling the conditioning correlation in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins towards designated conversion into valuable products The ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefin plastics holds promise for producing aromatics and light olefins, with potential integrations in the low-carbon olefin processing industry for producing ethylene, propylene, butadiene, or aromatic hydrocarbons. Employing ZSM-5(50) zeolite, selected for its substantial specific surface area and total pore volume, facilitated the catalytic pyrolysis of household plastic waste through an ex-situ pyrolysis-catalysis approach. This study explored the impact of operating parameters, T1-T2- C/P mass ratio, namely pyrolysis temperature, catalytic vapor upgrading temperature, and the catalyst/plastic mass ratio, on pyrolysis product yields and distributions. Higher T2 benefited gas production, accompanied by a notable decrease in C4 content in gaseous products. A larger C/P mass ratio provided more active sites for pyrolysis reactions, but higher T2 induced coke formation on the catalyst, leading to ZSM-5(50) deactivation and inhibiting further gas production. Positive effects of T2 and the C/P mass ratio were observed for the concentration of BTX in the produced oil. The quadratic fitting was engaged in characterising the reaction conditions. Specifically, the 500–550–0.25 run achieved the maximum C2 yield of 30.3 wt%, the 500–350–0.4 run obtained the highest yield of C3 and C4 of 75.4 wt%, and the run of 575–450–0.25 yielded the highest amount of BTX of 17.2 wt%. These findings provide valuable insights into the designated conditioning of catalytic pyrolysis for plastic waste valorisation.
