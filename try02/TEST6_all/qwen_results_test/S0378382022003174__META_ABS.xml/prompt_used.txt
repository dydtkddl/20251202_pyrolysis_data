You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of operating conditions for anisole hydrodeoxygenation reaction over Zr-based metal–organic framework supported Pt catalyst To optimize the operating conditions for catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of anisole in a continuous fixed-bed reactor, the response surface methodology combined with the central composite design was used to maximize the conversion by tuning the molar ratio of H2 to anisole, temperature, and pressure, which are considered key parameters on catalytic reaction. Analysis of variance was used to determine the regression model's compatibility. The catalyst was prepared using a Zr-based metal–organic framework, UiO-67, as a support, which was synthesized under microwave-assisted solvothermal reaction, followed by loading Pt nanoparticles on its surface via a double solvent method. The results demonstrated that the obtained mathematical model accurately predicted the conversion, which was more greatly influenced by temperature in comparison with the H2/anisole molar ratio and pressure in HDO reaction over the 3 wt% Pt/UiO-67 catalyst. Concurrently, the highest conversion of 92.5% was obtained under the optimum conditions: H2/anisole molar ratio of 35.2, reaction temperature of 297.6 °C, and a reaction pressure of 12.8 bar. The relative error was only 1.08% when compared with experimental values obtained under near-optimum conditions. Furthermore, at high temperatures, the reaction pathway followed the demethoxylation trend, yielding cyclohexane and benzene as the main products.
