You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal Co-liquefaction of Cellulose and Polypropylene using Co-solvents Hydrothermal co-liquefaction of feedstocks that decompose in widely different temperature regimes is a promising strategy to convert thermally stable olefinic plastics at sub-critical conditions by utilizing the synergetic interactions between the intermediates generated from biopolymers and synthetic polymers. In this study, cellulose and polypropylene (PP) are co-liquefied, and the effects of temperature (300–350 °C), residence time (15–45 min), cellulose-to-PP mass ratio (25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 w%/w%) and co-solvents (glycerol, paraffin oil) on product yields and quality are thoroughly studied. Results suggest that water alone is inadequate to liquefy PP, while the incorporation of glycerol and paraffin oil greatly enhance the conversion and the bio-crude yield. Maximum bio-crude yield (78.6 wt.%) was obtained at 350 °C-30 min with cellulose:PP of 50:50 w%/w% using water:glycerol solvent. The selectivity to aliphatic hydrocarbons in the bio-crude was high (∼96.5 %) at 350 °C-15 min for a cellulose:PP ratio of 25:75 w%/w% in water-paraffin oil solvent.
