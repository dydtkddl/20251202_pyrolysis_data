You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of mass transfer and thermal cracking during the coking of Athabasca residues The kinetics of thermal cracking of films of vacuum residue from Athabasca bitumen in the temperature range of 457 – 530 ∘ C was modelled with liquid-phase mass transfer, reaction-dependent fluid properties, and coke formation by reaction of cracked products in the liquid phase. Previous investigations on the thermal cracking of vacuum residue in thin films showed that at low film thickness ( ∼ 20 ± 2 μ m ) the coke yield was insensitive to the temperature and heating rate for thin films of bitumen. The coke yield increased with the thickness of the initial film, in the range from 20 to 80 μ m ( ± 2 μ m ) . At the same time, the viscosity of the reacting liquid increased rapidly with time, which would slow down the diffusion of products inside the film. This coupling of transport and reaction would enhance the formation of coke by increasing the rate of recombination reactions. The concept of intrinsic coke is used in a new kinetic model to account for the minimum observed coke formation in thin films. With increasing film thickness, the increasing yield of extrinsic coke is modelled through the change in fluid properties as a function of extent of reaction, which reduces the rate of diffusion in the reacting liquid phase. The model was able to properly account for the insensitivity of coke yield in thin films to reaction temperature and the dependence of coke yield on the thickness of the liquid film.
