Towards fuels production by a catalytic pyrolysis of a real mixture of post-consumer plastic waste The contribution provides a valorization alternative for rejected plastic wastes from mechanical-biological treatment (non-recyclable material) via an in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process focused on the production of a liquid fraction with similar properties to traditional fuels (i.e., gasoline, kerosine, and diesel). According to the ASTM recommendations, on small samples without prior physical separation, fuel fraction identification was carried out by Simulated Distillation along with a hydrocarbon types analysis and complemented with CHNS-O analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Two catalytic structures were employed named Sepiolite and Montmorillonites, both K10 and K30, which after simple heat treatment to stabilize the structure, were characterized to analyze the main properties affecting the catalytic activity and product yields (i.e., morphological and acidity properties). A whole screaming of the products by analogy with hydrocarbon of the petroleum industry is presented. Such an approach allows a real evaluation of the studied technology in the current energy scenario.
