Hydrogen and syngas production from propane and polyethylene Hybrid filtration combustion of propane in a porous medium composed of aleatory polyethylene pellets and alumina spheres is studied to examine the suitability of the concept for hydrogen and syngas production. Temperature, velocity, and chemical products of the combustion waves were recorded experimentally in the range of equivalence ratios from stoichiometry (φ = 1.0) to φ = 1.65. The model predictions for combustion in inert porous media using GRI 3.0 reaction mechanism are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data. Hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide are dominant combustion products for upstream sub-adiabatic temperatures recorder in all the range of equivalence ratios studied. The maximum hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields are close to 48% and 89%, respectively.
