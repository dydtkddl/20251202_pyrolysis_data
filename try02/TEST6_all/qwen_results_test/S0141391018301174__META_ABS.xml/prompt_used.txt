You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study of the photochemical stability of HDPE/Ag composites In the present study, HDPE composites containing different concentrations of silver (Ag) nanoparticles (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 5 wt%) were prepared by melt mixing on a Haake-Buchler Reomixer. Composites in the form of thin films were exposed to UV irradiation at 280 nm at constant temperature (25 °C) and relative humidity (50%) for several hours. The samples were characterized for their photochemical stability with several methods. From FTIR spectroscopy it was found that new chemical compounds were formed during UV exposure containing carbonyl, vinyl, and hydroxyl/hydroxyperoxide groups. According to the spectra, the nanoparticles act as inhibitors to the photo-oxidation mechanism of the polymer matrix. Moreover, as the loading of nanoparticles increased, better protection was achieved. Further study of the samples was performed using tensile strength tests, showing that neat HDPE was affected significantly by UV irradiation, while its composites with Ag were affected in a lower extend. The greater the loading of the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, the more they reduce the mobility of the molecules, thus inhibiting the chain scission of HDPE. Degree of crystallinity was also affected from UV exposure time and the addition of nanoparticles. Finally, the mechanism of thermal degradation of HDPE and its composite with 1 wt% Ag before and after UV exposure was studied by Pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS).
