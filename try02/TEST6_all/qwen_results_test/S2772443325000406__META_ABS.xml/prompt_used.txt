You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of wastewater treatment methods for palm oil mill effluent (POME): A comprehensive review As the world’s largest palm oil producer, Indonesia significantly benefits from its palm oil industry but also faces serious environmental challenges from palm oil mill effluent (POME)—a high-strength wastewater containing substantial organic matter, nutrients, suspended solids, and various chemical compounds. Sustainable and effective wastewater treatment strategies are urgently needed to address this issue. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of existing POME treatment technologies, including anaerobic digestion (AD), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), membrane filtration, adsorption, phytoremediation, and microalgae-based systems. Each method is examined in terms of treatment efficiency, operational feasibility, and potential for implementation under Indonesian conditions. While advanced processes, such as AOPs and membrane filtration, achieve high pollutant removal, they are often limited by operational costs. In contrast, biological approaches, such as AD and phytoremediation, offer both environmental benefits and economic value through the recovery of biogas, biofertilizers, and biomass. This review highlights the potential for integrating wastewater purification with resource recovery and valorization, supporting a shift toward more circular and sustainable management of POME. The insights provided are intended to guide future research, inform policy decisions, and facilitate the industrial adoption of optimized treatment systems.
