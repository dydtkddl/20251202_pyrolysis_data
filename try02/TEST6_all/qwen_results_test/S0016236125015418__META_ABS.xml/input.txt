In-situ DRIFTS and kinetic-thermodynamic evaluation of dry reforming of methane over La-modified alumina-supported Ni-Ce-Fe catalyst Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a dual-purpose approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously producing syngas. Unraveling DRM mechanisms necessitates a combined interrogation of thermodynamic driving forces, transient surface species transformations, and rate-determining steps. Here, the study presents an integrated approach that combines thermodynamic assessment, kinetic modeling, and in-situ DRIFTS analysis to investigate the DRM reaction over the catalyst (Ni-Ce-Fe/La2O3-Al2O3) synthesized through the citrate sol–gel method. Catalyst characterization revealed that the La incorporation promotes the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel and strengthens metal-support interactions. Catalytic performance was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor, exhibiting the highest conversions of CO2 and CH4 at approximately 92 % and 86 %, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that above 625 °C, the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction becomes thermodynamically favorable alongside DRM, contributing to CO2 consumption and H2 depletion, which resulted in a lower H2/CO ratio and high CO2 conversion. In-situ DRIFTS studies revealed the formation of surface intermediates such as bicarbonate, monodentate, and bidentate carbonates during CO2 adsorption. Kinetic modeling based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) model identified methane associative adsorption as the rate-limiting step, with activation energy for CH4 activation estimated at ∼70 kJ/mol and enthalpy for CO2 adsorption around ∼65 kJ/mol.
