You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ DRIFTS and kinetic-thermodynamic evaluation of dry reforming of methane over La-modified alumina-supported Ni-Ce-Fe catalyst Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a dual-purpose approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously producing syngas. Unraveling DRM mechanisms necessitates a combined interrogation of thermodynamic driving forces, transient surface species transformations, and rate-determining steps. Here, the study presents an integrated approach that combines thermodynamic assessment, kinetic modeling, and in-situ DRIFTS analysis to investigate the DRM reaction over the catalyst (Ni-Ce-Fe/La2O3-Al2O3) synthesized through the citrate sol–gel method. Catalyst characterization revealed that the La incorporation promotes the formation of NiAl2O4 spinel and strengthens metal-support interactions. Catalytic performance was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor, exhibiting the highest conversions of CO2 and CH4 at approximately 92 % and 86 %, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that above 625 °C, the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction becomes thermodynamically favorable alongside DRM, contributing to CO2 consumption and H2 depletion, which resulted in a lower H2/CO ratio and high CO2 conversion. In-situ DRIFTS studies revealed the formation of surface intermediates such as bicarbonate, monodentate, and bidentate carbonates during CO2 adsorption. Kinetic modeling based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) model identified methane associative adsorption as the rate-limiting step, with activation energy for CH4 activation estimated at ∼70 kJ/mol and enthalpy for CO2 adsorption around ∼65 kJ/mol.
