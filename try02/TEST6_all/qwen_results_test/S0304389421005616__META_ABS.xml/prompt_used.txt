You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into degradation mechanism of sulfamethoxazole by metal-organic framework derived novel magnetic Fe@C composite activated persulfate Novel Fe@C composites derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) were synthesized. Being subject to pyrolysis under different temperatures endows these Fe@Cs diverse physical-chemical properties, including morphology, crystal structure, defect level, magnetism, and most importantly, iron phase composition. Fe@C-800 consists mainly of Fe3C and α-Fe, thus possesses strong ferromagnetic properties, which imparts the ability to be separated and recycled. Its catalytic activity towards the activation of persulfate (PS) and the decomposition of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was found to be the best among all the Fe@Cs, and this activity can be regenerated by simple heat treatment. Given the mixed form of iron and N-doped carbon, α-Fe/Fe3C species provide electrons for PS to decompose and generate sulfate radical (SO4·−), hydroxyl radical (·OH), and superoxide radical (O2·−), initiating the radical pathway for partial SMX degradation. The positively charged C atoms on PS bonded Fe@C, as well as the conversion of O2·− give rise to the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2), which was responsible for the non-radical pathway for SMX degradation. As a consequence, SMX was degraded to intermediates through five degradation pathways, and finally mineralized to inorganic molecules. The results indicate that Fe@C-800 has great potential to serve as a promising activator for persulfate-mediated environmental remediation.
