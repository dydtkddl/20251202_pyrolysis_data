You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of poultry manure into biochar, bio-oil and gas product by co-pyrolysis with residual biomass and the effects analysis of the feedstock on products yield and their characteristics Co-pyrolysis is an effective way to convert poultry manure into useful products and to reduce environment pollution. In this work a new strategy of valorization of poultry manure (PM) through rapid co-pyrolysis with various biomass feedstocks is studied. The effects of the used biomass kind on the composition and yield of the resulted products was assessed.The effect of co-pyrolysis feedstocks on biocar, bio-oil and gas yield and their properties were studied by mixing poultry manure(PM) with corn stalks (CS), wheat straws (WS) and pine sawdust (PS) in a mass ratio of 2:1, and performing a thermal decomposition in a fluidized bed reactor, inert atmosphere and at temperature of 550 OC. The results showed that by PM pyrolysis the bio-oil yield was 42.02 wt%), the biochar yield was 37.22 wt% and the gas product was 20.75 wt%.Co-pyrolysis of PM with CS, WS or PS, substantially improved the quality of biochar, bio-oil and gaseous product. The addition of biomass reduced the yield of biochar but increased its calorific value and the thermal stability. During the co-pyrolysis, the addition of CS, WS or PS produced bio-oil with lower nitrogenated and oxygenated compounds content, lower viscosity and a higher HHV, compared to PM pyrolysis bio-oil.The PM co-pyrolysis with CS, WS or PS, increased the gas yield and its heating value.This results show that through co-pyrolysis, PM could be reused into producing of biochar, bio-oil and gas with improved characteristics, compared to the products resulting only from PM pyrolysis.
