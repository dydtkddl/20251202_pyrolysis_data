Valorization of poultry manure into biochar, bio-oil and gas product by co-pyrolysis with residual biomass and the effects analysis of the feedstock on products yield and their characteristics Co-pyrolysis is an effective way to convert poultry manure into useful products and to reduce environment pollution. In this work a new strategy of valorization of poultry manure (PM) through rapid co-pyrolysis with various biomass feedstocks is studied. The effects of the used biomass kind on the composition and yield of the resulted products was assessed.The effect of co-pyrolysis feedstocks on biocar, bio-oil and gas yield and their properties were studied by mixing poultry manure(PM) with corn stalks (CS), wheat straws (WS) and pine sawdust (PS) in a mass ratio of 2:1, and performing a thermal decomposition in a fluidized bed reactor, inert atmosphere and at temperature of 550 OC. The results showed that by PM pyrolysis the bio-oil yield was 42.02 wt%), the biochar yield was 37.22 wt% and the gas product was 20.75 wt%.Co-pyrolysis of PM with CS, WS or PS, substantially improved the quality of biochar, bio-oil and gaseous product. The addition of biomass reduced the yield of biochar but increased its calorific value and the thermal stability. During the co-pyrolysis, the addition of CS, WS or PS produced bio-oil with lower nitrogenated and oxygenated compounds content, lower viscosity and a higher HHV, compared to PM pyrolysis bio-oil.The PM co-pyrolysis with CS, WS or PS, increased the gas yield and its heating value.This results show that through co-pyrolysis, PM could be reused into producing of biochar, bio-oil and gas with improved characteristics, compared to the products resulting only from PM pyrolysis.
