You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of alumina support on the performance of Pt-Sn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of isobutane Alumina supports were synthesized by hydrochloric acid reflux and ammonia precipitation methods; after that the Pt-Sn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by complex impregnation method under vacuum with alumina of different sources as the supports. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, CO pulse chemisorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis; the effect of the alumina support on the performance of Pt-Sn-K/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of isobutane was investigated. Compared with the catalyst supported on Al2O3 from hydrochloric acid reflux, the catalyst supported on the Al2O3 from ammonia precipitation is provided with smaller platinum particle size and weaker acidic distribution, and then exhibits higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in isobutane dehydrogenation. Moreover, the catalyst with Al2O3 synthesized by ammonia precipitation as the support exhibits better resistance against coke deposition and the coke deposited also has a lower degree of graphitization, which endues the catalyst with better stability. During a long term test of 14 d over the catalyst with Al2O3 synthesized by ammonia precipitation as the support, the conversion of isobutane is initially 56.67% and then decreased to 34.71% after 14 d; meanwhile, the initial selectivity to isobutene is 80% and it remains approximate 94% after 7 d.
