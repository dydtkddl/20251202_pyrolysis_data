You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on clay exfoliation methods and modifications for CO2 capture application Carbon capture, utilization, and storage techniques are required to address concerns related to global warming resulting from the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. Currently, amine-based solvents are commonly used for post-combustion CO2 capture. The amine-based (liquid) sorption technology has numerous disadvantages including the perilous by-products and a high-energy prerequisite for their regeneration. Thus, extensive research is ongoing worldwide to develop cost-effective, sustainable, environmentally friendly, and effective sorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture. The distinctive features of clay-based materials make them particularly promising for CO2 adsorption. This critical review explores the current technology, adsorbents, and challenges associated with CO2 capture and finding answers in exploring exfoliated clay-based adsorbents as porous, high-surface area, inexpensive, efficient, and compatible materials for CO2 capture. Specifically, the review narrates a summary of various procedures useful for clay exfoliation and discusses a variety of chemical, inorganic, and organic modifications for designing exfoliated clay-based nanocomposites for CO2 capture. Further, the review touches upon various practical ways to prepare exfoliated clay-based composites, as membranes, aerogels, and nanofluids, for CO2 capture.
