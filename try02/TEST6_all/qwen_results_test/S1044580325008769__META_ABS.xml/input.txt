Effects of heat treatment on microstructure, mechanical properties and irradiation response of LPBF GH3535 superalloy Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a promising approach for the structural optimization of components in next generation advanced reactors. However, AM alloys often struggle to achieve a balanced combination of the mechanical properties and irradiation resistance. In this study, a novel GH3535 superalloy with a theoretical density of 99.996 % was fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), followed by a two-step heat treatment consisting of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and solid solution heat treatment (SSHT). The properties of three types of LPBF GH3535 samples were compared to assess the influence of heat treatment on their microstructure and mechanical properties. Tensile testing revealed that the LPBF-HIP-SSHT sample exhibited superior ductility compared to the LPBF sample, both at room temperature and 700 °C. Nanoindentation tests were conducted to evaluate the irradiation hardening behavior of the alloys. TEM analysis and helium bubble statistical evaluation showed that the LPBF and LPBF-HIP-SSHT samples had similar helium bubble sizes and number densities. When compared to the LPBF-HIP sample, the LPBF-HIP-SSHT GH3535 alloy demonstrated superior helium tolerance and enhanced resistance to irradiation hardening, largely attributed to the presence of a significant amount of nano-carbides. This study offers important insights into the design and optimization of LPBF GH3535 for nuclear industry applications.
