You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-density polyethylene-derived carbon nanotubes from express packaging bags waste as electrode material for supercapacitors A simple and efficient method for disposing of waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) express packaging bags is proposed in this paper as a way to minimize waste and address the energy shortage at the same time. In addition to following the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) derived from LDPE, the application of CNTs as electrodes for supercapacitors was attempted. Waste LDPE bags were pyrolyzed and carbonized with catalyst using a dual-temperature reaction system, a designed 450 °C pyrolysis temperature accompany with different carbonization temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, 800 °C, 850 °C), and treatment durations (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h) were investigated. As determined by FE-SEM and FE-TEM, the CNTs synthesized at 750 °C showed a finer tube diameter, much more uniform distribution, bamboo-like structure, as well as the highest yield of 41.9 %, and carbon conversion of 61.2 %. As being charged and discharged 10,000 times, the electrode remained a 93.16 % capacitance and a 92.85 % Coulomb efficiency. A dual-temperature reaction system could be utilized to recycle waste LDPE efficiently, and the LDPE-derived CNTs could be applied for supercapacitors.
