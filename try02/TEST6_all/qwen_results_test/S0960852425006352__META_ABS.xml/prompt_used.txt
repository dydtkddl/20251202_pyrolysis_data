You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ catalytic hydrogenation-liquefaction of lignin: Role of heat and mass transfer A novel method that combined in-situ hydrogenation-liquefaction and intensified heat and mass transfer was proposed for efficient catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin. The strategy enhanced heat and mass transfer, significantly accelerating lignin conversion from 79.30 wt% to 89.22 wt%, with the deoxidation rate rising from 1.27% to 68.53% and bio-oil HHV reaching 33.51 MJ/kg. Under these conditions, applying Ni/β-Al2O3, Ni/MgO-Al2O3, and Ni/MgO catalysts further increased bio-oil HHV to 33.54, 33.58, and 34.84 MJ/kg, respectively, while maintaining conversion efficiency. These catalysts with different metal-support interactions and acid-basic sites exhibited varied adsorption and hydrogenation characteristics, leading to aromatic hydrocarbon yield of 6.00–7.09%, and phenolic concentration increased from 61.37% to 82.53%. The performance was attributed to adsorption selectivity coupled with intensified heat and mass transfer, and the catalysts’ mesopore properties mitigated mass transfer limitations in pores, facilitating selective adsorption/desorption and CO bond cleavage of intermediates on active sites.
