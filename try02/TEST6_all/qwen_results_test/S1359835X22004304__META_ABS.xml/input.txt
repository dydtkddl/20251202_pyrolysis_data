A review of milled carbon fibres in composite materials Milled carbon fibres are a short form of carbon fibre, typically ∼ 100 µm in length, used as a reinforcing material in the composites industry. The applications for milled fibre including structural reinforcement, sensor technology, electrical conductivity, and material multifunctionality are of inherent interest within, and beyond the composites sector. However, a unified body of knowledge to consolidate the current understanding and scope of milled fibre remains absent. This review provides a summary of the major streams of milled carbon fibre research and development and elucidates some of the economical and logistical concerns for implementing the research advancements into industrial settings.
