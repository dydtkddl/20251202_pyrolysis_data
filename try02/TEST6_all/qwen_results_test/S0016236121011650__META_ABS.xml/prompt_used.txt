You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Core-shell Na2WO4/CuMn2O4 oxygen carrier with high oxygen capacity for chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) of ethane utilizes lattice oxygen of oxygen carrier, to substitute molecular oxygen, which makes high oxygen capacity as significant as ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity. Promoter were usually used to increased ethylene selectivity of bare oxygen carriers, but the overall oxygen capacity is limited to 3 wt%. In the current work, a core-shell oxygen carrier with Na2WO4 as the shell material and spinel-type CuMn2O4 as oxygen source was prepared. The core-shell structure were characterized by SEM, HTEM and XPS. Deep reduction with thirty consecutive ethane pulses was exhibited in a fixed bed. At 720 °C, up to 58.8% ethane conversion, 86.4% ethylene selectivity, and effective oxygen capacity up to 4.8 wt% were achieved with H2 conversion > 90%. Furthermore, in the light of effective oxygen capacity, the phase transformation from CuMn2O4 to Cu, MnO, Mn3O4 and CuMnO2 is determined as the desired phase change for this CL-ODH process. The connection between the dynamic phase change and the enlarged oxygen capacity will also shed light in future oxygen carrier design for chemical looping processes for chemical productions.
