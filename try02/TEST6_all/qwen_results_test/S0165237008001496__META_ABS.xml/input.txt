Influence of FCC catalyst steaming on HDPE pyrolysis product distribution A commercial FCC catalyst based on a zeolite active phase has been used in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE. The experimental runs have been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor provided with a feeding system for continuous operation. Different treatments have been applied to the catalyst to improve its behaviour. This paper deals with the optimization of catalyst steaming and pyrolysis temperature in order to maximize the production of diesel-oil fraction. The performance of the fresh catalyst has been firstly studied at 500°C. This catalyst gives way to 52wt% gas yield, 35wt% light liquid fraction and a low yield of C10 + fraction (13wt%). After mild steaming (5h at 760°C) the results show a significant improvement in product distribution. Thus, gas yield decreases to 22wt%, the yield of light liquid is similar to that of the fresh one (38wt%), whereas the yield of the desired C10 + fraction increases to 38wt%. Nevertheless, the best results have been obtained when a severe steaming is applied to the catalyst (8h at 816°C) and pyrolysis temperature is reduced to 475°C. There is a significant reduction in the gaseous fraction (8wt%). The light liquid fraction has also been reduced to 22wt%, but the yield of diesel fraction increases to 69wt%. Moreover, the deactivation of the catalyst has also been studied under the optimum conditions.
