You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of FCC catalyst steaming on HDPE pyrolysis product distribution A commercial FCC catalyst based on a zeolite active phase has been used in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE. The experimental runs have been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor provided with a feeding system for continuous operation. Different treatments have been applied to the catalyst to improve its behaviour. This paper deals with the optimization of catalyst steaming and pyrolysis temperature in order to maximize the production of diesel-oil fraction. The performance of the fresh catalyst has been firstly studied at 500°C. This catalyst gives way to 52wt% gas yield, 35wt% light liquid fraction and a low yield of C10 + fraction (13wt%). After mild steaming (5h at 760°C) the results show a significant improvement in product distribution. Thus, gas yield decreases to 22wt%, the yield of light liquid is similar to that of the fresh one (38wt%), whereas the yield of the desired C10 + fraction increases to 38wt%. Nevertheless, the best results have been obtained when a severe steaming is applied to the catalyst (8h at 816°C) and pyrolysis temperature is reduced to 475°C. There is a significant reduction in the gaseous fraction (8wt%). The light liquid fraction has also been reduced to 22wt%, but the yield of diesel fraction increases to 69wt%. Moreover, the deactivation of the catalyst has also been studied under the optimum conditions.
