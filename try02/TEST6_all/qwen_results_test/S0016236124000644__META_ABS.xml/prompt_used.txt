You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of industrial aromatic oils as potential hydrogen carriers: Study of the hydrogenation step Industrial organic streams (oils) with high concentration of aromatics compounds are present in different carbochemical and petrochemical processes. These aromatic compounds are potential hydrogen carriers through hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycles. For this purpose, catalytic hydrogenation of three different aromatic oils using conventional hydrogenation catalysts is considered in this work. Two oil samples (petrochemical Oil A and carbochemical Oil B) enriched with polyaromatic compounds, along with a manufactured oil of petrochemical origin (SolvessoTM 200), were hydrogenated using Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The study aims to work under mild conditions to avoid secondary reactions and cracking, which is important for using these oils as potential LOHCs. The methodology involved using a stainless-steel autoclave reactor and analysing the composition of the oils and reaction products using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Diaromatic compounds were found to be the most reactive, reactant conversion depending on the catalyst and reaction temperature. However, the presence of tri and tetra-aromatic compounds hinder the reaction. Moreover, nitrogenated aromatic compounds are extremely reactive at these conditions. Comparison of SolvessoTM 200 with benzyltoluene, an established LOHC, resulted in promising results. Thus, both Oil A and B, after a purification step, would have interesting qualities to be used as LOHCs with the added advantage of its low price.
