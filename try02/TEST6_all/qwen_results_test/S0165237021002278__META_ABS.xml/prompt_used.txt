You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ex-situ catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapors using mixed metal oxides Ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) was employed to produce bio-oils from beech wood. The effect of Nb-based mixed oxides (with second metal oxide = W, Al or Mn) in upgrading the pyrolysis vapors was compared to an H-ZSM-5 catalyst and to non-catalyzed pyrolysis. The catalysts acidic properties were assessed by NH3-TPD and FTIR of adsorbed pyridine. The bio-oils obtained were characterized by Karl-Fischer titration, GPC, CHNS analyses, 13C-NMR, GC–MS, GCxGC–MS. In spite their very different acidic properties, the NbxMnyOz catalyst (with essentially Lewis acid sites) exhibited similar performances as H-ZSM-5 (that presents a high density of Brønsted sites), in terms of liquid phase selectivity and reduction of oxygen content in the bio-oils produced. These observations were accompanied by a reduction of compounds such as acids, aldehydes, ketones, ethers and sugars that contribute to the detrimental properties of bio-oils. Finally, the results suggest that the Lewis acid sites of NbxMnyOz are converted into Brønsted sites in the presence of water vapor produced by pyrolysis of wood, whereas the strongest Brønsted sites of H-ZSM-5 have a limited impact on the upgrading process due to their limited accessibility for most components of pyrolysis vapors.
