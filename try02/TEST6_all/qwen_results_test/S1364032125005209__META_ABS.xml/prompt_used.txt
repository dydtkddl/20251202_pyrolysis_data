You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Abnormal combustion and NOx emissions control strategies of hydrogen internal combustion engine Fossil fuel use raises concerns regarding environmental pollution and limited storage capacity. Internal combustion engines significantly depend on the conventional gasoline and diesel, emphasizing the need for alternative fuels. Hydrogen is currently gaining attention as a potential clean energy alternative to traditional fossil fuels owing to its zero carbon emissions, high energy density, fast refueling, compatibility with the existing infrastructure, flexibility, and versatility. Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines signifies a paradigm shift in the engine community toward cleaner and more sustainable transportation solutions. However, challenges such as production costs, distribution infrastructure, and security requirements must be addressed for widespread use. Ongoing research aims to overcome these challenges and enhance the feasibility of using hydrogen as a carbon-free energy source for the engines. This study comprehensively overviews recent research progress and advancements in hydrogen internal combustion engine in terms of the mixture formation mechanism, combustion modes, abnormal combustion mechanism, and the formation mechanism of the nitrogen oxide emissions. In addition, advanced combustion control strategies and technologies have been proposed and summarized to regulate abnormal combustion and nitrogen oxide emissions in the hydrogen engine. The main objectives of this study are to overcome or address these challenges and problems and further enhance the feasibility of hydrogen as a carbon-free alternative fuel for the engine.
