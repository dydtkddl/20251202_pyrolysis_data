You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Developing the sensing mechanism of high-performance N2H4 sensors derived from waste cotton stalk using a one-step process The detection of hydrazine (N2H4), a highly toxic and explosive compound, is of paramount importance for ensuring environmental and industrial safety. However, research on chemoresistive gas sensors for N2H4 detection, particularly the underlying mechanisms, remains limited. To address this gap, we have prepared carbon materials with a unique morphology and trace K doping through a simple carbonization process, utilizing raw cotton straw (RCS) as the starting material. The CS-400 sensor obtained under calcination at 400 °C exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity for N2H4, with a response of 30.6 k% and a detection limit of 0.55 ppm for 500 ppm N2H4 at room temperature. Subsequently, the gas sensing mechanism of the straw-based biochar material was focused on, and the roles of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the RCS were analyzed. The interaction between defects and carrier concentration during pyrolysis was elucidated. First-principles calculations confirmed that trace K doping and surface adsorbed oxygen enhance the adsorption of target gases, thereby improving the sensor performance.
