Atomic layer deposition (ALD) assisting the visibility of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) technologies Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have been thought to be magic powers with unlimited applications. However, their powdered condition presents difficulty in utilizing them widely in practices. Depending on the envisioned applications, MOFs will be desired to integrate as an application-oriented forms for example thin films into a microelectronic device to achieve the desired performance. In the last decades, atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a truly enabling technology has become the method of choice for films deposition with good quality-control. In this regard, ALD promises to deposit MOFs films onto the target substrates and assist the visibility of MOFs technologies by facilitating MOFs devices integration. This review will collect together the published work that addresses the past ALD research efforts towards MOFs devices integration. Meanwhile, some beneficial concepts from other technological matrix are also pulled in to sparkle the thinking. We aim to provide an understanding on how the ALD technique is currently assisting the visibility of MOFs technologies.
