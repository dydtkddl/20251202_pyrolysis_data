You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green hydrogen production by brewery spent grain valorization through gasification and membrane separation towards fuel-cell grade purity This study focuses on the potential valorization of brewers' spent grain (BSG) through gasification for ultra-pure green hydrogen production via membrane separation. First, a fundamental physicochemical characterization of BSG samples from two different Spanish brewing industries was conducted, revealing high energy content and good reproducibility of elemental composition, thus providing great potential for hydrogen generation in the context of circular economy for the brewery industry. The syngas composition reached by BSG gasification has been predicted and main operating conditions optimized to maximize the hydrogen yield (25–75 vol% air-steam mixture ratio, GR = 0.75, T = 800 °C and P = 5 bar). For gas purification, two Pd-membranes were fabricated by ELP-PP onto tubular PSS supports with high reproducibility (Pd-thickness in the range 8.22–8.75 μm), exhibiting an almost complete H2-selectivity, good fitting to Sieverts’ law and hydrogen permeate fluxes ranging from 175 to 550 mol m−2 h−1 under ideal gas feed composition conditions. The mechanical resistance of membranes was maintained at pressure driving forces up to 10 bar, thus highlighting their potential for commercialization and industrial application. Furthermore, long-term stability tests up to 75 h indicated promising membrane performance for continuous operation, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the brewery industry to enhance economic growth and environmental sustainability through green hydrogen production from BSG.
