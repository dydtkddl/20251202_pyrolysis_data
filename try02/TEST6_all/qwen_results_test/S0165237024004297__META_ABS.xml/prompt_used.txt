You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of the pyrolysis behavior of PC, ABS and PC/ABS Three types of plastics—polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and PC/ABS blend—were studied in this work. Kinetic analyses were performed using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) methods. The evolved volatiles during the pyrolysis of each material were analyzed, and the pyrolysis behavior was proposed using in-situ tools such as thermogravimetric analyzer-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (TG-FTIR) and gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection (Py-GC/MS). The three samples were also pyrolysed in a fixed bed reactor to elucidate the impact of secondary reaction. For PC, the activation energy increases as the reaction progresses. PC primarily generated CO2 and oxygenated compounds. For ABS, the activation energy experienced a slight decrease once the depolymerization reaction initiates, while a reversed trend can be observed at higher conversion rates. ABS pyrolysis mainly produced nitrogen-containing compounds and mono-aromatics. In the case of PC/ABS blend, a distinctive two-stage decomposition mechanism was observed. The interaction between PC and ABS in the blend promoted the formation of N/O-containing compounds. Additionally, this interaction enhanced the production of lighter phenols at the expense of bisphenol A, while ABS was not affected markedly. Stronger re-condensation and cracking reactions in the fixed bed system, facilitated the formation of poly-aromatics and lighter phenols (p-cresol and 4-ethylphenol) at the expense of bisphenol A during the pyrolysis of PC. In contrast, styrene from ABS decomposition was weakly affected by the secondary reaction. The intensified secondary reactions occurring the sample bed of the fixed bed experiments can also enhance the interaction between volatiles from ABS and PC, forming more heterocyclic N-compounds.
