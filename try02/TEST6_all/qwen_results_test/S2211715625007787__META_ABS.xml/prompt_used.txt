You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A greener approach: microwave-assisted synthesis of nickel selenides anchored on hollow carbon spheres for hydrogen production in alkaline solutions A rapid, microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was used to synthesize four distinct nickel selenide phases (NiSe, NiSe2, Ni3Se2, and Ni3Se4) and their composites with HCSs for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HCSs/NixSey composites exhibited significantly improved HER performance compared to pure nickel selenides, with overpotentials of 211 mV (HCSs/NiSe), 267 mV (HCSs/NiSe2), 242 mV (HCSs/Ni3Se2), and 280 mV (HCSs/Ni3Se4) at −10 mA/cm2. These composites also demonstrated higher electrochemical active surface areas such as 120 cm2 for HCSs/Ni3Se4 vs. 57.5 cm2 for pure Ni3Se4, lower Tafel slopes (41–61 mV/dec), and reduced charge-transfer resistance (61 Ω for HCSs/NiSe vs. 123 Ω for pure NiSe). The enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic interaction between NixSey and the conductive-defect-rich HCSs, which facilitated electron transport, exposed active sites, and modulated interfacial electronic structure. This green synthesis approach supports sustainable hydrogen production and aligns with SDGs 7 and 13.
