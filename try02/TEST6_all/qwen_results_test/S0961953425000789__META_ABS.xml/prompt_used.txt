You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilizing luffa sponge-derived porous activated carbon as a sustainable environmental bio-mass for renewable energy storage applications The advancement of sustainable technologies for producing green energy sources is essential, especially for energy storage and conversion methods that preserve ecosystems. A promising approach involves using low-cost, eco-friendly activated carbon derived from bio-waste materials, such as luffa sponge, for energy storage applications. This study details the preparation of activated carbon (LSAC) derived from luffa sponge through hydrothermal treatment followed by KOH activation at 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C to optimize its properties. The biomass-derived carbon structural and morphological properties are analyzed, and these materials are used as electrodes to assess their electrochemical characteristics. According to cyclic voltammetry tests, LSAC-8 demonstrates a specific capacitance of 411.63 F g⁻1 at a current density of 1 A g⁻1, exhibiting much lower electrochemical impedance than the other samples. LSAC-8 also demonstrates low internal resistance (1.25 Ω) and superb cycling stability over 2000 cycles, enhancing the electrochemical performance of biomass resources. Delivering a high energy density of 24.88 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1230 W kg−1 in a PVA/KOH electrolyte, the LSAC-8-based symmetric supercapacitor demonstrates substantial commercial potential for high-efficiency supercapacitor technologies.
