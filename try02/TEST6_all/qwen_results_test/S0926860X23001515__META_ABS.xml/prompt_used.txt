You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction on visible-light irradiated W-doped alkali niobate-based perovskite The photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction was studied under visible-light irradiated W-doped niobate-based perovskites. Nanostructured K0.5Na0.5(WxNb1−x)O3 materials were prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis as a function of 1 – 3 mol% W6+ cations within the host structure. A careful characterization of solids including morphology, structure, texture, optical, and electrochemical properties was performed. From the characterization analysis it can be concluded the materials are constituted by nanostructured mesoporous hollow spheres and the substitution of Nb by W leads to the distortion of NbO6 octahedra. The photoelectrocatalytic activity was correlated with the structural properties and electrochemical properties of materials. To the best of our knowledge, the present W-doped niobate-based perovskites showed the highest turnover frequency reported in the photoelectrocatalytic OER under similar overpotential conditions. Accordingly, this new class of perovskite-based crystalline materials opens a door for the scaling-up of catalytic and photocatalytic processes related to energy production.
