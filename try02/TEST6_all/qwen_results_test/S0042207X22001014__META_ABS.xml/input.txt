The comprehensive study of thermal properties of tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)cobalt(III) related to the chemical vapor deposition of Co-oxide based thin film materials Using a flow technique, the temperature dependences of saturated vapor pressure of two crystalline modifications of tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)cobalt(III) – Co(thd)3: stable (P‾3c1) and metastable (Pnma) have been firstly determined. The temperature dependences of saturated vapor pressure of two crystalline modifications of tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)cobalt(III) – Co(thd)3: stable (P‾3c1) and metastable (Pnma) have been firstly determined using a flow technique. The onset temperatures of thermolysis and decomposition ways of Co(thd)3 vapors in vacuum and in the oxygen and hydrogen presence were established by a means of in situ mass spectrometry. The Co-oxide based materials were obtained via deposition of metastable phase of Co(thd)3 by Pulse-CVD on Si(100) substrates. The composition and microstructure of Co-oxide based materials depending on deposition temperature and career gas was studied by using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron, Raman spectroscopy and SEM. The (111)-oriented Co3O4 film demonstrates electrochemical stability in 1 M NaOH solution and it has 0.63 V potential which is reached at 10 mA/cm2.
