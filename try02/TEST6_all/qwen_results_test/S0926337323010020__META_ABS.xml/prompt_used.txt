You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic upgrading of a model polyethylene pyrolysis oil by hydroconversion over Ni-containing hierarchical Beta zeolites with tailored acidity Valorization of waste polyolefins by a sequential combination of thermal pyrolysis and catalytic hydroconversion over a bifunctional metal/acid catalyst (e.g. zeolite) is an efficient route to produce transportation fuels. However, the zeolite strong acidity typically causes extensive cracking and loss of liquid fuels. In this work, mild dealumination with oxalic acid of a hierarchical Beta zeolite was used to achieve Ni 7%/h-Beta catalysts with Si/Al ratios within the 25 – 130 range. These catalysts were tested in the hydroconversion of a model mixture of LDPE thermal pyrolysis product (1-dodecene/n-dodecane, 50/50 w/w). The highest share of liquid fuels (∼ 90%) was achieved over 7% Ni/h-Beta (SiAl = 130). Besides, due to its high accessibility and tailored acidity, the product contained a meaningful amount of isoparaffins (12%) and a negligible content of olefins (< 3.5%). Thus, this catalyst holds promise for plastic waste hydroconversion towards transportation fuels.
