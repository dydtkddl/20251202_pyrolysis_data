Novel catalyst development from waste tire pyrolysis carbon black for efficient hydrogen-rich syngas generation via polypropylene catalytic pyrolysis Waste plastics pose significant environmental challenges due to their persistent nature and resistance to degradation. Pyrolysis, as a promising chemical treatment technology, has garnered considerable attention for its dual potential in mitigating pollution and recovering high-value energy and chemical products. In this study, a novel Ni/purified carbon black catalyst was synthesized by impregnating active nickel metal onto a purified carbon black support. This catalyst was employed to facilitate the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) in the presence of water vapor, aiming to produce hydrogen-rich syngas while simultaneously achieving the valorization of purified carbon black. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were comprehensively characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, elemental analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) both before and after the reaction. Furthermore, the effects of varying nickel loading ratios on the gas yield and composition during the catalytic reforming of polypropylene were systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that nickel predominantly exists in its elemental form when supported on purified carbon black. Increasing the nickel loading ratio led to a corresponding enhancement in the specific surface area of the catalyst, which in turn significantly improved the production of hydrogen-rich syngas. Under optimal conditions with a nickel loading ratio of 15 % and a catalyst dosage of 1.2 g, the hydrogen yield reached 54.85 mmol/gPP, with a hydrogen concentration of 48.05 %. Additionally, the combined proportion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) in the syngas accounted for 60.23 %, highlighting the catalyst's high efficiency in syngas production.
