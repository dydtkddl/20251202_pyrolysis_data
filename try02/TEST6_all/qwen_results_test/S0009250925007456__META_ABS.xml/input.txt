Random scission kinetic model for polymer degradation: A case study of polyamide-6 hydrolysis in subcritical water This study investigated the non-catalytic hydrolysis of polyamide-6 (PA6) in subcritical water (Sub-CW) and developed reaction kinetic model based on random chain scission. Molecular dynamics simulations and product characterization reveal that PA6 hydrolysis in Sub-CW occurs not only at the interface but also within the molten PA6. The temporal evolution of the degree of polymerization (DP) distribution of unreacted polymer, governed by random scission, is quantitatively described using a synergistic approach incorporating binomial scission probabilities and Monte Carlo simulations. Parameter estimation based on experimental data indicates that the activation energy for water attacking amide bond scission is 130 kJ/mol, while the cyclodehydration of 6-aminohexanoic acid to ε-caprolactam exhibits a reaction enthalpy of 14 kJ/mol. A notable feature of polymer degradation governed by the random scission model is the sharp decline in degradation efficiency as DP decreases, with the majority of reaction time devoted to the conversion of oligomers into monomers.
