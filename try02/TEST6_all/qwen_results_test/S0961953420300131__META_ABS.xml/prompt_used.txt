You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on hydrothermal carbonization of biomass and plastic wastes to energy products Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) as a promising thermochemical process can convert organic solid wastes (e.g., biomass, plastics) into valuable products (i.e., hydrochar) at relatively low temperatures (180–250 °C) and saturated pressures (2–10 MPa). Hydrothermal conversion generally occurs via dehydration, polymerization and finally carbonization reactions. The carbon materials derived from hydrochar have high potential in various applications such as solid fuel, supercapacitor, fuel cell, and sorbent. Although the energy densification of hydrochar was increased at higher temperatures, most of the benefit was achieved at modest temperatures. Chemical structures of hydrochars include crosslinks of aromatic polymer, surface porosity, organic functional groups and ultimate components. All of these characteristics can be changed significantly by HTC, influencing the reactivity and fuel properties of hydrochars. The reaction pathways including negative and positive effects during (co)-HTC of biomass and plastic wastes are thoroughly concluded. In particular, the co-HTC of chlorinated plastic (e.g., PVC) and biomass can enhance the dechlorination and inorganics removal from hydrochar.
