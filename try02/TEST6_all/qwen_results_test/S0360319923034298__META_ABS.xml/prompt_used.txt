You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of hydrogen production via waste plastic gasification in a fluidized bed reactor using Aspen Plus Plastic waste-to-energy conversion via gasification is a promising method for hydrogen production. In this study, the effects of waste plastic type, equivalence ratio, operating temperature and pressure on the hydrogen production from waste plastics in a fluidized bed reactor were investigated. A precise model of the air gasification process of five different types of waste plastics was developed using modules available in Aspen Plus. Following the model validation, a parametric study was conducted by varying the temperature in the range of 600 °C–1200 °C, the equivalence ratio between 0.05 and 0.50, and the pressure between 1 bar and 50 bar. This study provides valuable information on the impact of different process parameters on the air gasification of various waste plastics which has not been reported extensively. The conversion behaviours of air gasification process for waste plastics were characterized based on syngas composition, syngas lower heating value, hydrogen yield and cold gas efficiency. The simulation results for hydrogen production, which ranged from 15.33 Nm3/ton feed to 284.40 Nm3/ton feed for all plastics, were found to be consistent with experimental results. As a result, the optimal conditions for achieving maximum hydrogen yield in the waste plastic gasification process have been determined and reported.
