Coupling property-optimized Ru/Beta catalysts with advanced open batch distillation reactors for waste polyethylene hydrocracking Plastic waste, particularly from polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE), poses an escalating environmental burden due to its chemical inertness and volume. Pyrolysis is commercialized process that offers a practical solution for recycling plastic waste, but it is limited by high temperature requirements, substantial energy consumption, and high proportion of olefinic products. Hydrocracking with bifunctional catalysts under optimized conditions presents a promising alternative. Here, we developed a property-optimized Ru/Beta catalyst system combined with a pressurized open batch distillation reactor for the selective hydrocracking of waste PE into C5–C30 hydrocarbons. Zeolite Beta supports with varied Si/Al ratios and crystal sizes were synthesized to control Brønsted acid site distribution and external surface area. The controlled properties influenced Ru nanoparticle dispersion, hydrogen activation, and overall catalytic activity. Nano-sized zeolite Beta supports exhibited the highest Ru dispersion and facilitated efficient hydrocracking. The open batch reactor configuration enabled real-time vapor-phase separation of volatile products, minimizing secondary cracking. Under optimized conditions (280 °C, 40 H2 bar), Ru/nanosized Beta with (Si/Al=10) achieved over an 80 % PE conversion and a 50 % selectivity toward C5–C30 liquid hydrocarbons. Product analysis using GC-FID, GPC, and ¹H NMR confirmed the formation of branched alkanes with a narrow molecular weight distribution in the C5–C15 range. This work underscores the critical role of metal–acid site balance, nanoscale catalyst engineering, and dynamic reactor operation in achieving selective and efficient polyolefin hydrocracking.
