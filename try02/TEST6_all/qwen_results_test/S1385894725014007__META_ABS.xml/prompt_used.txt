You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of microplastics degradation efficiency: Microbial laccase-driven radical chemical coupling catalysis Microplastics, with the complex structure and chemical characteristics, are developing into an environmental burden. Although independent biological solutions have warranted the logical degradation targets, challenges persist owing to inadequate decomposition. Herein, we elucidated biochemical evidence for the synergistic enhancement of polyethylene microplastics (MPEs) removal. This innovative scenario involved the rational design of biological manganese oxides and their derived cytogenic radicals in laccase cell-surface-display biotemplate centers. Kinetics, quenching, and characterization confirmed that the associative function of laccase and chemical free radicals (•OH-dominated) enhanced degradation, effectively supporting MPEs removal (91.2 % at 37 °C and 52.4 % at 15 °C within 192 h) and making MPEs property changes towards the favorable direction for decomposition, including a ∼ 12 % reduction in particle size, an increase in surface negative charge to −3.40 mV, and a ∼ 37.5 % decrease in crystallinity. Product identification evidenced that MPEs chain structure was broken down into smaller molecules such as aromatics, aliphatics, alcohols, and esters. Based on pathway analysis, the coupled catalysis followed a microbial laccase-driven radical generation reaction, facilitated by electron transfer-based dynamic cycles (Mn(II)–Mn(III)–Mn(IV)). Furthermore, this approach showcased a catalytic preference for microplastic containing hydrocarbons and –CONH– bonds, demonstrating a promising catalysis strategy. We anticipate that this study will advance biological control of free radical behavior and the potential applications of key degrading-enzymes to complement existing degradation scales, underlining more new insights into microplastic removal.
