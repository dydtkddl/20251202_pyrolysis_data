Enhancement of microplastics degradation efficiency: Microbial laccase-driven radical chemical coupling catalysis Microplastics, with the complex structure and chemical characteristics, are developing into an environmental burden. Although independent biological solutions have warranted the logical degradation targets, challenges persist owing to inadequate decomposition. Herein, we elucidated biochemical evidence for the synergistic enhancement of polyethylene microplastics (MPEs) removal. This innovative scenario involved the rational design of biological manganese oxides and their derived cytogenic radicals in laccase cell-surface-display biotemplate centers. Kinetics, quenching, and characterization confirmed that the associative function of laccase and chemical free radicals (•OH-dominated) enhanced degradation, effectively supporting MPEs removal (91.2 % at 37 °C and 52.4 % at 15 °C within 192 h) and making MPEs property changes towards the favorable direction for decomposition, including a ∼ 12 % reduction in particle size, an increase in surface negative charge to −3.40 mV, and a ∼ 37.5 % decrease in crystallinity. Product identification evidenced that MPEs chain structure was broken down into smaller molecules such as aromatics, aliphatics, alcohols, and esters. Based on pathway analysis, the coupled catalysis followed a microbial laccase-driven radical generation reaction, facilitated by electron transfer-based dynamic cycles (Mn(II)–Mn(III)–Mn(IV)). Furthermore, this approach showcased a catalytic preference for microplastic containing hydrocarbons and –CONH– bonds, demonstrating a promising catalysis strategy. We anticipate that this study will advance biological control of free radical behavior and the potential applications of key degrading-enzymes to complement existing degradation scales, underlining more new insights into microplastic removal.
