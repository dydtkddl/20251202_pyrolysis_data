You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Migration characteristics of chlorine during pyrolysis of municipal solid waste pellets The migration process of chlorine during municipal solid waste (MSW) pellets pyrolysis was studied in a fixed bed reactor. Distribution and speciation changes of chlorine at different pyrolysis temperatures were determined by ion chromatography (IC) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Results showed that chlorine was mainly distributed in pyrolysis char (42.36–65.29 %) and gas (26.66–35.03 %) after MSW pellets pyrolysis. With the temperature increasing, chlorine in char and tar was enriched due to the increase of chlorine release and the decrease of product yields, with chlorine concentration increasing to 3498 ppm and 1415 ppm at 800 °C, respectively. Results of chlorine forms analysis indicated that most of the organic-Cl in MSW was released into the volatiles during pyrolysis due to the dissociation of CCl. Inorganic-Cl became the dominant form of chlorine in char after pyrolysis, with the proportion increasing from 46.69 % (raw) to 61.22 % (500 °C), which also suggested that part of organic-Cl was converted into the inorganic-Cl. Notably, the proportions of inorganic-Cl decreased at >600 °C due to the migration of inorganic. In addition, the pyrolysis release behavior of chlorine was affected by the pore structure of char, which could be inhibited by the unprosperous pores in char, especially at low temperatures (<600 °C). These findings provided a reference for the chlorine regulation of MSW pyrolytic products.
