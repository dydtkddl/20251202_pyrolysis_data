Migration characteristics of chlorine during pyrolysis of municipal solid waste pellets The migration process of chlorine during municipal solid waste (MSW) pellets pyrolysis was studied in a fixed bed reactor. Distribution and speciation changes of chlorine at different pyrolysis temperatures were determined by ion chromatography (IC) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Results showed that chlorine was mainly distributed in pyrolysis char (42.36–65.29 %) and gas (26.66–35.03 %) after MSW pellets pyrolysis. With the temperature increasing, chlorine in char and tar was enriched due to the increase of chlorine release and the decrease of product yields, with chlorine concentration increasing to 3498 ppm and 1415 ppm at 800 °C, respectively. Results of chlorine forms analysis indicated that most of the organic-Cl in MSW was released into the volatiles during pyrolysis due to the dissociation of CCl. Inorganic-Cl became the dominant form of chlorine in char after pyrolysis, with the proportion increasing from 46.69 % (raw) to 61.22 % (500 °C), which also suggested that part of organic-Cl was converted into the inorganic-Cl. Notably, the proportions of inorganic-Cl decreased at >600 °C due to the migration of inorganic. In addition, the pyrolysis release behavior of chlorine was affected by the pore structure of char, which could be inhibited by the unprosperous pores in char, especially at low temperatures (<600 °C). These findings provided a reference for the chlorine regulation of MSW pyrolytic products.
