You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Determining the composition and microstructure of ethylene–propylene copolymers by pyrolysis–gas chromatography The average composition and detailed microstructure of copolymers of ethylene and propylene have been studied by pyrolysis–gas chromatography (Py–GC), using a statistical modeling approach to analyze the data. The trimer distribution obtained from Py–GC is used to infer monomer arrangement information, which is quantified in terms of a number-average sequence length for each monomer. These values are used to define the microstructure and to calculate the average composition. Compared with other available techniques, Py–GC provides a simple, quick and reliable approach to study the microstructure and composition of polyolefin copolymers. Details of this Py–GC method are discussed, including an examination of its advantages and disadvantages, and a summary of the qualitative and quantitative analysis aspects of this approach is presented. The combination of a statistical modeling approach with Py–GC to study copolymer composition and microstructure allows one to investigate the complex problem of monomer arrangement in copolymers using a widely available analytical technique. We expect that with further advances in separation technology, especially two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC), research of this type will be become increasingly accurate and reproducible in the near future.
