You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Converting multiple hydrophobic aromatic plastic monomers into a single water-soluble substrate to increase bioavailability for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates by bacteria using batch, fed batch and continuous cultivation We demonstrate the proof of concept of increasing the bioavailability of carbon substrates, derived from plastic waste, for their conversion to the biodegradable polymer polyhydroxyalkanoate [PHA] by bacteria and test various approaches to PHA accumulation through batch, fed batch and continuous culture. Styrene, ethylbenzene, and toluene are produced from the pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (Kaminsky, 2021; Miandad et al., 2017), but they are volatile and poorly soluble in water making them difficult to work with in aqueous fermentation systems. By chemically converting these aromatic compounds to benzoic acid, and subsequently to its sodium salt, we increased the solubility and reduced the volatility of the substrate supplied to Pseudomonas putida CA-3 to accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates. 1 L scale batch, fed batch, and continuous fermentations were carried out; the fed batch fermentation resulted in the maximum volumetric PHA productivity of 61.67 ± 7.34 mg L−1 h−1; while batch and continuous, at a dilution rate, d = 0.2 h−1, fermentations resulted in 13.30 ± 0.01 and 4.06 ± 0.01 mg L−1 h−1 of PHA respectively.
