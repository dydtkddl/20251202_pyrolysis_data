You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of waste composite plastics with waste FCC catalyst The recycling of multilayer packaging plastic films is becoming more important due to its large application. In this work, two composite plastics of PET/LDPE (Polyethylene Terephthalate/Low Density Polyethylene) and PA6/LDPE (Polyamide/Low Density Polyethylene) were catalytically pyrolysed in different heating modes with the assistance of a waste FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) catalyst. The effect of FCC catalyst on product distribution, oil compositions and heteroatom compounds (oxygen and nitrogen-containing species) in different heating modes were studied using GC-MS (Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer) and APPI FT-ICR MS (Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer). It was found that waste FCC catalyst can form more gas at the expense of wax and oils due to its acidity property. More alkane and aromatic can be formed in the presence of FCC catalyst. Relative to non-catalytic pyrolysis, more alkanes are formed due to the hydrogen transfer ability of the FCC catalyst. The concentration of oxygen in oil and wax can be lowered by FCC catalyst. However, the concentration of nitrogen in oil is increased due to the lower denitrification ability of FCC catalyst even though its partition into oils is decreased. The waste FCC catalyst can decrease the number of O-containing compounds in heavier parts of oils from the fast pyrolysis of PET/LDPE. The number of compounds in Ox class are increased due to the interaction between oxygen radicals from PA6 and LDPE for the catalytic pyrolysis of PA6/LDPE.
