You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanism and kinetics of microwave-enhanced disposal of Zn-bearing dust using petroleum coke Zn-bearing dust is a typical solid waste generated by steel mills. It contains heavy metals that pose significant environmental risks. Additionally, petroleum coke with high sulfur content, which is a byproduct of petroleum cracking and coking, has limited applications. In this study, we developed a more energy-efficient and sustainable technique for the integrated disposal of dust containing Zn and petroleum coke. The reduction characteristics and kinetics of petroleum coke reducing agents co-disposed with Zn-bearing dust in a microwave environment were investigated to extract Zn from the Zn-bearing dust. These findings indicated that petroleum coke effectively served as a reducing agent for metal oxides, enabling their reduction at low temperatures when microwave heating was used. The optimal roasting conditions were identified as a temperature of 1100 ℃, reaction time of 60 min, and C/O molar ratio of 1.2, with a metallization rate of 96.78 % and dezincification rate of 99.58 %. Kinetic experiments revealed that the reduction process could be divided into four parts, with the second and third stages being the primary reaction phases. The activation energies for these stages were determined to be 244.952 and 379.019 kJ·mol−1, respectively, using the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunosen (KAS) method. Additionally, the mechanism of each stage was analyzed using the Coats–Redfern method, which indicated that the second stage was best modeled as a 2-D diffusion process, whereas the third stage followed a 3-D diffusion process.
