You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in coated carbon nanotube-reinforced metal matrix composites: Challenges, techniques, and performance enhancement Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted considerable scholarly attention over the past few decades as reinforcement materials in metal matrix composites (MMCs). This increasing interest is mainly due to their unique structural characteristics and exceptional electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. However, weak interfacial bonding and agglomeration of CNTs significantly reduce their reinforcement efficiency. These issues can be solved by surface functionalization and coating techniques. The effectiveness of MMC applications is contingent upon successfully addressing and overcoming the associated challenges. This paper aims to explore the recent advances in coated CNT-reinforced MMCs to address these issues. The pros and cons of using various coating materials, including nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and metal oxides, for coated CNTs as reinforcement material are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Moreover, various coated CNT fabrication techniques such as physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, electrodeposition, and electroless deposition are illustrated along with their merits and demerits. Among these methods, electrodeposition has proven to be the most widely used coating technique. Research findings show that Ni-coated CNT/magnesium (Mg) composites and titanium dioxide (TiO2)-coated CNT/aluminum (Al) composites exhibit enhanced mechanical properties. On the contrary, silver-coated CNT/Cu composites exhibit superior electrical conductivity. The study emphasizes that selecting the appropriate coating metal depends primarily on the desired final properties of the composite. In addition, the paper highlights current challenges in the field and suggests potential future research avenues aimed at improving the performance of coated CNT-reinforced MMCs.
