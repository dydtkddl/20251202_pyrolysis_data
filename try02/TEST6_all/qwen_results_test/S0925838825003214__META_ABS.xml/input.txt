Contemporary advancements and prospective outlook on feasible lithium-ion batteries based on silicon anodes Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), recognized for the high energy density and long cycle life, have become a crucial part of global sustainability development and are the approved choice for electric vehicles. Although the specific capacity of graphite anodes limits the demand for lithium batteries in terms of high energy and power density, silicon-based anode materials have shown potential to become key materials for the next generation of high energy density LIBs with high safety, abundant resources, and low cost. We investigate various methods to improve the stability of silicon negative electrodes and recent developments in industrial applications. This research presents many methods to prevent the swelling of silicon nanoparticles, enhance material conductivity, and improve stability during cycling through innovative structural designs, the development of high-performance silicon-based composites, and the exploration of novel additives and binders. This paper discusses the potential future applications of silicon anode materials, including their integration into all-solid-state batteries and the enhancement of production efficiency. These methodologies establish the groundwork for the advancement of next-generation lithium battery technology and offer substantial support for the manufacture of high-energy-density and long-lifespan batteries.
