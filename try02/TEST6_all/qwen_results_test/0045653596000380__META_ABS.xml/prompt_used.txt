You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on the thermal oxidation of 1,3-hexachlorobutadiene at 500 – 1100° C Thermal degradation processes of 1,3-hexachlorobutadiene (C4Cl6) have been studied using a tubular flow reactor at 1 atm over the temperature range 500–1100°C for residence times of 2 seconds. Kinetic studies were performed with mixtures of 1000 ppmV of C4Cl6 in air. Overall Arrhenius parameters for the destruction of C4Cl6 were determined between 700 and 850°C. About 30 molecular halogenated products from C1 to C8 formed by pyrolysis or oxidation of 1,3-hexachlorobutadiene over the investigated temperature range were identified. Concentration profiles of major products ( CO2, Cl2, CO, COCl2, C2Cl4, CCl4) and some minor products (C3Cl4O, C4C14O, C6Cl6, C3Cl4 and C3Cl6) have been measured as a function of temperature. Phosgene is the major chlorinated intermediate product. Detection of some aromatics such as hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene show the importance of the molecular growth pathways in the thechemical mechanism. Reaction pathways of main products are proposed and corresponding reaction enthalpies are estimated.
