You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel insights into mass transfer-controlled radical-mediated co-pyrolysis of lignin with typical plastics Co-pyrolysis of lignin with representative waste plastics, including polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was investigated, focusing on radical-mediated reactions, with radical detection via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). During the co-pyrolysis of lignin with PP, favorable synergistic effects were observed, resulting in a significant 17 % enhancement in phenolic compound yields within the fixed-bed reactor, whereas the presence of other plastics led to exacerbated cross-linking carbonization in contrast. Furthermore, TOF-MS and FT-ICR-MS analyses corroborated that the bio-oil derived from lignin/PP exhibited a higher phenolic content and lower carbon number distribution. Additionally, the radical concentrations in bio-oil of lignin/PP were determined to be the lowest (1.07 × 1013 spins/µL), providing compelling evidence of the strong interaction between lignin and PP. Interestingly, EPR spectroscopy detected the resultant lowest spin concentrations (1.28 × 1019 spins/g) in lignin/PP char, in contrast to lignin in isolation or within other plastics, which strongly indicating that hydrogen-rich radicals originating from PP were responsible for inducing more effective quenching reactions with lignin intermediates. Moreover, the lignin/PP char demonstrated the highest carbon content (80.30 %) and the lowest ID/IG ratio (1.98), further affirming a highly effective interaction between lignin and PP. The perspective drawn from this study is that the abundant hydrogen source of PP can provide hydrogen-rich radicals to quench lignin intermediates and improve phenolic yield. This intriguing work provides a fresh perspective to evaluate the effect of plastic origin on lignin co-pyrolysis based on radical theory.
