Attrition behavior analysis of four oxygen carriers in the in-situ redox jet attrition reactor The anti-attrition properties of oxygen carriers (OCs) significantly impact the operation cost in chemical looping processes. A custom jet attrition reactor evaluates the attrition resistance of four OCs: ilmenite (Ilm-NO), CuFe bi-ore OC via hydroforming (CuFe-Hy), and two perovskites via spray drying and hydroforming (Per-SD and Per-Hy), through cold, hot, and redox attrition tests. The anti-attrition performance order across all tests is Ilm-NO > Per-Hy > CuFe-Hy > Per-SD. Post-testing characterizations are conducted, including particle size distributions of consumed particles and captured powders, structure properties, and compositional evolution. Oxygen carrier lifetimes are quantified based on the particle size distributions. Multiple stresses affecting oxygen carrier attrition exhibit antagonistic interactions rather than linear superposition. Element migration, particle expansion, and strength evolution of the tested oxygen carriers are observed. Particle density and crushing strength are highly related to the anti-attrition properties of oxygen carriers. This study develops an efficient method for evaluating OCs under the in-situ redox condition with a high-velocity jet, offering guidance for designing OCs with high attrition resistance and advancing the study of attrition mechanisms.
