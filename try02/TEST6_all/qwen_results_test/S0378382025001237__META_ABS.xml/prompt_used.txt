You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Attrition behavior analysis of four oxygen carriers in the in-situ redox jet attrition reactor The anti-attrition properties of oxygen carriers (OCs) significantly impact the operation cost in chemical looping processes. A custom jet attrition reactor evaluates the attrition resistance of four OCs: ilmenite (Ilm-NO), CuFe bi-ore OC via hydroforming (CuFe-Hy), and two perovskites via spray drying and hydroforming (Per-SD and Per-Hy), through cold, hot, and redox attrition tests. The anti-attrition performance order across all tests is Ilm-NO > Per-Hy > CuFe-Hy > Per-SD. Post-testing characterizations are conducted, including particle size distributions of consumed particles and captured powders, structure properties, and compositional evolution. Oxygen carrier lifetimes are quantified based on the particle size distributions. Multiple stresses affecting oxygen carrier attrition exhibit antagonistic interactions rather than linear superposition. Element migration, particle expansion, and strength evolution of the tested oxygen carriers are observed. Particle density and crushing strength are highly related to the anti-attrition properties of oxygen carriers. This study develops an efficient method for evaluating OCs under the in-situ redox condition with a high-velocity jet, offering guidance for designing OCs with high attrition resistance and advancing the study of attrition mechanisms.
