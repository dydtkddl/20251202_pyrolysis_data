You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co2+/PMS based sulfate-radical treatment for effective mineralization of spent ion exchange resin Sulfate radical advance oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have attracted a greater attention as a suitable alternative of the hydroxyl radical based advance oxidation process (HR-AOPs). In this study, for the first time we report liquid phase mineralization of nuclear grade cationic IRN-77 resin in Co2+/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) based SR-AOPs. After the dissolution of cationic IRN-77 resin, 30 volatile and 15 semi-volatile organic compounds were analyzed/detected using non-targeted GC-MS analysis. The optimal reaction parameters for the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (%) of IRN-77 resin were determined, and the initial pH, PMS dosage, and reaction temperature were found to be the most influential parameters for the resin degradation. We successfully achieved ∼90% COD removal (1000 mg/L; 1000 ppm) of dissolved spent resin for SR-AOPs by optimizing the reaction parameters as initial pH = 9, Co2+ = 4 mM (catalyst), PMS = 60 mM (as oxidant) at 60 °C temperature for 60 min reaction. The electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) spectra confirmed the presence of SO4 ∙- and OH ∙ as main reactive species in the Co2+/PMS resin system. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses were used for structural characterization of solid and liquid phase resin samples. We believe that this work will offer a robust approach for the effective treatment of spent resin generated from nuclear industry.
