You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

HDPE pyrolysis-steam reforming in a tandem spouted bed-fixed bed reactor for H2 production Steam pyrolysis (500°C) of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a conical spouted bed reactor followed by a steam reforming (700°C) in a fixed bed reactor (Ni commercial catalyst) has been carried out for obtaining a syngas stream rich in H2. The product yields obtained in the pyrolysis of HDPE using steam are very similar to the previous ones with N2 as fluidizing agent. A comparison of the results obtained here with those for gasification-reforming strategy reveals that tar and C2+ hydrocarbons are not fully reformed using the pyrolysis-reforming strategy. Besides, although a high H2 yield is obtained (81.5% the stoichiometric value), it is slightly lower than the yield obtained in gasification-reforming. Coke yield is high (4.43wt.%), which causes fixed bed blockage and hinders a correct flow of the volatiles through the bed. SEM, TEM and TPO results show that two types of coke are deposited on the catalyst, with amorphous coke prevailing in the pyrolysis-reforming strategy and filamentous coke in gasification-reforming.
