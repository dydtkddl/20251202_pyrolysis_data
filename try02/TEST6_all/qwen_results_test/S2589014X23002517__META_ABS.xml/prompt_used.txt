You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Peatland plants growth performance of valorized oil palm microfibers infiltrated in chitosan/NPK and chitosan/PMAA/NPK composite Oil palm biomass and chitosan are abundantly wasted in Indonesia without being valorized optimally for specific purposes. The biomass can be used as a precursor for acquiring microfibers and composite films useful for plants' growth media. In this study, four different types of oil palm microfibers, comprising activated carbon (AC), non-activated carbon (nAC), lignocellulose (LC), and crystalline cellulose (CC), were utilized as a filler for chitosan and chitosan/PMAA membranes of plants growth media Different composite and nanocomposite films showed different results in the tested parameters of paddy and jelutong plants. Nanochitosan/NPK/PMAA/AC 1 % and chitosan/NPK/AC 5 % gave the highest score for paddy germination percentage (100 % and 95 % at 5 days, respectively) and seedling survival (80 % and 90 %, respectively), whereas chitosan/NPK/CC and chitosan/NPK/PMAA/LC composites at all concentrations had the highest germination percentage at 21 days (97,92 %) but only chitosan/NPK/CC at all concentrations had the highest seedling survival rate (100 %). Highest attack of fungi was only found in paddy grown in chitosan composites reinforced with cellulose (0–50 %) and lignocellulose (5–35 %). Jelutung had the highest maximum growth potential in chitosan/NPK/PMMA/LC (97.92 %) and chitosan/NPK/LC (97.92 %) whereas paddy had that highest value in chitosan/NPK/nAC (100 %) and nanochitosan/NPK/PMAA/AC (100 %). Paddy germination time ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 days for all chitosan or nano chitosan-based media whereas jelutong germination time was between 9.62 and 13.13 days for all samples. The study also confirmed that there were varied total numbers of secondary roots for paddy (4.67–6.25) and jelutong (10.80–14.00). Both chitosan composite and chitosan nanocomposite filled with microfibres could be utilized as growth media and slow-release nutrient agents for growing paddy and jelutong in peatland, subsequently beneficial for the peatland restoration in Indonesia.
