Optimizing dispersion of torrefied spent coffee grounds for enhanced biochar-EVA composite properties through sodium percarbonate-assisted treatment This study aims to optimize biochar by combining 10 % sodium percarbonate with 90 % spent coffee grounds and torrefying at 300 °C for 30 min. Biochar enhances black color dispersion in a composite when blending the optimal biochar and ethylene vinyl acetate. The maximum carbon content of the optimal biochar is 59.97 %, exhibiting similar dispersion, packing density, pore size, and contact angle to carbon black. The optimal biochar’s specific surface area and total pore volume are 7.12 m2·g−1 and 0.0018 cm3·g−1, respectively, 2.9 times and 1.2 times that of untreated torrefied spent coffee grounds with SP treated. The mechanical properties of the composite, which is blended with 15 wt% of the optimal biochar to ethylene vinyl acetate through trade-off analysis, indicate a tensile strength and Young’s modulus of 1.03 MPa and 9.69 MPa, respectively. As the amount of blended optimal biochar increases, the tensile strength decreases while Young’s modulus increases. Compared with a composite blended with the same 15 wt% of carbon black, the tensile strength and Young’s modulus are 0.77 MPa and 9.55 MPa, respectively. In conclusion, the optimal biochar is a potential alternative material that could replace carbon black. This finding aligns with the developmental direction of achieving negative carbon emissions, promoting a circular economy and valorizing waste.
