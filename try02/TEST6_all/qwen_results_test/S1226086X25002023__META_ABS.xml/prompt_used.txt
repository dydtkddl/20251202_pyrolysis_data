You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing dispersion of torrefied spent coffee grounds for enhanced biochar-EVA composite properties through sodium percarbonate-assisted treatment This study aims to optimize biochar by combining 10 % sodium percarbonate with 90 % spent coffee grounds and torrefying at 300 °C for 30 min. Biochar enhances black color dispersion in a composite when blending the optimal biochar and ethylene vinyl acetate. The maximum carbon content of the optimal biochar is 59.97 %, exhibiting similar dispersion, packing density, pore size, and contact angle to carbon black. The optimal biochar’s specific surface area and total pore volume are 7.12 m2·g−1 and 0.0018 cm3·g−1, respectively, 2.9 times and 1.2 times that of untreated torrefied spent coffee grounds with SP treated. The mechanical properties of the composite, which is blended with 15 wt% of the optimal biochar to ethylene vinyl acetate through trade-off analysis, indicate a tensile strength and Young’s modulus of 1.03 MPa and 9.69 MPa, respectively. As the amount of blended optimal biochar increases, the tensile strength decreases while Young’s modulus increases. Compared with a composite blended with the same 15 wt% of carbon black, the tensile strength and Young’s modulus are 0.77 MPa and 9.55 MPa, respectively. In conclusion, the optimal biochar is a potential alternative material that could replace carbon black. This finding aligns with the developmental direction of achieving negative carbon emissions, promoting a circular economy and valorizing waste.
