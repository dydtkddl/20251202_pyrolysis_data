You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Consecutive coproduction of H2 and syngas from waste polyolefins derived pyrolysis gas via chemical looping cracking–gasification Upcycling waste plastics into H2 and syngas offers a sustainable strategy for mitigating their accumulation and addressing the global issue of plastic pollution. The deposition of coke during thermocatalytic reforming processes poses a significant challenge for efficient conversion. Here we report the consecutive coproduction of high-concentration H2 (up to 80.5 vol%) and hydrocarbon-free syngas with tunable H2/CO ratios of 1.1–4.8 via a stepwise chemical looping cracking–gasification (CLCG) process over equimolar NiFeAl catalyst. Optimal gas yields of 0.26 mol gcata –1 and 0.52 mol gcata –1 per redox cycle for H2 and syngas are obtained from the cracking and gasification reaction stages, respectively. The CLCG process is investigated at a reaction temperature range of 700–900 °C which significantly impacts the H2/syngas coproduction due to the promoted catalyst reduction and segregation of Ni and Fe phases. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the metal distribution in the reduced NiFeAl catalysts by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the reaction temperature is essential in tuning the catalyst structure and performance. This work demonstrates the viable coproduction of separate H2 and syngas streams via the CLCG process which is promising for the circular management of waste plastics.
