Flame retardancy of sustainable polylactic acid and polyhydroxybutyrate (PLA/PHB) blends Nowadays, development of new biobased/biodegradable polymers from biological resources is of great interest from a sustainability standpoint. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polylactic acid (PLA) are two biopolymers obtained from renewable resources. In this study, the flame-retardant effect of a newly developed flame retardant (FR) based on melamine in a PLA/PHB blend was studied. Several combinations containing this new FR combined with ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and sepiolite were introduced in a PLA/PHB blend. 20 wt% of FR were introduced into a matrix containing 75 wt% PLA and 25 wt% PHB blended with a microcompounder. According to pyrolysis combustion flow calorimeter (PCFC) analyses, all the FR formulations exhibited reduced flammability. The results revealed a considerable decrease in the peak of heat release rate (pHRR) by 33 % in the presence of the new FR while a reduction of about 60 % for combinations with APP and sepiolite. The new FR system significantly enhanced the fire behaviour of PLA/PHB blend. The work presents the first cone calorimeter analyses of PLA/PHB composites. The fire behaviour evolved from thin sample to a thick charring behaviour highlighted by an increase of the residue after cone calorimeter from 0 to 14.7 % with this FR system.
