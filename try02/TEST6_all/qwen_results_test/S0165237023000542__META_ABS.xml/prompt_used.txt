You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kendrick mass defect analysis-based data mining technique for trace components in polyolefins observed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) is utilized as an effective technique to characterize additives and degradation products of polyolefins. However, non-target analysis of trace components buried in complex chromatograms or mass spectra is a difficult task without prior information on sample composition. In this report, we propose a data mining method that extracts meaningful trace components by combining Py-GC/time-of-flight MS (Py-GC/TOFMS) and Kendrick mass defect (KMD) analysis. In our first demonstration, we characterized the additives in the polyethylene (PE) cap of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) beverage bottle using Py-GC/TOFMS. The summed mass spectrum, built by summing all the mass spectra over the entire range of the pyrogram, was converted to a two-dimensional KMD plot. Specific dots on the KMD plot at a distance from the dots relating to a series of hydrocarbon-derived fragment ions suggested the presence of additives. The types of additives could be identified by a library search for the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) derived from the corresponding mass of the specific dots. The second demonstration was related to the detection of oxidized products in polypropylene (PP) resin. A “Remainders of KM” (RKM) plot was able to highlight the presence of a series of fragment ions of trace PP pyrolysates with one and two oxygen atoms. Relative peak intensities of the ions containing oxygen atoms were useful as an oxidation index to evaluate the degree of degradation in the very early stages of degradation.
