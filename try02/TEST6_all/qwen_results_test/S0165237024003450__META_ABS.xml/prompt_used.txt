You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of polystyrene using low-cost natural catalysts: Production and characterisation of styrene-rich pyro-oils This work aims to study the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) in order to obtain a styrene-rich liquid appealing for re-polymerisation processes. The process was performed in a fixed-bed reactor using low-cost materials such as ilmenite, olivine, calcium oxide (CaO) and dolomite as catalysts at 600 ºC. A non-catalytic test with sand was also conducted for comparison purposes. The resulting pyro-oil yield was between 89 and 96 wt%, and consisted mainly of styrene monomer, styrene dimer and styrene trimer, as well as other light aromatic compounds depending on the catalyst used. Olivine and CaO were capable to increase the styrene monomer concentration in the pyro-oil by about 10–12 % compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis, reaching up to 74.5 and 71.4 wt%, respectively. Furthermore, these catalysts reduced the concentration of styrene dimer and styrene trimer in the pyro-oil, which could be useful for further re-polymerisation processes. However, the presence of polyaromatics (PAHs) in the pyro-oils obtained from ilmenite, olivine and CaO was also identified, and other families such as mono-aromatics, di-aromatics, BTX, and nitrogen heterocyclic compounds were also increased in all pyro-oils obtained with catalysts compared to those obtained by non-catalytic pyrolysis. In addition, several inorganic species in the pyro-oil were reduced by the addition of the catalysts. This effect was observed after the addition of olivine and CaO, especially in the reduction of S, Mg, Ca and Fe. These results clearly demonstrate the potential of pyrolysis to convert PS waste into valuable building blocks for the production of new plastics.
