You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in processes and technologies for production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 2,5-furandicarboylic acid from carbohydrates Sugar platform biorefinery has shown promise for production of value-added chemicals such as 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and 2,5-furandicarboylic acid (FDCA). FDCA is a monomeric platform used in manufacturing of polymers such as polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), which is a green replacement for petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Various routes have been developed for FDCA synthesis, in which the 5-HMF route has shown a great potential for commercialization. In this 5-HMF route, 5-HMF that is generated by catalytic dehydration of carbohydrates, is further oxidized selectively to produce FDCA over either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous solid acid catalysts are more advantageous owing to ease of recovery and reuse. Different types of reactors, batch or continuous-flow were employed in the HMF oxidation to produce FDCA, while continuous-flow reactors show more promise with respect to future upscaling for industrial applications as well as their effectiveness (owing to enhanced mass transfer and increased product yield). Continuous conversion of 5-HMF to FDCA was mostly carried out in fixed bed reactors using heterogeneous catalysts. FDCA was also produced electrochemically where anode and cathode electrodes act as catalysts facilitating the oxidation process. As a new development, crude 5-HMF generated from the dehydration of glucose was used as a feed for the oxidation reactor without any separation/purification, enabling direct conversion of glucose to FDCA. In addition, this work also provides a brief review on the most recent patents related to developing new processes, catalysts, and reactors for FDCA production, etc.
