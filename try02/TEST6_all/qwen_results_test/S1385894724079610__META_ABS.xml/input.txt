Recent advances in processes and technologies for production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 2,5-furandicarboylic acid from carbohydrates Sugar platform biorefinery has shown promise for production of value-added chemicals such as 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and 2,5-furandicarboylic acid (FDCA). FDCA is a monomeric platform used in manufacturing of polymers such as polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), which is a green replacement for petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Various routes have been developed for FDCA synthesis, in which the 5-HMF route has shown a great potential for commercialization. In this 5-HMF route, 5-HMF that is generated by catalytic dehydration of carbohydrates, is further oxidized selectively to produce FDCA over either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous solid acid catalysts are more advantageous owing to ease of recovery and reuse. Different types of reactors, batch or continuous-flow were employed in the HMF oxidation to produce FDCA, while continuous-flow reactors show more promise with respect to future upscaling for industrial applications as well as their effectiveness (owing to enhanced mass transfer and increased product yield). Continuous conversion of 5-HMF to FDCA was mostly carried out in fixed bed reactors using heterogeneous catalysts. FDCA was also produced electrochemically where anode and cathode electrodes act as catalysts facilitating the oxidation process. As a new development, crude 5-HMF generated from the dehydration of glucose was used as a feed for the oxidation reactor without any separation/purification, enabling direct conversion of glucose to FDCA. In addition, this work also provides a brief review on the most recent patents related to developing new processes, catalysts, and reactors for FDCA production, etc.
