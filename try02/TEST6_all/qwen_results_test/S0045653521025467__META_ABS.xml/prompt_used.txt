You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PMS activation by magnetic cobalt-N-doped carbon composite for ultra-efficient degradation of refractory organic pollutant: Mechanisms and identification of intermediates Refractory organic pollutant effluent has led to severe water pollution. In this study, magnetic Co–N-doped carbon hybrid catalysts (Co-NC-x) were fabricated using a facile cation exchange combined pyrolysis and self-reduction technique to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for rehabilitation of the water environment. Factors affecting the catalytic activity of the Co-NC-850 were comprehensively examined. 100% of RhB degradation efficiency within 20 min was achieved in the Co-NC-850/PMS system at the optimum conditions (C 0 = 80 mg L−1, catalyst loading 0.025 g L−1, PMS concentration 0.8 mM, native pH and 25 °C). The electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and competitive quenching tests demonstrated that a sulfate radical (SO4•-) and singlet oxygen (1O2) account for RhB degradation in the Co-NC-850/PMS system, and 1O2 contributed ~86.2% to RhB removal. The synergistic effect of Co0 nanoparticles (NPs) and NC on Co-NC-850 might induce a predominant non-radical route to trigger PMS activation for RhB degradation. Direct oxidation of O2•- by a hydroxyl radical (•OH) might be the crucial process for forming 1O2. Magnetic response and successive cycles verified that Co-NC-850 has superior separable performance and reusability. This innovative magnetic Co-NC-850 hybrid catalyst for PMS activation delivered vast potential for disintegration of refractory organic contaminants.
