You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Innovative biomass pyrolysis polygeneration coupling carbon capture and formic acid synthesis Polygeneration integrates various systems and processes to produce multiple energy and chemical products, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing efficiency while mitigating resource wastage and environmental pollution. Based on the polygeneration coupling biomass pyrolysis, carbon capture and formic acid synthesis technology, it not only enhances the added value and market competitiveness of biomass-derived products but also reduces reliance on carbon monoxide for the production of formic acid. This study proposes a biomass pyrolysis polygeneration system configuration that couples carbon capture and formic acid synthesis processes, and builds an integrated simulation model of the polygeneration system process flow in gPROMS. The simulation results indicate that the system can simultaneously produce electricity, hot water at 60 °C, bio-oil, formic acid, and liquid CO2. The system’s comprehensive energy utilization and exergy efficiency are 47.43 % and 34.54 % respectively. From an economic perspective, the system’s annual net income is 59.14 million RMB, and the investment recovery is 7.78 years. The system configuration and simulation model proposed in this paper can provide theoretical basis and model support for the development and application of biomass pyrolysis polygeneration technology.
