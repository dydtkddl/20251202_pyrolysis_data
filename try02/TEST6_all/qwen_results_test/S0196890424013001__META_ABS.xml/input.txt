Innovative biomass pyrolysis polygeneration coupling carbon capture and formic acid synthesis Polygeneration integrates various systems and processes to produce multiple energy and chemical products, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing efficiency while mitigating resource wastage and environmental pollution. Based on the polygeneration coupling biomass pyrolysis, carbon capture and formic acid synthesis technology, it not only enhances the added value and market competitiveness of biomass-derived products but also reduces reliance on carbon monoxide for the production of formic acid. This study proposes a biomass pyrolysis polygeneration system configuration that couples carbon capture and formic acid synthesis processes, and builds an integrated simulation model of the polygeneration system process flow in gPROMS. The simulation results indicate that the system can simultaneously produce electricity, hot water at 60 °C, bio-oil, formic acid, and liquid CO2. The system’s comprehensive energy utilization and exergy efficiency are 47.43 % and 34.54 % respectively. From an economic perspective, the system’s annual net income is 59.14 million RMB, and the investment recovery is 7.78 years. The system configuration and simulation model proposed in this paper can provide theoretical basis and model support for the development and application of biomass pyrolysis polygeneration technology.
