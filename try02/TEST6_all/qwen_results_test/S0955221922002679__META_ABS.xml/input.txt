Predicting the failure by slow crack growth of SiC-based multifilament tows: Batch-to-batch discrepancies as linked to fiber slack This work investigates the scale effect observed on slow crack growth parameters for SiC-based fibers (Nicalon® and Tyranno® ZMI) and how it can be affected by the variability from a batch of tow to another one. A 10% difference on the stress exponents (n t ) was numerically estimated using a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation. This effect is however marginal when compared to the lifetime scatter itself. This partly originates from the fiber slack in used tow specimen, assessed by tensile test completing the experimental work. The number of tensile tests to be performed is discussed. Specimen gauge length is an additional and significant source of discrepancies affecting the fiber alignment and subsequently the tow stress exponent.
