Isothermal co-pyrolysis of hazelnut shell and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene: The effect of temperature and composition on the amount of pyrolysis products Solid wastes compromise biomass and plastics in terms of energy recuperation. Pyrolysis is the promising process in thermochemical conversions. In this study, isothermal co-pyrolysis of hazelnut shell and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) mixtures was executed in hand made pyrolysis reactor. The effect of temperature and composition on liquid, solid and gas yields was clarified with descriptive charts. It can be definitely stated that there are interactions between components which are called synergistic effects. Temperature change and ratio of UHMWPE do not alter solid product yield significantly. Co-existence of hazelnut shell and UHMWPE renders gas products in expense of liquid at all temperature and composition conditions. Liquid products were collected separately as heavy and light liquid. Liquid fuel is preferred to gas and solid ones due to commercial reasons. Combustible heavy liquid increases synergistically with increasing UHMWPE ratio. Here, synergistically means it is higher than mathematical calculation. It was found that just at 515°C and 0.5:1.5 (hazelnut shell/UHMWPE) composition total liquid product is above the calculated values. Additionally, 1.0:1.0 composition again at the same temperature produces highest heavy liquid yield.
