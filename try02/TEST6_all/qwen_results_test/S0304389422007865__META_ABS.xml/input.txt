Formation behavior of PAHs during pyrolysis of waste tires Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation from the pyrolysis of waste tires is inevitable because of the complexity of tire formulations and the addition of certain chemicals. In this study, the formation behavior and distribution of PAHs in three-phases were investigated from waste tires under pyrolysis conditions. The influencing factors including the temperature, heating rate, holding time, particle size, catalyzer, and atmosphere, were systematically evaluated. The results showed that PAHs were mainly concentrated in pyrolysis oil (94.59–99.03%), followed by the gas phase (0.96–5.34%), and their content was very low in the solid phase (0.01–0.99%). A higher temperature and slower heating rate lead to partial PAHs decomposition, thus reducing their emissions. The overall formation of PAHs can be inhibited when pyrolyzing coarse-grained tire powder. Furthermore, the PAHs formation mechanisms in waste tires were determined through reaction molecular dynamics, electron paramagnetic resonance, and intermediate products. Tires were mainly decomposed into benzene series, *C2H3, and *CH3; therefore, it was determined that PAHs were formed by the joint action of the hydrogen abstraction, and vinyl radical addition and methyl addition cyclization mechanisms. Among them, low and middle-ring PAHs were formed more easily, particularly naphthalene. The generation of PAHs can be inhibited by reducing the concentration of hydrocarbons and monocyclic benzene series. Regarding the distribution law and generation pathways of PAHs, our results provide guidance for reducing PAHs formation and emissions.
