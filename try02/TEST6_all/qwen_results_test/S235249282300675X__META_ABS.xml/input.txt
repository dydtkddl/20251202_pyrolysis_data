Impact of borosilicate bioactive glass scaffold processing and reactivity on in-vitro dissolution properties In this study, bulk borosilicate glasses and 3D scaffolds (processed by the burn-off technique and by robocasting) were synthesized to investigate the impact of the manufacturing method, glass composition and preincubation time on in vitro dissolution and cell response. The studied compositions are based on commercial bioactive glass S53P4 (BonAlive) where 12.5% SiO2 has been replaced by B2O (labelled B12.5), and part of the CaO is replaced with MgO and SrO (labelled B12.5-Mg-Sr). First, the impact of the processing and glass composition, on the dissolution rate, was assessed. As expected, scaffolds were found to exhibit faster dissolution, due to the increased surface area, when compared to the bulk glass. Furthermore, the 3D printed scaffolds were found to dissolve faster than the burn-off scaffolds. Moreover, scaffolds made from B12.5-Mg-Sr glass composition exhibited slower ion release and precipitation of calcium phosphate (CaP) layer, when compared to B12.5, due to the stabilizing effect of Mg and Sr. Finally, dynamic condition produces lower ion releases that static condition and could be more optimal for in vitro cell growth. Secondly, in culture with murine MC3T3-E1 cells, it was shown that 3 days preincubation would be optimal to decrease the burst of ions that is known to lead to cell death. However, it was found that MC3T3-E1 survived and proliferated only in presence of B12.5-Mg-Sr scaffolds. Finally, it was shown that despite scaffolds having different porosities, they had no significant difference on human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) survival. This manuscript brings new information on 1) the impact of material design (porosity) and composition on dissolution kinetic sand reactivity, 2) the impact of static vs dynamic testing on in-vitro dissolution and 3) the impact of materials’ pre-incubation on cell behavior.
