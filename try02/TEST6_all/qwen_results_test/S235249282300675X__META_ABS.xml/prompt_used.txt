You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of borosilicate bioactive glass scaffold processing and reactivity on in-vitro dissolution properties In this study, bulk borosilicate glasses and 3D scaffolds (processed by the burn-off technique and by robocasting) were synthesized to investigate the impact of the manufacturing method, glass composition and preincubation time on in vitro dissolution and cell response. The studied compositions are based on commercial bioactive glass S53P4 (BonAlive) where 12.5% SiO2 has been replaced by B2O (labelled B12.5), and part of the CaO is replaced with MgO and SrO (labelled B12.5-Mg-Sr). First, the impact of the processing and glass composition, on the dissolution rate, was assessed. As expected, scaffolds were found to exhibit faster dissolution, due to the increased surface area, when compared to the bulk glass. Furthermore, the 3D printed scaffolds were found to dissolve faster than the burn-off scaffolds. Moreover, scaffolds made from B12.5-Mg-Sr glass composition exhibited slower ion release and precipitation of calcium phosphate (CaP) layer, when compared to B12.5, due to the stabilizing effect of Mg and Sr. Finally, dynamic condition produces lower ion releases that static condition and could be more optimal for in vitro cell growth. Secondly, in culture with murine MC3T3-E1 cells, it was shown that 3 days preincubation would be optimal to decrease the burst of ions that is known to lead to cell death. However, it was found that MC3T3-E1 survived and proliferated only in presence of B12.5-Mg-Sr scaffolds. Finally, it was shown that despite scaffolds having different porosities, they had no significant difference on human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) survival. This manuscript brings new information on 1) the impact of material design (porosity) and composition on dissolution kinetic sand reactivity, 2) the impact of static vs dynamic testing on in-vitro dissolution and 3) the impact of materials’ pre-incubation on cell behavior.
