You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of biofuel quality via conventional and catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo with polystyrene in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor: Coupled experiments and artificial neural network modeling Experiments and artificial neural network modeling were performed to investigate the effect of operating parameters (temperature, fluidization velocity, and particle size) and catalysts (HZSM-5, red mud, Fe2O3, and dolomite) on co-pyrolysis of bamboo with polystyrene (PS) in a fluidized bed reactor for upgrading bio-oil. The synergistic effect was revealed by analyzing products via various analytical techniques and differences between theoretical and actual co-pyrolysis results. Under the H2-donor source from PS, co-pyrolysis reduced the O content while enhancing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons and higher heating value (HHV) of oil. Depending on the type of catalyst, characteristics and yield of the co-pyrolysis oil were affected along with the proposed reaction pathways. Dolomite was assessed as the most effective catalyst for improving oil quality, with the highest HHV (34.1 MJ/kg) and highest pH value (5.0). An artificial neural network using a back propagation algorithm in Matlab software was applied to predict the liquid yield and HHV of oil. The ANN15 model (15 neurons in the hidden layer) was found to be the best model in validating experimental data with mean deviations of 1.75 % for liquid yield and 0.87 % for HHV of oil.
