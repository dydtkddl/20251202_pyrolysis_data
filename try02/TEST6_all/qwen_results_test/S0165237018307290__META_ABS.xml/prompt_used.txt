You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of analytical fast pyrolysis vapors of medium-density fiberboard (mdf) using metal-modified HZSM-5 The high total worldwide production of MDF residues represents a concern due to its low value applications, disposal, and toxic potential. Catalytic and thermal fast pyrolyses of MDF wastes were studied using analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS. HZSM-5S impregnated with 5 metals were synthesized, characterized and designated as Co5S, Fe5S, Nb5S, Ni5S and Zn5S. All catalysts improved the percentage of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAH, 23.77–47.61%) and of PAH (0.66–5.07%), while they were not detected in thermal pyrolyses of the 4 MDF residues. Among catalysts, Ni5S improved the selectivity of BTX compared to HZSM-5S (26.22–37.90%), followed by Fe5S (31.40%). Performance of Co5S and Nb5S was similar to HZSM-5S, while Zn5S provided a lower MAH content (23.77%). The increase in hydrocarbons turned bio-oil into a product that more closely resembles fuel composition, while thermal pyrolyses provided mainly oxygenated compounds that can be used in other uses.
