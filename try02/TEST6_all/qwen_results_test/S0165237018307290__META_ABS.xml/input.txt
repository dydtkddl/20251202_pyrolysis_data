Characterization of analytical fast pyrolysis vapors of medium-density fiberboard (mdf) using metal-modified HZSM-5 The high total worldwide production of MDF residues represents a concern due to its low value applications, disposal, and toxic potential. Catalytic and thermal fast pyrolyses of MDF wastes were studied using analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS. HZSM-5S impregnated with 5 metals were synthesized, characterized and designated as Co5S, Fe5S, Nb5S, Ni5S and Zn5S. All catalysts improved the percentage of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAH, 23.77–47.61%) and of PAH (0.66–5.07%), while they were not detected in thermal pyrolyses of the 4 MDF residues. Among catalysts, Ni5S improved the selectivity of BTX compared to HZSM-5S (26.22–37.90%), followed by Fe5S (31.40%). Performance of Co5S and Nb5S was similar to HZSM-5S, while Zn5S provided a lower MAH content (23.77%). The increase in hydrocarbons turned bio-oil into a product that more closely resembles fuel composition, while thermal pyrolyses provided mainly oxygenated compounds that can be used in other uses.
