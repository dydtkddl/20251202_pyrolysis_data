Green synthesis of carbon quantum dots from biomass: A sustainable approach to nanotechnology Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) derived from biomass have appeared as sustainable nanomaterials due to their environmentally friendly synthesis approaches, tunable photoluminescence, and intrinsic biocompatibility. Synthesized routes of biomass CQDs align with green chemistry that includes hydrothermal treatment, microwave irradiation, pyrolysis, and ultrasonication treatment. Surface functionalization further modifies their physicochemical properties, expanding their potential to be applicable in different areas such as detection of environment pollutants, energy harvesting and storage, and biomedical applications. Therefore, biomass derived CQDs demonstrating their significance in next-generation sustainable materials science. Moreover, their low-cost production from abundant renewable resources provides industrial scalability, and current research is predictable to boost their incorporation into high-performance nanotechnology-based applications while contributing to global sustainability goals.
