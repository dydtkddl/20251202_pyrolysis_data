Study of the fuel properties of extracted oils obtained from low and linear low density polyethylene pyrolysis The study focusses on using virgin grades of low and linear low density polyethylene for pyrolysis route of fuel production, in order to mimic the most common municipal plastic waste components as a desirable feedstock with the future aim of integration plans to petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. The oil produced was assessed for basic properties of fuels and insights are provided as to fuel range of common fossil fuel types that it can replace. Effect of reactor temperature and oil yield characteristics was studied and the maximum oil yield (27%) was obtained at 600 °C while higher temperatures (700 and 800 °C) increased the diesel fraction in the pyrolysis oil. It is found that the diesel range hydrocarbons were the most abundant with the highest total sum for samples extracted from low density polyethylene pyrolysis oil. The oil produced is highly desirable and applicable as a fuel with a cetane number of 84. The oils in this work has low aromatic content likely retained by the thermal cracking process in the gaseous product fraction. The flash point measured for the oil samples (80 °C) agree with market standards for diesel fuel. The pour point, however, was slightly higher (10 °C) still making it suitable to be used a diesel.
