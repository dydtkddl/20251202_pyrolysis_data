You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced oil dehalogenation during catalytic pyrolysis of WEEE-derived plastics over Fe- and Ca-modified zeolites Pyrolysis affords the conversion of plastics from Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) into oils with potential applications in the production of valuable chemicals and the formulation of liquid fuels. However, the presence of significant concentrations of halogens (Cl and Br) in these wastes represents an important limitation as it can lead to the generation of hazardous species that negatively affect the environment. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of a real WEEE plastic has been investigated using a reaction system that operates with continuous feeding of the raw material. The catalysts assayed include bulk metal oxides (Fe2O3 and CaO) and zeolites (ZSM-5 and USY), as well as hybrid solids obtained by supporting those metal oxides on the zeolites. Pre-treatment of the raw WEEE plastics by water washing allows the Cl concentration to be significantly reduced, but it does not affect the Br content. Thermal pyrolysis produces an oil fraction with a high yield (> 70 wt%) and a large concentration of halogens (700 ppm), even though the char produced effectively retains more than 90% of Br and Cl contained in the feedstock. During catalytic pyrolysis, the halogen content of the oil is further reduced obtaining the best dehalogenation results with the metal-modified zeolites. This fact evidences a synergetic effect derived from the high metal dispersion achieved over the zeolitic supports. Fe/ZSM-5 is the most promising catalyst, showing an almost constant dehalogenation activity along the time-on-stream and producing an oil enriched in monoaromatic hydrocarbons (mainly styrene).
