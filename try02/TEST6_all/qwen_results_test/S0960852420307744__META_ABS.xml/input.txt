Co-pyrolysis of microalgae with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) for deoxygenation and denitrification To upgrade the algae pyrolytic oil, the influence of algae components on co-pyrolysis with LDPE were studied, with Spirulina platensis (SP), Nannochloropsis sp. (NS) and Enteromorpha Prolifera (EP) as typical algae samples, as they are enriched with proteins, lipids and carbohydrate, respectively, especially, the N and O transformation behavior during the co-pyrolysis was studied in depth. During co-pyrolysis, the interaction on products depended on the components of algae. EP and SP were prior to form CO2, rather than CO. For pyrolytic oil, co-pyrolysis effectively inhibited the formation of N- and O-compounds, but promoted the generation of long-chain alcohol and formic/acetic ester. And the obvious decrease of N and O content in co-pyrolytic oil was observed. However, the rich lipids in NS resulted in the improvement of N yield in pyrolytic oil during co-pyrolysis.
