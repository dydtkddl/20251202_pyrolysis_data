You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive analysis of a compact-sized methanol cracking unit for hydrogen production Methanol is recognized as source of hydrogen production, making it a suitable fuel for sustainable development. However, hydrogen production methods remain a concern. An experimental setup and a simulation model in Aspen Plus, incorporating an evaporator and cracker, are developed for hydrogen production. The effects of dimensional parameters, including the length and diameter of the cracker, temperature, and pressure in the presence of the catalyst SCST- 403, on hydrogen production and methanol conversion via thermal catalytic cracking have not been discussed yet . The experimental results show that the optimum hydrogen mole fraction exceeds 0.52, and methanol conversion exceeds 60% at a length of 2.83 m, diameter of 4.07 mm, temperature of 500 °C, and pressure of 2.7 MPa. The investigation is extended to redesign the cracker unit using Aspen Plus based on reaction kinetics. Simulations on various dimensions, temperatures, and pressures reveal that, after redesigning, the optimum hydrogen mole fraction exceeds 0.60, and methanol conversion reaches 85% at a length of 4.5 m, diameter of 5.2 mm, temperature of 500 °C, and pressure of 3 MPa.
