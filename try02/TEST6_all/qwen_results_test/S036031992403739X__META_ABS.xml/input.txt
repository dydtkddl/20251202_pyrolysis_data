A comprehensive analysis of a compact-sized methanol cracking unit for hydrogen production Methanol is recognized as source of hydrogen production, making it a suitable fuel for sustainable development. However, hydrogen production methods remain a concern. An experimental setup and a simulation model in Aspen Plus, incorporating an evaporator and cracker, are developed for hydrogen production. The effects of dimensional parameters, including the length and diameter of the cracker, temperature, and pressure in the presence of the catalyst SCST- 403, on hydrogen production and methanol conversion via thermal catalytic cracking have not been discussed yet . The experimental results show that the optimum hydrogen mole fraction exceeds 0.52, and methanol conversion exceeds 60% at a length of 2.83 m, diameter of 4.07 mm, temperature of 500 °C, and pressure of 2.7 MPa. The investigation is extended to redesign the cracker unit using Aspen Plus based on reaction kinetics. Simulations on various dimensions, temperatures, and pressures reveal that, after redesigning, the optimum hydrogen mole fraction exceeds 0.60, and methanol conversion reaches 85% at a length of 4.5 m, diameter of 5.2 mm, temperature of 500 °C, and pressure of 3 MPa.
