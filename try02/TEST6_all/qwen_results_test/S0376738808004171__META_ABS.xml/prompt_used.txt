You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of pyrolysis temperature and operating temperature on the performance of nanoporous carbon membranes Technology designed to capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) will play a significant role in the near-term reduction of CO2 emissions and is considered necessary to slow global warming. Nanoporous carbon (NPC) membranes show promise as a new generation of gas separation membranes suitable for CO2 capture. We have made supported NPC membranes from polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) at various pyrolysis temperatures. Positron annihilation lifetime spectrometry (PALS) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) results indicate that the pore size decreases whilst the porosity increases with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The membrane performance results support these findings with a significant increase in permeance being seen with increasing pyrolysis temperature, which relates to the increase in porosity. Mixed gas performance measurements also show an increase in CH4 permeance as the operating temperature is increased from 35 to 200°C, which can be related to an increase in the rate of diffusion. However, the selectivity decreases with increasing operating temperature due to the smaller changes in the CO2 permeance. These smaller changes in CO2 permeance can be related to the stronger adsorption of this gas on the carbon surface at lower operating temperatures. Interestingly, regardless of the original pyrolysis temperature, the selectivity at higher operating temperatures is similar, whereas the permeance remains related to this pyrolysis temperature.
