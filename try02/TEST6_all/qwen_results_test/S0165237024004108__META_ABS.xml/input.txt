Catalytic co-pyrolysis and kinetic study of microalgae biomass with solid waste feedstock for sustainable biofuel production Microalgae, while promising biofuel production, pose challenges in pyrolysis due to elevated moisture and protein levels, resulting in suboptimal fuel properties. Catalytic co-pyrolysis offers promising possibilities for sustainable resource utilization and waste management, generating bio-oil. This review explores biofuel production from co-pyrolysis of microalgae biomass, and waste feedstock, investigating reactor design, catalyst impact, and reaction mechanisms. Also, the investigation encompasses both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects, aiming to unravel the underlying reaction mechanisms and rate laws governing these processes. The kinetic studies provided vital information, laying the groundwork for optimizing reactor design and improving process conditions. Reactor selection is crucial for efficient processes, optimizing heat and mass transfer. Catalysts, especially Cu/HZSM-5, Ni–Mg/ZSM-5, CaO and Ce, enhances bio-oil quality and yield by reducing nitrogenous and oxygenated compounds and promoting high-value aromatics hydrocarbons. In co-pyrolysis, synergistic effects enhance bio-oil quality through interactions between acid and base catalysts. HCl presence during PVC co-pyrolysis with microalgae alters chemical profiles, influencing chlorine distribution in biochar and bio-oil. This research emphasizes comprehending optimal reactor design, catalyst dynamics, and reaction pathways for achieving efficiency, yield enhancements, and reduced environmental impacts. These advancements open doors towards producing valuable biofuels and chemicals from various microalgae biomass and plastic waste sources thereby contributing towards sustainability & circular economy practices in waste management.
