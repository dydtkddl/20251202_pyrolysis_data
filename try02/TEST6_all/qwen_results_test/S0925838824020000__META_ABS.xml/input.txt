Review on tribocatalysis through harvesting friction energy for mechanically-driven dye decomposition Friction exists everywhere. Tribocatalytic dye decomposition represents a recent and promising technology for wastewater treatment, in which the ordinary phenomenon of mechanical friction in life is utilized to generate some positive and negative charges based on triboelectrification. These charges further react with the OH- and dissolved O2 in dye solution to produce active species with strong redox abilities, facilitating the decomposition of organic dye molecules. Recent studies have shown that tribocatalysis technology not only excels in dye degradation but also demonstrates promising application prospects in energy conversion, antibacterial activity, and nitrogen fixation. However, there are still few reviews on the types of materials used in tribocatalysis and the methods to enhance its performance. This review aims to comprehensively summarize tribocatalysis, analyzing current enhancement methods such as mixing carbon, doping with metal elements, surface engineering, composition modification, polarization treatments, the construction of heterogeneous structures, and introducing oxygen vacancies. This review provides the view on the development and application status of nanomaterial-based tribocatalysis in harvesting friction energy to mechanically decompoe dye, offering a potential technological pathway for practical wastewater treatment in the future.
