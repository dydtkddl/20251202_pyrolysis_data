You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The reuse of disposable COVID-19 surgical masks as a nitrogen-enrichment agent and structure promotor for a wild plant-derived sorbent In this work, disposable surgical face masks (SFMs) have been utilized as nitrogen (N)-doping agents for carbon (C) adsorbents through thermal carbonization using K2CO3 as activators. A readily available wild-plant biomass (Cyperus papyrus, CP) was chosen as the raw material for manufacturing the adsorbent. A “green-etching” process was employed to synthesize adsorbents with significant modifications and without using of any chemicals. As observed via characterization analysis, upon mixing SFMs with CP at a 1:1 weight ratio, there were considerable developments in the specific surface area (SBET = 830 m2/g) for both micro- (0.333 cm3/g) and mesopores (0.053 cm3/g) as well as diversified functional groups (e.g., amino and carbonyl) on the sorbent that was produced. This is a key for the adsorbent’s ability in order to remove a variety of pollutants from aqueous solutions. The heavy metal (Cr(VI)) ion adsorption capacity was used to identify the optimum adsorption parameters. Significantly lower amounts of Cr(VI) residues were achieved at a concentration of 2 mg/L from an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 30 mg/L by applying an SFM-modified sorbent dose of 10 g/L. The outcomes of this research could be advantageous for decision making in plastic waste management that surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.
