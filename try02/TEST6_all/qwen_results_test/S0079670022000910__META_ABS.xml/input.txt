Progress in polymer single-chain based hybrid nanoparticles Precise control of molecular hierarchical organization has endowed biological systems with unique functions, which inspires great efforts in the synthesis of artificial mimics. Polymeric single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) with tunable microstructure and composition and distinct compartmentalization features are regarded as an ideal platform for biomimetic architectures. SCNPs represent an intermediate state between polymer and colloidal matter and are constructed by intramolecular crosslinking of linear polymers with tailored composition and topology. The microstructure of the SCNPs is broadly tunable from individual particle, to tadpole-shaped and dimer by using the polymers with different sequential distribution. It is noted that cyclic polymers are regarded as specific SCNPs with well-defined number of knotting (crosslinking). Functional composite hybrids are derived whose head and chain parts are greatly enriched in composition and microstructure via selective growth of functional materials or post-modification. Synergistic effects can emerge through hybridization of functionalities of the colloidal nanoparticles and characteristics of the polymer chains. These hybrids are attractive for applications such as the fabrication of novel superstructures that mimic catalytic functionalities of enzymes. This review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis of SCNP based functional hybrid nanoparticles. Large-scale synthetic approaches of the hybrid nanoparticles are highlighted. The use of SCNP as platform for functional hybrid nanoparticles is subsequently illustrated by applications such as biomimetic catalysis, interfacial engineering and biomedicine.
