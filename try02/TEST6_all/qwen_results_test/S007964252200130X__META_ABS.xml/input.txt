Additive manufacturing of oxide-dispersion strengthened alloys: Materials, synthesis and manufacturing Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloys are characterized by nanoscale oxide particles homogeneously dispersed in a metallic matrix. They have been developed driven by technological applications such as gas turbines that require increased material strength and creep properties at elevated temperatures, as well as increased resistance to high-energy neutron atmospheres as needed in modern nuclear reactors. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers the possibility to sustainably shorten the conventional sinter-based process chain of ODS materials and is additionally capable of the direct production of complex components. This work aims to critically review the current state of additive manufacturing of ODS alloys, which is mainly based on singular studies and the deduction of influence factors. Challenges in production are emphasized such as the production of suitable powder materials and consolidation techniques including in-situ manufacturing techniques. A main emphasis of this review are process-related influences on the final ODS material and its microstructural features as well as mechanical performance. Different classes of ODS alloys are presented and discussed along with their fields of use. Current drawbacks of ODS alloys are highlighted, enabling a focused development required for the widespread application of this class of materials.
