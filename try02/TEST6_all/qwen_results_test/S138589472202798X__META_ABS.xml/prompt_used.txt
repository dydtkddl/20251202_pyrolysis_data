You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic lignin valorisation by depolymerisation, hydrogenation, demethylation and hydrodeoxygenation: Mechanism, chemical reaction kinetics and transport phenomena The lignin-to-chemicals valorisation has increased the interest of the scientific community in exploring the effective lignin depolymerisation. Lignin is the most abundant natural resource of aromatic components with a high potential to be converted into the various chemicals, thus increasing the level of an integrated biorefinery. This review focuses on lignin depolymerisation mechanism, chemical reaction kinetics and transport phenomena studies, recently introduced in the field of lignin chemistry to understand the reactivity of lignin macromolecule in two- or three-phase systems with a heterogeneous catalyst, liquid solvent and gaseous source. Lignin depolymerisation involves several parallel and sequential reactions of aryl-ether bond cleavage leading to a complex mixture of numerous depolymerised components. Theoretical and mathematical approaches for understanding and predicting catalytic parameters with the kinetic modelling are also discussed. The modelling approaches and kinetic data from various works in the literature has been thoroughly systematically reviewed, processed and consistently presented and benchmarked in graphical and tabular form. The aspects of modelling heat and mass transfer during lignin depolymerisation and upgrade has also been reported.
