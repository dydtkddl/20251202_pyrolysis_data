You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An innovative radial gradient material design using hot isostatic pressing for applications in extreme environments Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are highly advanced continuous or discontinuous structures whose structural and material properties vary along a singular geometric dimension either in the axial or radial direction. The radial gradient FGM design makes for an optimal structural design to incorporate a bi-metallic structure with a copper-based high entropy alloy (Cu-HEA) with good mechanical properties and high irradiation resistance, and Chromium (Cr) with great corrosion resistance. This study focuses on the experimental design of a metal powder loading mechanism to fabricate a bi-metallic radial gradient structure using Cu-HEA and 99.9 % pure Cr metal powders. The powder loading strategy uses custom-designed concentric cylindrical dividers to separate the individual compositions. Two benchtop trial runs were performed for design optimization. The optimized design was then implemented to eventually load the HEA and Cr powders for consolidation via powder metallurgy hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP). The electron microscopy analysis reveals the successful fabrication of the radial gradient structure with the chemical mapping analysis, demonstrating the gradual composition shift from the HEA at the center to the pure-Cr at the periphery via a three-step gradient.
