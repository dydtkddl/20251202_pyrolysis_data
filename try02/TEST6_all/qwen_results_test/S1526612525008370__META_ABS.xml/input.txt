An innovative radial gradient material design using hot isostatic pressing for applications in extreme environments Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are highly advanced continuous or discontinuous structures whose structural and material properties vary along a singular geometric dimension either in the axial or radial direction. The radial gradient FGM design makes for an optimal structural design to incorporate a bi-metallic structure with a copper-based high entropy alloy (Cu-HEA) with good mechanical properties and high irradiation resistance, and Chromium (Cr) with great corrosion resistance. This study focuses on the experimental design of a metal powder loading mechanism to fabricate a bi-metallic radial gradient structure using Cu-HEA and 99.9 % pure Cr metal powders. The powder loading strategy uses custom-designed concentric cylindrical dividers to separate the individual compositions. Two benchtop trial runs were performed for design optimization. The optimized design was then implemented to eventually load the HEA and Cr powders for consolidation via powder metallurgy hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP). The electron microscopy analysis reveals the successful fabrication of the radial gradient structure with the chemical mapping analysis, demonstrating the gradual composition shift from the HEA at the center to the pure-Cr at the periphery via a three-step gradient.
