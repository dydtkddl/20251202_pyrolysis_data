High-energy milling of iron ore into an efficient catalyst for cracking of methane and biogas This work presents the synthesis of an effective, low-cost iron catalyst for catalytic cracking of methane (CCM) and biogas (CCB) via high-energy ball milling (HEBM) of iron ore (75 wt % hematite). Milling times of 20, 60, and 120 min were tested to assess the effects on the ore's catalytic properties, with optimal conditions determined at 900 °C and 2 NL min−1 gcat −1. A 60-min milling duration significantly improved catalyst activity and stability, enhancing carbon yield in CCM by 23% compared to unmilled ore. The improvement was attributed to smaller Fe2O3 particles formed during extended milling. In CCM, nanostructured carbon with Fe–C hybrids and graphite encapsulation was observed, while carbon deposition was minimized in CCB due to gasification. This study underscores the potential of HEBM-processed iron ore as an efficient catalyst for methane and biogas cracking.
