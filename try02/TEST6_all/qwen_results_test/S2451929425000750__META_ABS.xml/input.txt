Harnessing plastic depolymerization products to upcycle mixed waste into high-value chemicals Plastic pollution is a pressing challenge, such that traditional recycling struggles to handle mixed waste. In the March issue of Chem Catalysis, Li et al. introduce a process that co-upcycles two societally important plastics, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyoxymethylene (POM), offering a solution for more complex waste streams.
