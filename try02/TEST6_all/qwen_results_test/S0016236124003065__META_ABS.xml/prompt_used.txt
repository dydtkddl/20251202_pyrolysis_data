You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing microbial fuel cells performance: An innovative approach integrating anode materials, dual-pollutant treatment, and long-term operation Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) generate energy and remove pollutants, making them environmentally friendly. Due to electrode and organic substrate material instability, MFCs have poor electron transport and generation. The viability of utilizing graphene derivative materials from Nipah palm frond (NPF) waste is examined, involving the synthesis of NPF-GO for coating GO-ME (graphene-mild-steel), GO-SE (graphene-stainless-steel), and GO-GE (graphene-graphite) anodes. Electricity generation patterns and performance are closely monitored over an operational period, with GO-ME (29.1 mW/m2) consistently outperforming GO-SE (26.5 mW/m2) and GO-GE (7.6 mW/m2). This work uniquely combines inorganic and organic dual cathodic-anodic pollutant treatment with energy generation, achieving remarkable bisphenol A (BPA) and lead (II) nitrate (Pb2+) removal. Over the 105-day operational period, BPA removal rates reached 98.03 % for the GO-ME anode, 96.95 % for the GO-GE, and 83.73 % for the GO-SE, while Pb2+ removal efficiency was above 98 % in all reactions. The biological characterizations indicates that each of the three electrodes performed well and smoothly and that several exoelectrogens, including Lysinibacillus sp., Bacillus sp., Providencia sp., and Mammaliicoccus sp., were found on each electrode. This study also uses nira sap as the organic substrate for this MFCs operation. This study also enclosed MFCs' operating mechanisms, compared prior results, and made future recommendations.
