Mechanistic insights into support-induced catalyst activity and deactivation pathways of Co-Ni-Mo catalyst during biomass pyrolysis-chemical vapor deposition process The effect of alumina and magnesia supports on the co-production of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and H2 via pyrolysis–chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process from a renewable biomass feedstock (wood chips) was investigated using trimetallic 20Co–20Ni–10Mo catalysts. Catalysts supported on 50 wt% Al2O3, 25 wt% Al2O3–25 wt% MgO, and 50 wt% MgO exhibited distinct MWCNTs growth kinetics, deactivation behaviors, and product yields. The Al2O3-supported catalyst showed the highest initial growth rate (r0 = 23.9 × 104 mol·min−1·g−1) and longest activity duration (t0 = 220 min), followed by Al2O3–MgO and MgO. Corresponding MWCNTs yields in a bench-scale setup were 6.98, 5.46, and 3.65 g/g-cat, respectively. The data suggests Al2O3 is more effective in MWCNTs synthesis from biomass-derived pyrolysis gas compared to MgO and Al2O3-MgO. The roles of metal-support interactions, acid-base properties, and reducibility on the catalyst activity are discussed. MWCNTs growth profiles fit well to a dual-site kinetic model (R2 > 0.90), while catalyst deactivation followed a two-phase model, capturing both rapid and gradual loss of activity. Importantly, this study establishes quantitative links between spent catalyst properties, such as crystallite size and metal particle size and kinetic parameters, thereby elucidating support-dependent deactivation mechanisms. The findings provide mechanistic insights into support-induced catalyst activity and deactivation pathways, offering a basis for the rational design of stable and high-performing catalysts for biomass-to-MWCNTs and hydrogen conversion.
