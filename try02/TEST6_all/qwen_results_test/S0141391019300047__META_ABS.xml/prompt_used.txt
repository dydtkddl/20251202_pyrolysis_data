You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and characterization of two new biobased poly(pentylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate-co-caprolactone) and poly(hexamethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate-co-caprolactone) copolyesters with enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis properties Herein, two fully renewable copolyester series, namely poly(pentylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate-co-caprolactone) (PPeCFs) and poly(hexamethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate-co-caprolactone) (PHeCFs) were successfully synthesized with combining ε-caprolactone (CL) with poly(pentylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PPeF) and poly(hexamethylene 2,5-furan dicarboxylate) (PHeF) with different molar ratios. These materials, with a CL content ranging from 10 to 50 mol%, were synthesized for first time using stannous octoate as catalyst via ring opening polymerization (ROP). Their chemical structures and molar composition were evaluated by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR spectroscopies, while their thermal properties were investigated in detail using Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The obtained results, in combination with Wide-Angle-X-ray diffractometry (WAXD), showed that copolymerization of CL with PHeF and PPeF led to semi-crystalline and partially amorphous copolyesters respectively, providing the basis for significant thermal properties enhancement with respect to the polycaprolactone (PCL) homopolymer, and therefore a much wider range of melting points (T m ) and glass transition temperatures (T g ) were obtained. TGA of the new copolymers showed excellent thermal stability, exceeding 310 °C and 360 °C for PHeCFs and PPeCFs respectively, while their decomposition mechanism was evaluated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS). Almost all copolyesters and mainly the ones with 40 and 50 mol% CL content showed accelerated enzymatic hydrolysis rate.
