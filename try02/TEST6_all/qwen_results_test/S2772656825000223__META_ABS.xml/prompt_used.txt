You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-catalytic gasification of plastic waste for hydrogen-rich syngas production with hybrid-functional Ni-CaOCa2SiO4 catalyst The production of H2-rich syngas from pyrolysis-catalytic gasification of plastic waste bottles has been investigated. The hybrid-functional materials consisting of Ni as catalyst, CaO as CO2 sorbent and Ca2SiO4 as a polymorphic active spacer were synthesized. The different parameters (Ni loading, temperature, N2 flow rate and feedstock-to-catalyst ratio) have been investigated to optimise the H2 production. The catalysts were analysed by N2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was used to analyse the carbon formation on the used catalysts. The highest H2 production of 59.15 mmol g-1 of plastic was obtained in the presence of a catalyst with 20 wt.% Ni loading, which amounts to H2 purity as high as 54.2 vol% in gas production. Furthermore, 90.63 mmol g-1 of plastic of syngas was produced by increasing the feedstock-to-catalyst ratio to 4:1, yielding 84.4 vol.% of total gas product (53.1 vol.% of H2 and 31.3 vol.% of CO, respectively). The Ni-CaOCa2SiO4 hybrid-functional material is a very promising catalyst in the pyrolysis-catalytic gasification process by capturing CO2 as it is produced, therefore shifting the water gas shift (WGS) reaction to enhance H2 production from plastic waste. Detailed elucidation of the roles of each component at the microscale during the catalytic process was also provided through in-situ TEM analysis. The finding could guide the industry for future large-scale application to convert abundant plastic waste into H2-rich syngas, therefore contributing to the global ‘net zero’ ambition.
