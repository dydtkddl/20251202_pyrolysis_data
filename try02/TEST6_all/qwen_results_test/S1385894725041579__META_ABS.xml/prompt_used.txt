You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient valorization of textile white mud to MIL-101(Fe) with abundant coordinatively unsaturated centers for enhanced fenton-like catalysis Fe-based metal organic frameworks (Fe MOFs) offer a promising opportunity to drive chemical oxidation for efficient organic pollutant degradation, but conventional MOFs synthesis consumes analytical grade reagents, while crystalline MOFs lacks enough active sites. Here we report a low-crystalline MIL-101(Fe) based on terephthalic acid-enriched waste textile white mud (denoted as MIL-101(Fe)-W) that can activate H2O2 to proceed Fenton-like reaction with satisfactory •OH production and wide pH range (4 ∼ 10). Specifically, the low level of impurities (e.g. ethylene alcohol and undecomposed oligoesters) within textile white mud endows MIL-101(Fe)-W with plentiful coordinatively unsaturated FeII/FeIII centers (FeII/FeIII CUCs). MIL-101(Fe)-W triggers a ‘two-stage’ heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction, where the release of numerous protons due to surface complexation between FeII/FeIII CUCs and H2O2 in the sluggish stage boosts the subsequent rapid oxidation stage. Towards the removal of biorefractory 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), MIL-101(Fe)-W not only demonstrates 2.5-fold higher apparent rate constant than that of MIL-101(Fe) reference, but also outcompetes benchmarked Fe-based catalysts and homogeneous Fenton reaction. Active species identification, surface acidity analysis, and electrochemical techniques confirm the formation of enhanced surface H2O2 complex over MIL-101(Fe)-W, which results in the strengthened •OH-induced oxidation. Importantly, this novel catalyst exhibits favorable reusability and resistance to coexisting components within actual wastewater matrix for 4-CP removal. This work provides a proof-of-concept design on efficient valorization of typical industrial solid waste to high-performance MOFs catalyst, which gives a good example on rational design of waste-derived environmental functional materials for sustainable wastewater treatment.
