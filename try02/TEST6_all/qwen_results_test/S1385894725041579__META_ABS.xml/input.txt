Efficient valorization of textile white mud to MIL-101(Fe) with abundant coordinatively unsaturated centers for enhanced fenton-like catalysis Fe-based metal organic frameworks (Fe MOFs) offer a promising opportunity to drive chemical oxidation for efficient organic pollutant degradation, but conventional MOFs synthesis consumes analytical grade reagents, while crystalline MOFs lacks enough active sites. Here we report a low-crystalline MIL-101(Fe) based on terephthalic acid-enriched waste textile white mud (denoted as MIL-101(Fe)-W) that can activate H2O2 to proceed Fenton-like reaction with satisfactory •OH production and wide pH range (4 ∼ 10). Specifically, the low level of impurities (e.g. ethylene alcohol and undecomposed oligoesters) within textile white mud endows MIL-101(Fe)-W with plentiful coordinatively unsaturated FeII/FeIII centers (FeII/FeIII CUCs). MIL-101(Fe)-W triggers a ‘two-stage’ heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction, where the release of numerous protons due to surface complexation between FeII/FeIII CUCs and H2O2 in the sluggish stage boosts the subsequent rapid oxidation stage. Towards the removal of biorefractory 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), MIL-101(Fe)-W not only demonstrates 2.5-fold higher apparent rate constant than that of MIL-101(Fe) reference, but also outcompetes benchmarked Fe-based catalysts and homogeneous Fenton reaction. Active species identification, surface acidity analysis, and electrochemical techniques confirm the formation of enhanced surface H2O2 complex over MIL-101(Fe)-W, which results in the strengthened •OH-induced oxidation. Importantly, this novel catalyst exhibits favorable reusability and resistance to coexisting components within actual wastewater matrix for 4-CP removal. This work provides a proof-of-concept design on efficient valorization of typical industrial solid waste to high-performance MOFs catalyst, which gives a good example on rational design of waste-derived environmental functional materials for sustainable wastewater treatment.
