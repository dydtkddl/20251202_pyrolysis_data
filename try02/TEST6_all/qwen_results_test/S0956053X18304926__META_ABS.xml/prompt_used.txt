You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production, characterization and adsorption studies of bamboo-based biochar/montmorillonite composite for nitrate removal Biochar is a promising immobilization tool for various contaminants in liquid wastes, aqueous solutions and soils. To further improve the sorption characteristics, a biochar/montmorillonite composite was produced and synthesized in an experimental pyrolysis reactor, using bamboo as biomass feedstock. The composite was characterized by physico-chemical and structural methods (FTIR, SEM, SEM/EDX, SSA, Low temperature nitrogen adsorption method). Based on these methods, the successful preparation of a bamboo based biochar/montmorillonite composite preparation has been demonstrated. The particles of montmorillonite were distributed across the biochar surface. The adsorption studies for removal nitrates from aqueous solutions were investigated by a batch method at laboratory temperatures. The experimental data were fitted by three adsorption models (Langmuir, Freundlich and DR; R2 > 0.93). The maximum adsorption capacity achieved by biochar at pH 4, was about 5 mg g−1 and by biochar/montmorillonite composite 9 mg g−1. The results suggest that the bamboo-based biochar/montmorillonite composite can be used effectively in the treatment of industrial effluents or waste water containing anionic pollutants such as nitrates.
