Process evaluation and techno-economic analysis of biodiesel production from marine macroalgae Codium tomentosum In the current study, a seaweed Codium tomentosum was used as a source for the production of biodiesel. The maximum oil from marine macroalgae was recovered using ultrasound-assisted pretreatment. The oil yield was found to be maximum at optimal conditions such as 5% biomass wetness, 0.18 mm biomass size, 6:1 extraction solvent: biomass ratio, extraction temperature, and time as 55 °C and 140 min respectively. The extracted oil was transesterified using solidsolid nanocatalyst produced from waste clay doped with Zn. The maximum biodiesel conversion was found to be 90.5% at optimum conditions. The marine macroalgae C. tomentosum was found to be one of the potential sources for biodiesel production. The techno-economic analysis of the overall biodiesel production (20 MT/batch) process was investigated. The plant payback period is 8.59 years with a positive NPV of 1381 M$/yr.
