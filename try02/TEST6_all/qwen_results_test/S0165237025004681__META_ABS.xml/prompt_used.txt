You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of antioxidant addition on the thermal decomposition behavior of polyisoprene rubber during low-temperature pyrolysis The pyrolysis of used rubber is a promising approach for resource recovery; however, the selective recovery of isoprene remains a challenge due to extensive thermal decomposition and secondary reactions. This study proposes a co-pyrolysis process aimed at enhancing the retention of the isoprene skeleton in the recovered liquid rubber during low-temperature pyrolysis. A cross-linked polyisoprene rubber reinforced with carbon black was co-pyrolyzed with phenolic antioxidants, namely tetrakis[methylene(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]methane, denoted as AO-1010, and n-octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, denoted as AO-1076, to inhibit radical-induced structural degradation. The isoprene skeleton retention rate decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature for all samples. However, antioxidant-treated rubbers (AO-1010 and AO-1076) showed higher retention at 300 °C compared to untreated rubber, indicating that antioxidants can suppress thermal degradation and preserve the isoprene structure at elevated temperatures. For untreated rubber, the isoprene recovery rate increased from approximately 12 % at 200 °C to a peak of 53 % at 270 °C, followed by a sharp decline to 34 % at 300 °C, suggesting intensified secondary reactions at higher temperatures. In contrast, rubbers treated with antioxidants AO-1010 and AO-1076 exhibited improved stability at elevated temperatures. At 300 °C, the AO-1010- and AO-1076-treated rubbers maintained higher isoprene skeleton recovery rates of 50 % and 47 %, respectively. Additionally, antioxidant treatments significantly reduced the molecular weight of the rubber from Mw 340,000 to approximately 35,000 at 270 °C. These findings demonstrate that co-pyrolysis with antioxidants can better preserve the isoprene skeleton and increase liquid product yields at low temperatures. This approach offers a promising strategy for improving the efficiency and selectivity of isoprene recovery.
