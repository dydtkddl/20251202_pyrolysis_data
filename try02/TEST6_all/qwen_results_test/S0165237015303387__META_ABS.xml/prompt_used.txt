You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterisation of a bio-based packaging containing a natural additive from Allium spp. using analytical pyrolysis and carbon stable isotopes Analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) was used to fingerprint a polylactic acid (PLA) with polybutylene succinate (PBS) (950gKg−1:50gKg−1) film extruded with variable quantities (0, 20, 50 and 65gKg−1) of a commercial additive (Proallium®) prepared from Allium spp. extracts. The carbon isotopic signature(δ13C) was used to estimate the amount of additive to be incorporated into the casting of the active biopolymer. The main PLA:PBS pyrolysis products were lactide enantiomers and monomer units, in addition to structures from the PBS fraction. The pyrolysis of the plant extract additive, apart from a number of organosulphur compounds derived from the active ingredients, released oligomers of polyethylene glycol, alkyl ethers and a conspicuous peak of oleic acid, 3-hydroxypropyl ester compatible with a polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate surfactant. The sulphur compound, propyl sulphide, was a diagnostic peak with which to trace the additive in the polymer. In fact, a correlation coefficient of value 0.997R2 (p <0.001) was found between the chromatographic area of this peak and the amount of additive in the bioplastic. The real amount of additive incorporated in the bioplastic was estimated through a mass-balance equation, taking advantage of the differential δ13C signatures between the polymeric base and the additive.
