Co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics, and thermodynamics of sludge, lignite and biomass through fixed-bed reactor experiments and thermogravimetric analysis Co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics, and thermodynamic parameters of petrochemical sludge (PS), lignite (HL), and pine wood (PW) were investigated via fixed-bed reactor experiments and thermogravimetric analysis. Fixed-bed experiments showed H2 and CO2 were main gases from PS, HL, and blends, CO from PW and PS, and CO and CH4 from PS and HL. Thermal analysis indicated that ternary blends’ de-volatilization had two parts dominated by PW and HL, respectively. The comprehensive de-volatilization index increased from 7.0 × 10-7 to 3.3 × 10-6 %2/(min2·°C3) as PW ratio rose from 20 % to 40 %. Effects of heating rates on pyrolysis properties, kinetics, and thermodynamics were studied using thermal analysis data. Characteristic indices increased, and activation energies decreased with HL or PW mixing; minimum activation energy was 147.2 kJ/mol for PS and HL blend. Blending lignite and biomass improved pyrolysis indices of petrochemical sludge and reduced activation energy and thermodynamic parameters, benefiting sludge disposal.
