You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics, and thermodynamics of sludge, lignite and biomass through fixed-bed reactor experiments and thermogravimetric analysis Co-pyrolysis behaviors, kinetics, and thermodynamic parameters of petrochemical sludge (PS), lignite (HL), and pine wood (PW) were investigated via fixed-bed reactor experiments and thermogravimetric analysis. Fixed-bed experiments showed H2 and CO2 were main gases from PS, HL, and blends, CO from PW and PS, and CO and CH4 from PS and HL. Thermal analysis indicated that ternary blends’ de-volatilization had two parts dominated by PW and HL, respectively. The comprehensive de-volatilization index increased from 7.0 × 10-7 to 3.3 × 10-6 %2/(min2·°C3) as PW ratio rose from 20 % to 40 %. Effects of heating rates on pyrolysis properties, kinetics, and thermodynamics were studied using thermal analysis data. Characteristic indices increased, and activation energies decreased with HL or PW mixing; minimum activation energy was 147.2 kJ/mol for PS and HL blend. Blending lignite and biomass improved pyrolysis indices of petrochemical sludge and reduced activation energy and thermodynamic parameters, benefiting sludge disposal.
