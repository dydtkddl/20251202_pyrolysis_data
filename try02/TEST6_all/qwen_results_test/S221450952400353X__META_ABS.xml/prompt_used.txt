You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Rheological evaluation of paving asphalt binder containing bio-oil from rice straw pyrolysis The conversion of rice straw to bio-oil for substituting asphalt paving materials not only contributes to sustainable development in construction industry, but is also beneficial for resource recovery in agriculture. In this study, rice straw was pyrolyzed to produce bio-oil by using fluidized bed, and the influences of key pyrolysis conditions on product distribution were investigated. Bio-asphalt was prepared by high-speed mixing of pyrolysis bio-oil and petroleum asphalt, and comprehensively evaluated through rheological tests and continuous grading of performance grade (PG). Moreover, microscopic characterization was conducted to further explore the mechanism of bio-oil modification of asphalt. The test results indicate that the yield of bio-oil first rises and then drops with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. As the gas flow rate increases and the biomass particle size decreases, the bio-oil yield shows an increasing trend. The bio-asphalt containing bio-oil from lower pyrolysis temperatures has stronger rutting resistance and lower temperature susceptibility. As the pyrolysis temperature rises, the resistances of bio-asphalt to fatigue and thermal cracking are enhanced. According to continuous PG grading, the widest safe working temperature range is obtained at 450 ℃. Compared to base asphalt, bio-asphalt has superior fatigue and low-temperature performances at high pyrolysis temperatures. Additionally, it can be known from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that the modification of petroleum asphalt by bio-oil is a physical fusion process.
