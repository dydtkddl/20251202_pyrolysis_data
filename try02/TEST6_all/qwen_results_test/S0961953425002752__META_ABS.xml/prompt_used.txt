You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Techno-economic and life cycle assessment of CO2 storage using amorphous carbon derived from end-of-life Polyethylene Terephthalate Plastics have become an integral part of our daily life. The advantages and benefits of plastic applications are counterbalanced by its drawbacks. Governments across the world are struggling to repurpose or value used plastic products. To minimize greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, this study aims to recover carbon from waste Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) based plastics into value-added products. The study also aims to model and simulate the feasibility of converting End of Life PET(EOL-PET) to porous carbon for CO2 capture. Pyrolysis is regarded as one of the most effective methods for turning long-chain hydrocarbons into low-molecular-weight compounds. EOL-PET can be converted to value-added products like pyrolysis oil and porous carbon. In this study, non-recyclable PET plastics are pyrolyzed into gaseous, liquid, and solid/ash products. EOL-PET is carbonized, and the carbonized PET is heated with KOH (activating agent) in the presence of N2. The KOH method improves the textural properties of the porous carbon and the CO2 uptake and increases the efficiency of adsorption. Simulated the complete process of the conversion of Waste PET into porous carbon and that porous carbon used as an adsorbent for CO2 storage using Aspen Plus. Performed the detailed techno-economic feasibility using Aspen Plus, obtained the pay-back period for derived porous carbon from waste PET and CO2 storage is 2.5 years. Performed the detailed environmental feasibility analysis using OpenLCA, it resulted that the Global warming potential of porous carbon is higher than Carbon derived from various sources like woody biomass, Activated Carbon (AC) from olive waste cakes, and granulated AC.
