You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of diesel fuel production from bio-oils hydrodeoxygenation using unsupported MoS2 catalysts Diesel production from lignocellulosic biomass-derived fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) and catalytic pyrolysis bio-oil (CPBO) was investigated with an upgrading approach using unsupported MoS2 catalysts generated in situ. Hydrodeoxygenation of FPBO and CPBO was evaluated in a continuous-flow reactor system using feed blends containing 18 wt% bio-oil in fuel oil. For FPBO, 92.9 % deoxygenation was achieved with 0.51 wt% O in oil products, resulting in low acidity (0.32 mg KOH/g), while 74.8 % deoxygenation was obtained for CPBO with 1.24 wt% O and 0.48 mg KOH/g acidity in oil products. The lower deoxygenation of CPBO suggests that oxygenates in CPBO are less reactive than those in FPBO. In both cases, low solid yields were observed from 1.2 to 2.0 g/100 g bio-oil. XRD and HRTEM detected few-layer stacked structure for the in-situ formed MoS2 catalysts. The oil product from CPBO retained more biogenic carbon than from FPBO, with the diesel fraction from CPBO exhibiting a higher biogenic carbon content and yield. Both diesel cuts meet almost all ASTM D975 specifications, except for S content, resulting from the high S/Mo feed ratio used in the tests. Evaluation results demonstrated great potential for producing specifications-conforming diesel fractions from FPBO and CPBO upgrading using unsupported MoS2 catalyst.
