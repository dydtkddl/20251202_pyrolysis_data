You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable developments in polyolefin chemistry: Progress, challenges, and outlook Polyolefins are the largest-scale synthetic plastics and play a key role in modern society. Their production consumes huge amounts of fossil-derived monomer feedstocks, which unfortunately became discarded wastes after use with a very low recycling ratio, causing severe environmental pollution and huge consumption of non-renewable resources. This lack of sustainability could in principle be solved by reusing the waste polyolefins repeatedly as virgin materials or recovering olefin monomers for re-entering the polyolefin cycle. However, it is challenging due to their chemical inertness (C-H and C-C bonds) and lack of degradation sites along the polyolefin chains. Therefore, to make polyolefins more sustainable, degrading or modifying the waste polyolefins on large scales could facilitate their reuse as virgin polyolefins or recovery to polymerizable feedstocks, rethinking the design and synthesis from monomer feedstocks could afford inherently recyclable and thus more sustainable polyolefin or polyolefin-like materials. Given the above, this review will introduce recent progress in the rapidly advancing field: 1) Recycling and upcycling to fuels and other small molecule products, olefin monomer, telechelic products, reprocessable and functional polyolefin materials; 2) Increasing sustainability by the de novo design and synthesis of new degradable and reprocessable polyolefin and polyolefin-like polymers.
