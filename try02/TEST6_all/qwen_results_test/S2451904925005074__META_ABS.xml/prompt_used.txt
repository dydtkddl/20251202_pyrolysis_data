You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable recycling of waste toner powder via pyrolysis: high-value bio-oil production and biochar catalyst Innovation Waste toner powder is one of the main types of electronic waste, causing serious health and environmental problems challenges. A large portion of waste toner isn’t recycled and is instead dumped in landfills due to limitations in recycling technologies. Pyrolysis is an important method used to convert different types of wastes into valuable products, primarily bio-oil. This study investigates the potential of pyrolysis as a recycling option for WTP, a process not previously investigated in detail. Firstly, the degradation and kinetics of waste toner powder were evaluated. Secondly, the pyrolysis of waste toner powder was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at different temperatures ranging from 450 °C to 650 °C, and the ultimate analysis of the produced bio-oil and biochar was presented. Thirdly, the potential of using biochar as a catalyst in biomass pyrolysis was investigated. The kinetic parameters, mainly the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, and the thermodynamic parameters were estimated. The obtained results showed that the average value of activation energy ranged from 152.2 to 152.8 kJ/mol. The pyrolysis experiments revealed that increasing temperature increased bio-oil yield by 27 %. The ultimate analysis of the produced bio-oil indicated high carbon and hydrogen contents of 75.68 % and 8.165 %, respectively, with a higher heating value of 37 MJ/kg. The XRF analysis indicated that the waste toner powder biochar contains a higher iron oxide content of 81.15 %, which improves its catalyst characteristics, thus it was used as in the pyrolysis of the doum shell. Using biochar, a catalyst in the pyrolysis of doum shell waste increased the bio-oil yield from 20 % to 40 %, representing a remarkable improvement of 100 %. The study findings present waste toner powder as a valuable source of bio-oil and a low-cost catalyst for waste pyrolysis.
