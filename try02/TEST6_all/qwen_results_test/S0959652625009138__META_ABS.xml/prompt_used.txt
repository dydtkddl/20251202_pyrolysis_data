You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling of end-of-life wind turbine blades: Enhanced phenolic compounds production through catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy resin and polyvinylchloride with zinc chloride-balsa activated carbon Pyrolysis of core materials (balsa wood, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinylchloride) mixed directly with end-of-life wind turbine blades (EolWTBs) increased by-products and reduced the product quality. To maximize EolWTBs utilization, this study innovatively synthesized zinc chloride–activated carbon (ZnCl2–AC) using balsa cores (EolWTB-1) as waste-to-value for catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy resins (EolWTB-3) and polyvinylchloride cores (EolWTB-4) to enhance the phenolic compounds production. Fixed-bed experiments showed that 1ZnCl2–1AC with ZnCl2 activator and a Zn/balsa ratio of 1:1 exhibited the optimal performance at 600 °C. A synergistic effect was further observed when EolWTB-3 and EolWTB-4 were co-pyrolyzed at a mixing ratio of 0.75:0.25 with selectivity of 76.27 % and 96.27 % for phenol and phenolic compounds, respectively. The reusability test showed that the decreasing trend of phenol selectivity was slow and much higher than that of the non-catalytic group. Reaction mechanism studies showed that the high specific surface area of the catalyst with abundant Lewis acid sites promoted the aromatization of macromolecular organic compounds and the conversion of oxygen-containing functional groups to phenolic hydroxyl groups. The findings will simultaneously enable the waste-to-value conversion of balsa wood and upgrade the reuse value of EolWTBs, offering an alternative method for recycling EolWTBs.
