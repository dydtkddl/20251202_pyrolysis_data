Membrane and membrane-integrated processes for nanoplastics removal and remediation The impact of nanoplastics on the environment and human health is a growing concern. Due to their small size and chemical properties, nanoplastics pose a higher risk than microplastics. Membrane filtration processes have been identified as effective for nanoplastic removal, but integration with other remediation techniques is necessary, except for membrane bioreactors. Membrane bioreactors show promise in handling nanoplastics due to their bioprocessing capability. This review critically evaluates current research on membrane processes and their integration for nanoplastic removal. It discusses the principles and challenges associated with these technologies. The study provides new strategies to expand the industrial-scale application of membrane processes for the treatment of nanoplastics. This review highlights the importance of addressing nanoplastic pollution and presents avenues for future research and implementation.
