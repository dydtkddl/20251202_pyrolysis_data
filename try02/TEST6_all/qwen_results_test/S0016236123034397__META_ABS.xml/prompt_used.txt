You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of low molecular oil from typical polyolefin plastics through molten salts thermal treatment The resource recovery based on pyrolysis has become the mainstream disposal method for polyolefin plastics in recent years. However, the poor heat transfer characteristics and uneven temperature distribution of plastics lead to inferior product quality. To address these problems, molten salts thermal treatment was performed to conduct targeted regulation of the process. It revealed that the excellent heat storage and thermal conductivity of molten salts provide a strengthened heat source for plastics, promoting product homogenization and high-value conversion. It reduced the energy barrier of the reaction and prompted the conversion of macromolecular components to light oil. Meanwhile, the catalysis of alkali metal salts effectively inhibited the transition cracking of major oil components. The yield of pyrolysis oil increased while the valuable products gradually accumulated, such as α-olefins (ranging from 26.48 % to 31.06 %) and styrene (ranging from 48.89 % to 64.03 %). Additionally, the kinetics of hydrogen could be used to analyze the dynamic processes of plastic pyrolysis well and the activation energy was significantly reduced with molten salts. The contracting volume model was considered to be the most suitable reaction model, providing critical insight for the thermal treatment of plastics at larger scales.
