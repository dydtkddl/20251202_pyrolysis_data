You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reactive synthesis for porous TiVAlC ceramics by TiH2,V, Al and graphite powders Using the mixed powder of TiH2, graphite, aluminum and vanadium as starting materials, porous TiVAlC ceramics were fabricated by the reactive synthesis technology at 1300 °C. The chemical steadiness of porous TiVAlC along with the effects of sintering temperature on the viscous permeability coefficient, strength, porosity, pore size and volume expansion rate of the porous TiVAlC were explored, and the mechanism of pore formation was also revealed. The preparation process includes five steps as follows: (i) the complete decomposition of stearic acid at 500 °C; (ii) the pyrolysis of TiH2 at 700 °C, converting TiH2 into hydrogen and titanium (iii) The solid-liquid chemical reaction of solid vanadium, titanium and molten aluminum at 700 °C, converting the mixture into V–Al and Ti–Al compounds; (iv) At 900–1100 °C, Surplus V and Ti interact with graphite to synthesize carbides of TiVC2, VC, and TiC; (v) Reactive synthesized carbides (TiVC2, VC, and TiC), Ti2AlC, V–Al and Ti–Al compounds that yield porous TiVAlC at 1300 °C.
