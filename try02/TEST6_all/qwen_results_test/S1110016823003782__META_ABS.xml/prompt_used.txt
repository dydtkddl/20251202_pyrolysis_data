You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-hydrothermal carbonization of digested sewage sludge and sugarcane bagasse: Integrated approach for waste management, optimized production, characterization and Pb(II) adsorption Integrated biomass waste management and fresh water supply are crucial environmental problems that researchers are laboring to clarify today. The co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) of sugarcane bagasse (SB) and digested sewage sludge (DSS), with KOH activation, for SB and DSS waste management, was accomplished. In this research, the effect of process parameters and biomass ratio during co-HTC on modified hydrochar adsorption capacities was critically evaluated. To optimize operating parameters (temperature, time, catalyst/precursor ratio, water/precursor ratio, and SB/DSS ratio, response surface methodology was used. The optimum condition was 180 °C, 9.6 h, 3/1 DSS/SB ratio ( w w ), 5.00 water/precursor ratio ( w w ), and 3.50 ZnCl2/precursor ratio ( w w ). The optimum hydochar was featured using BET, SEM, FTIR, TGA, and elemental analysis and used to study the adsorptive ability of lead. The adsorption isotherm and kinetic model matched reasonably with the Langmuir ( 127.61 mg g ) and pseudo-second-order models ( 130.68 mg g ). Moreover, the kinetic adsorption studies showed that 85 percent of adsorption capacity was achieved in the first 15 min. Our study strongly confirmed that co-HTC of DSS and SB, can be used as a green and environmental safety approach for sludge management and clean water supplement followed by lead removal with acceptable reusability of adsorbent.
