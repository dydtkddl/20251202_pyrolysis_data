You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and properties of tungsten-rhenium alloys resistant to ultra-high temperatures Tungsten‑rhenium (W-Re) alloys are extensively used in medical devices, electronics, industrial equipment, aerospace, and nuclear energy sectors due to their low ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), excellent high-temperature creep resistance, and superior properties related to recrystallization, ablation, and irradiation at elevated temperatures. However, with the advancement of technologies in these critical fields, the performance demands on W-Re alloys are continually increasing. As a result, optimizing the fabrication processes of W-Re alloys to enhance their performance under ultra-high temperature conditions has become essential. This review provides a detailed overview of the ultra-high temperature applications of W-Re alloys, the effects of Re alloying on their performance, various strengthening methods and mechanisms, and fabrication techniques. By analyzing the strengthening mechanisms, we identify that advancements in powder preparation, bulk densification, and deformation processing are key to improving the stable performance of W-Re alloys under extreme temperatures. Additionally, we address several challenges related to the fabrication methods and propose solutions. We hope that this comprehensive review will support researchers in developing W-Re alloys with enhanced performance while addressing the production and engineering challenges involved.
