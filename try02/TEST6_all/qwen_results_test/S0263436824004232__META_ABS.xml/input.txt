Preparation and properties of tungsten-rhenium alloys resistant to ultra-high temperatures Tungsten‑rhenium (W-Re) alloys are extensively used in medical devices, electronics, industrial equipment, aerospace, and nuclear energy sectors due to their low ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT), excellent high-temperature creep resistance, and superior properties related to recrystallization, ablation, and irradiation at elevated temperatures. However, with the advancement of technologies in these critical fields, the performance demands on W-Re alloys are continually increasing. As a result, optimizing the fabrication processes of W-Re alloys to enhance their performance under ultra-high temperature conditions has become essential. This review provides a detailed overview of the ultra-high temperature applications of W-Re alloys, the effects of Re alloying on their performance, various strengthening methods and mechanisms, and fabrication techniques. By analyzing the strengthening mechanisms, we identify that advancements in powder preparation, bulk densification, and deformation processing are key to improving the stable performance of W-Re alloys under extreme temperatures. Additionally, we address several challenges related to the fabrication methods and propose solutions. We hope that this comprehensive review will support researchers in developing W-Re alloys with enhanced performance while addressing the production and engineering challenges involved.
