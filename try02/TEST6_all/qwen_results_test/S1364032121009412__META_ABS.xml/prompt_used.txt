You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of renewable and sustainable biosourced carbon through pyrolysis in biocomposites uses: Current development and future opportunity Highly order-structured carbon-based materials such as graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes hold promise in delivering the next generation of carbon-based advanced composite materials due to their superior performance in many applications. Recently, partially graphitic biosourced carbon (BioC) has shown to be a new, sustainable, inexpensive and practical alternative carbonaceous functional filler for polymer and biocomposite development (i.e. thermoplastic, thermoset, elastomer and foam). The thermochemical conversion of different types of biomass in a limited oxygen environment (pyrolysis) can be controlled and optimized to produce engineered BioCs with tunable surface area, morphology, polarity, porosity, intrinsic modulus and carbon content, which are being explored in different applications. Renewable BioCs exhibit variable surface chemistry that can be further modified to achieve better compatibility with polymers. BioC can be used as a reinforcing agent and as a multi-functional filler (e.g. electrical conductivity, antimicrobial, fire retardant, etc.) for polymer composite uses, which opens a new generation of biobased composite materials in the commercial market. This article provides an in-depth review of the current state-of-the-art fabrication, characterization, and performance of the BioC-based biocomposites. Further, the effect of the different synthesized BioCs on the polymers’ behavior and performance are reviewed in-depth. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for these BioC-based biocomposites are discussed.
