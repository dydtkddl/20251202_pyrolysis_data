Enhancing light aromatics production by pre-cracking and enriching effect in catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene over encapsulated ZSM-5@SBA-15 composites The directional pyrolysis of waste plastics into chemicals is limited by the poor access of long-chain paraffin primary vapors to the acid-sites in zeolite micropores during the reaction. We propose enhancing light aromatics (BTEX) production in polypropylene catalytic pyrolysis using encapsulated ZSM-5@SBA-15 composites. The SBA-15 silica encapsulation pre-cracks the bulky paraffins into light aliphatics, enriches these intermediates, and facilitates their diffusion into the ZSM-5 core micropores via the interconnected meso-micro interface, improving the accessibility of internal acid-sites. Through this designed structure, the plastic is sequentially cracked and aromatized into BTEX. Compared to conventional ZSM-5, the composite increases BTEX yield by 49.1 %, reduces heavy hydrocarbons by 42.2 %, and doubles the light-to-heavy hydrocarbon ratio. Acidity analyses and DFT calculations confirm that the encapsulation passivates the external acid-sites of ZSM-5 core, suppressing oligomerization and hard coke formation. This integrated hierarchy combines improved acid-sites accessibility with interface passivation, efficiently catalyzing plastic waste into valuable products for sustainable recycling.
