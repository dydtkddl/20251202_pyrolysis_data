You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient CO2 capture by a defect-driven O/N co-doped ultramicroporous carbon derived from plastics and biomass solid wastes As the largest emitting greenhouse gas, CO2 capture is essential to combat global warming and climate change. At the same time, bulk solid waste disposal also faces serious environmental hazards, due to its large stock, difficult degradation and low resource recycling rate. In this work, the CO2 was efficiently captured by a carbon material derived from the non-degradable plastics waste high-density polyethene (HDPE) and biomass waste spent coffee grounds (SCGs). The synthesized PE@CG-(1:2) exhibits an excellent ultramicroporous structure, attributed to the decomposition of the two carbon sources during the pyrolysis process, which generates numbers of high-energy defect sites further promoting structural expansion. The CO2 adsorption capacity was achieved as high as 5.37 mmol·g−1 at 0 ℃ (1 bar) and 1.49 mmol·g−1 under dynamic adsorption with simulated flue gas. Based on density-functional theory (DFT), the doped O/N functional groups introduced from SCGs benefit CO2 adsorption by enhancing the electrostatic attraction between carbon material and CO2, as the following order: –COOH > –N5 > –C=O > −N6 > –OH > UMP > Nonporous. The reuse of solid wastes into CO2 adsorbents provides a new strategy for the waste disposal, which is also paramount in combating global warming and the resource sustainable development.
