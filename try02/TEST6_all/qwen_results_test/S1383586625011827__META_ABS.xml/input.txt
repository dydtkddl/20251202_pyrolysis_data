Efficient CO2 capture by a defect-driven O/N co-doped ultramicroporous carbon derived from plastics and biomass solid wastes As the largest emitting greenhouse gas, CO2 capture is essential to combat global warming and climate change. At the same time, bulk solid waste disposal also faces serious environmental hazards, due to its large stock, difficult degradation and low resource recycling rate. In this work, the CO2 was efficiently captured by a carbon material derived from the non-degradable plastics waste high-density polyethene (HDPE) and biomass waste spent coffee grounds (SCGs). The synthesized PE@CG-(1:2) exhibits an excellent ultramicroporous structure, attributed to the decomposition of the two carbon sources during the pyrolysis process, which generates numbers of high-energy defect sites further promoting structural expansion. The CO2 adsorption capacity was achieved as high as 5.37 mmol·g−1 at 0 ℃ (1 bar) and 1.49 mmol·g−1 under dynamic adsorption with simulated flue gas. Based on density-functional theory (DFT), the doped O/N functional groups introduced from SCGs benefit CO2 adsorption by enhancing the electrostatic attraction between carbon material and CO2, as the following order: –COOH > –N5 > –C=O > −N6 > –OH > UMP > Nonporous. The reuse of solid wastes into CO2 adsorbents provides a new strategy for the waste disposal, which is also paramount in combating global warming and the resource sustainable development.
