Recent advances on catalysts for improving hydrocarbon compounds in bio-oil of biomass catalytic pyrolysis This paper reports the progress of catalysts for improving the hydrocarbon compounds in bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. In addition, the effects of the other operating conditions, such as temperature, type of biomass, heating rate, vapors residence time, carrier gas, and hydrogen donor on the yield and properties of bio-oil have been briefly explored. Temperature and catalysts type were found to have major impact on the bio-oil yield and quality. TGA-DTA analysis of biomass revealed that major biomasses pyrolysis zone for high bio-oil yield is in the range of 400–600 °C. Pilot, semi-pilot and large-scale units reported an average temperature of 500 °C for pyrolysis of biomass. The development of advanced catalysts such as zeolite-based catalysts, supported transition and noble metal catalysts, and metal oxide catalysts have been designed to remove the undesired compounds and to increase the hydrocarbon yield in bio-oil. Noble metal supported catalysts produced bio-oil with a low content of oxygenated compounds compared to non-noble metal catalysts; however, their cost and accessibility favor the utilization of non-noble metal supported catalysts.
