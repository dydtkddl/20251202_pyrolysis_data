You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances on catalysts for improving hydrocarbon compounds in bio-oil of biomass catalytic pyrolysis This paper reports the progress of catalysts for improving the hydrocarbon compounds in bio-oil obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of biomass. In addition, the effects of the other operating conditions, such as temperature, type of biomass, heating rate, vapors residence time, carrier gas, and hydrogen donor on the yield and properties of bio-oil have been briefly explored. Temperature and catalysts type were found to have major impact on the bio-oil yield and quality. TGA-DTA analysis of biomass revealed that major biomasses pyrolysis zone for high bio-oil yield is in the range of 400–600 °C. Pilot, semi-pilot and large-scale units reported an average temperature of 500 °C for pyrolysis of biomass. The development of advanced catalysts such as zeolite-based catalysts, supported transition and noble metal catalysts, and metal oxide catalysts have been designed to remove the undesired compounds and to increase the hydrocarbon yield in bio-oil. Noble metal supported catalysts produced bio-oil with a low content of oxygenated compounds compared to non-noble metal catalysts; however, their cost and accessibility favor the utilization of non-noble metal supported catalysts.
