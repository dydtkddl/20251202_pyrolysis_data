You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-temperature catalytic hydrogenation of silicon and germanium tetrachlorides on the modified nickel chloride The catalytic reduction of SiCl4 and GeCl4 by hydrogen to silicon and germanium nanopowder was carried out over a modified nickel chloride catalyst. The effects of nickel chloride surface on the reaction were intensively investigated. The results show that modified nickel chloride surface play an important role in reduction the value of the activation energy and reaction temperature of the catalytic hydrogenation SiCl4 and GeCl4. Elemental analysis of the catalyst and reaction results demonstrate that the catalyst operates in a temperature range from 423 to 573K. Further temperature increase above 623K was impractical as it led to a change in catalyst composition and silicide/germanide is formed in reactor. The resulting knowledge has helped to assume the reaction mechanism which is based on the formation of SiCl2 and GeCl2 in the reaction zone. This study will be useful in understanding the reduction of SiCl4 and GeCl4 with hydrogen and provides information regarding the development of a SiCl4 converter for a Siemens reactor to produce poly-Si in the solar cell industry and produce Ge nanopowders with minimum energy consumption.
