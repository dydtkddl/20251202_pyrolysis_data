You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Life cycle assessment of bioproducts from bamboo residues with biphasic phenoxyethanol-acid based biorefinery technology Utilizing bamboo residues to produce decarbonization energy products or materials diverts wastes from low-value treatment and supports the circular bioeconomy at the same time. This study develops a cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessment (LCA) for a biorefinery converting bamboo residues into bioproducts (ethanol, polylactic acid (PLA), and bio-based wood adhesive) in China. To combat the low enzymatic hydrolysis performance of bamboo residues and valorize the lignin, this study adopts a biphasic pretreatment by coupling phenoxyethanol and sulfuric acid solution (1%) to achieve high fermentable sugar production. The LCA study is coupled with a process simulation for an industrial-scale biorefinery based on the experimental data. Our results show that the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 17.0–32.1 gCO2e/MJ for ethanol cases and 3.2–3.7 kgCO2e/kg for PLA cases, when biphasic pretreatment is adopted. The lower GWP values are achieved by using 1:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution, though it has a lower product yield than 4:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution cases. Without biphasic pretreatment, the GWP is 135.8 gCO2e/MJ ethanol and 4.4 kgCO2e/kg PLA. For the perspective of treating 1 dry t bamboo residues, with biphasic pretreatment, the GWP is −174 to −66 kgCO2e for ethanol cases and −542 to −432 kgCO2e for PLA cases. The lower GWP is also from using 1:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution (1%). These GWP ranges are lower than conventional landfilling (2969 kgCO2e) and landfilling with landfill gas recovery (−28 kgCO2e).
