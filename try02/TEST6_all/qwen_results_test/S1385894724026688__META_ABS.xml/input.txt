Life cycle assessment of bioproducts from bamboo residues with biphasic phenoxyethanol-acid based biorefinery technology Utilizing bamboo residues to produce decarbonization energy products or materials diverts wastes from low-value treatment and supports the circular bioeconomy at the same time. This study develops a cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessment (LCA) for a biorefinery converting bamboo residues into bioproducts (ethanol, polylactic acid (PLA), and bio-based wood adhesive) in China. To combat the low enzymatic hydrolysis performance of bamboo residues and valorize the lignin, this study adopts a biphasic pretreatment by coupling phenoxyethanol and sulfuric acid solution (1%) to achieve high fermentable sugar production. The LCA study is coupled with a process simulation for an industrial-scale biorefinery based on the experimental data. Our results show that the life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 17.0–32.1 gCO2e/MJ for ethanol cases and 3.2–3.7 kgCO2e/kg for PLA cases, when biphasic pretreatment is adopted. The lower GWP values are achieved by using 1:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution, though it has a lower product yield than 4:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution cases. Without biphasic pretreatment, the GWP is 135.8 gCO2e/MJ ethanol and 4.4 kgCO2e/kg PLA. For the perspective of treating 1 dry t bamboo residues, with biphasic pretreatment, the GWP is −174 to −66 kgCO2e for ethanol cases and −542 to −432 kgCO2e for PLA cases. The lower GWP is also from using 1:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution (1%). These GWP ranges are lower than conventional landfilling (2969 kgCO2e) and landfilling with landfill gas recovery (−28 kgCO2e).
