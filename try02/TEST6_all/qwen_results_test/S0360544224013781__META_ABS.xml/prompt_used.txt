You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analyses of novel solar- and biomass-driven trigeneration system integrated with organic Rankine cycle This study proposes a combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system driven by biomass and solar energy integrated with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Its exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental performances are investigated. First, the thermodynamic parameters of each material and energy flow for the proposed CCHP system are simulated using Aspen Plus. Second, the exergy and exergoeconomic performances of the system are investigated, and an exergoenvironmental analysis of the system is performed. The results show that the unit exergy costs (UEC) of domestic hot water, electricity generated by an internal combustion engine (ICE) and the ORC, and chilled/heated water under summer/winter conditions are 2.742/2.742, 6.713/6.629, 12.930/12.930, and 27.100/12.530 MW/MW, respectively, with corresponding unit exergoeconomic costs (UEEC) of 41.11/41.11, 124.40/139.20, 181.80/181.80, and 507.10/302.60 USD/MWh, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding environmental impact rates per exergy unit are 0.616/0.616, 2.988/3.023, 0.030/0.030, and 6.567/3.072 mPts/MJ, respectively. The results highlight the urgency to prioritize improvements to the solar collector performance to reduce the UEC of electricity generated by the ORC. The absorption chiller/heater, heat exchanger, and ICE exhibit significant potential for enhancing their exergoeconomic performance. Additionally, the gasifier, ICE, and ORC can be optimized to mitigate their environmental impact with relatively minimal exertion.
