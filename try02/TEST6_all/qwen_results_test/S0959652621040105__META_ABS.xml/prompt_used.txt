You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High added-value materials recovery using electronic scrap-transforming waste to valuable products Due to the rapid development in electronic industries and high consumer demand, electrical and electronic equipment have a shorter lifetime in developed and developing countries markets, leading to tons of electronic waste. The waste Printed circuit board (PCBs) contain many valuable metals like gold and copper and hazardous materials like lead. Therefore, recycling the metallic and non-metallic fractions from waste PCBs using environmentally friendly and suitable sustainable resource utilization techniques is in high demand. In this direction, nanotechnology has also been recently used to recover base metals, toxic metals, and precious metals in different sizes and morphologies. This study provides an up-to-date review of research on recovering high added value (HAV) materials from various electronic waste components. These include high purity metals, nanoparticles, nanostructured alloys, nanocomposites, high purity ultrafine particles, and microfibers. It also includes the properties investigated and the potential applications of the obtained HAV products in fields such as wastewater treatment, detection of incessant pollutants, biomedicine, and catalysis. Current challenges faced in scaling up the e-waste derived nanoproducts manufacturing are also discussed in the concluding remarks.
