You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS method for the target/untargeted analysis of microplastics in air Pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled to Orbitrap-mass spectrometry is a novel technique that allows the low level and precise determination of microplastics in environmental samples. In this paper, we develop and assess the target and untargeted performance of Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS. The method was optimized for 10 plastic polymers: polymethyl methacrylate, nylon-6,6, polypropylene, nitrile butadiene rubber, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and polystyrene. Standards were home-made using a diamond driller to attain mean sizes within the range of 45–382 µm. A step-by-step optimization of the analytical procedure was carried out. First, accurate mass measurement of each polymer at 60,000 resolution was studied to select the 3 most intense and selective quantification and confirmation ions. Second, internal standard quantification was optimized, and good linearity, repeatability, and reproducibility were obtained. Blank contribution and instrumental detection limit were evaluated for each polymer. Finally, the combined and expanded uncertainty of the Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS method was calculated to determine the sources of variation, considering that home-made standards were used. To evaluate method performance, targeted and non-targeted analysis of indoor air samples collected from gyms and department stores were carried out. The Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS methodology herein described can be applied for the quantitative assessment of MPs and other substances in different matrices.
