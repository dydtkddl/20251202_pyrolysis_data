Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS method for the target/untargeted analysis of microplastics in air Pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled to Orbitrap-mass spectrometry is a novel technique that allows the low level and precise determination of microplastics in environmental samples. In this paper, we develop and assess the target and untargeted performance of Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS. The method was optimized for 10 plastic polymers: polymethyl methacrylate, nylon-6,6, polypropylene, nitrile butadiene rubber, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and polystyrene. Standards were home-made using a diamond driller to attain mean sizes within the range of 45–382 µm. A step-by-step optimization of the analytical procedure was carried out. First, accurate mass measurement of each polymer at 60,000 resolution was studied to select the 3 most intense and selective quantification and confirmation ions. Second, internal standard quantification was optimized, and good linearity, repeatability, and reproducibility were obtained. Blank contribution and instrumental detection limit were evaluated for each polymer. Finally, the combined and expanded uncertainty of the Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS method was calculated to determine the sources of variation, considering that home-made standards were used. To evaluate method performance, targeted and non-targeted analysis of indoor air samples collected from gyms and department stores were carried out. The Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS methodology herein described can be applied for the quantitative assessment of MPs and other substances in different matrices.
