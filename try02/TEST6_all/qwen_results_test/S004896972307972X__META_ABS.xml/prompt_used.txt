You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical catalytic upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste into value-added materials, fuels and chemicals The substantial production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products, coupled with high abandonment rates, results in significant environmental pollution and resource wastage. This has prompted global attention to the development of rational strategies for PET waste treatment. In the context of renewability and sustainability, catalytic chemical technology provides an effective means to recycle and upcycle PET waste into valuable resources. In this review, we initially provide an overview of strategies employed in the thermocatalytic process to recycle PET waste into valuable carbon materials, fuels and typical refined chemicals. The effect of catalysts on the quality and quantity of specific products is highlighted. Next, we introduce the development of renewable-energy-driven electrocatalytic and photocatalytic systems for sustainable PET waste upcycling, focusing on rational catalysts, innovative catalytic system design, and corresponding underlying catalytic mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of three chemical catalytic strategies. Finally, existing limitations and outlook toward controllable selectivity and yield enhancement of value-added products and PET upvaluing technology for scale-up applications are proposed. This review aims to inspire the exploration of waste-to-treasure technologies for renewable-energy-driven waste management toward a circular economy.
