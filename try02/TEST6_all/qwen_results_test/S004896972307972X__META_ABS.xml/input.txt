Chemical catalytic upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste into value-added materials, fuels and chemicals The substantial production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products, coupled with high abandonment rates, results in significant environmental pollution and resource wastage. This has prompted global attention to the development of rational strategies for PET waste treatment. In the context of renewability and sustainability, catalytic chemical technology provides an effective means to recycle and upcycle PET waste into valuable resources. In this review, we initially provide an overview of strategies employed in the thermocatalytic process to recycle PET waste into valuable carbon materials, fuels and typical refined chemicals. The effect of catalysts on the quality and quantity of specific products is highlighted. Next, we introduce the development of renewable-energy-driven electrocatalytic and photocatalytic systems for sustainable PET waste upcycling, focusing on rational catalysts, innovative catalytic system design, and corresponding underlying catalytic mechanisms. Moreover, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of three chemical catalytic strategies. Finally, existing limitations and outlook toward controllable selectivity and yield enhancement of value-added products and PET upvaluing technology for scale-up applications are proposed. This review aims to inspire the exploration of waste-to-treasure technologies for renewable-energy-driven waste management toward a circular economy.
