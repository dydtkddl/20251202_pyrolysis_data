You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrolytic nanozymes: Classification, activity regulation, and applications in sensing and degradation of environmental pollutants The excessive utilization of compounds comprising ester bonds, amide bonds, and glycosidic bonds, such as organophosphate pesticides (OPs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), poses grave threats to human health and ecosystem stability. There is an urgent need to develop efficient technologies for the precise detection and rapid degradation of these environmental pollutants. A promising approach to address this challenge is the engineering of hydrolytic nanozymes that emulate the active site structures and catalytic mechanisms of natural hydrolases. While the catalytic efficiency of existing hydrolytic nanozymes has yet to match that of natural enzymes, their capacity for detecting and degrading environmental pollutants has been significantly improved through activity regulation. This review systematically outlines the evolution of hydrolytic nanozymes, explaining their catalytic mechanisms based on classifications by the material composition and the types of chemical bonds in substrates. The analysis of activity regulation strategies is emphasized, encompassing the Lewis acid-base equilibrium at catalytic sites, modulation of the coordination microenvironment, enhancement of substrate selectivity, and design approaches driven by theoretical computations and data analysis, to advance the development of efficient hydrolytic nanozymes. The review also consolidates the potential of hydrolytic nanozymes in detecting and degrading environmental pollutants. Finally, this review assesses current challenges and prospects in this field, aiming to offer scientific insights into the rational design and environmental applications of hydrolytic nanozymes.
