You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic catalytic upgrading of spirulina bio-oil via Ni @ alkali-modified HZSM-5 in microwave-assisted two-stage hydrothermal liquefaction The urgent need to address global energy shortages and environmental pollution has accelerated the development of renewable algal bio-oils. Spirulina stands out as an ideal feedstock for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) owing to its high carbon sequestration rate, non-competition with arable land, and rich protein-lipid content. However, Spirulina-derived bio-oil typically suffers from high oxygen content and low heating value. To overcome these limitations, this study developed a microwave-assisted two-stage HTL process integrated with a Ni-loaded, alkali-modified HZSM-5 catalyst. Unlike conventional catalysts that often rely on costly noble metals or suffer from diffusion limitations in microporous structures, this system employs earth-abundant nickel on a hierarchically structured zeolite to enhance both cost-effectiveness and catalytic efficiency. HZSM-5 was treated with NaOH to create mesoporosity, followed by Ni impregnation to introduce hydrogenation functionality. The effects of NaOH concentration and Ni loading on catalyst properties were systematically investigated. Process optimization was performed via response surface methodology using a 3 % sulfuric acid medium, and bio-oil composition was analyzed by GC/MS. Modification with 1 mol/L NaOH increased hydrocarbon content to 32.9 %, while subsequent loading with 5 wt% Ni synergistically boosted the yield to 48.1 %. Molecular dynamics simulations provided mechanistic insights into bond cleavage and conversion pathways of Spirulina-derived model compounds in subcritical water. Compared with existing catalytic systems, this study significantly improves the quality of biofuels, providing an efficient catalytic strategy and fundamental insights for the production of high-quality bio-oil from spirulina.
