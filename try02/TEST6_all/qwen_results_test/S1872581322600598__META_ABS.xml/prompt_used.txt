You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of ash in biochar from carbonization by CO2-enhanced water leaching and its mechanism Ash content is an important factor affecting the quality and combustion performance of biochar. In this paper, a method of ash removal from biomass is proposed by carbonization followed by CO2-enhanced water leaching. The effects of the carbonization temperature of bagasse, the temperature and time of CO2-enhanced water leaching on the deashing were investigated. The results show that the deashing rate firstly increases and then decreases with the carbonization temperature, while the opposite trend is obtained with increasing the water leaching temperature and time. For bagasse biochar carbonized at 300 °C, the deashing rate reaches 57% at the water leaching temperature of 40 °C for 4 h. Compared with water leaching without carbonization, the proposed method can increase the content of fixed carbon and the char yield by 7% and 3%, respectively. It is because in the process of deashing, CO2 diffuses and dissolves into water to form carbonic acid which reacts with part of metal salts to form water-soluble salts, resulting in the removal rate of K, Na and Ca up to above 50%, and part removal of calcite and dolomite. Also, the proposed process shows higher deashing efficiency and universality, but the deashing degree is closely related to the ash composition and kinds in biochar. As to peanut shell and poplar, the deashing rate exceeds 30% by carbonization at 300 °C and CO2-enhanced water leaching at 40 °C for 4 h.
