You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-yield H2 production from HDPE through integrated pyrolysis and plasma-catalysis reforming process In order to deal with the ongoing rise in plastic trash and the decline in fossil energy, effective technologies for converting plastic to hydrogen are urgently needed. This work aims to explore the function of an emerging integrated pyrolysis and plasma-catalysis reforming system for hydrogen production from high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The results showed that plasma and catalyst had strong synergy for hydrogen production under various reforming temperatures, with a synergy effect of 250.98 % at 500 °C. The yields of total gas and hydrogen gas from the plasma-catalysis reforming of HDPE were 146.50 mmol/g and 102.52 mmol/g, respectively, which were more than three times the sum of the gas yields from the plasma-alone reforming process and the catalysis-alone reforming process. Characterization of used catalysts at 500 °C revealed that catalysts from plasma-catalysis reforming had more severe carbon deposition than those from catalysis reforming, because of the long whisker-like deposited carbon in plasma-catalysis mode that kept the surface Ni species exposed and therefore maintained improved stability and activity.
