Carbonization of anthracene in a batch reactor The coking of liquid anthracene in a batch tubular reactor was followed by measuring the formation of pyridine insolubles and the disappearance of anthracene as a function of time over the temperature range 465–525°C. Conditions, that can affect coking behavior and rates, like partition of the feed between liquid and vapor, agitation of the reactor, and whether the gas pressure in the reactor is autogeneous or imposed are considered. Carbonization primarily involves hydrogen-transfer reactions and condensation (polymerization) of free radicals into larger molecular weight species. Cleavage (cracking) of hydroaromatic species, giving smaller liquid and gas phase molecules, is at a minimum under the conditions used in this study.
