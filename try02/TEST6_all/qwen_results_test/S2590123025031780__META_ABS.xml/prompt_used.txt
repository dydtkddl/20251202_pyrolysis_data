You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Global insights into biomass pyrolysis mechanisms: A scientometric and mechanistic approach This review provides a comprehensive analysis of biomass pyrolysis by combining scientometric evaluation with mechanistic insight. The scientometric analysis, based on 174 articles retrieved from Scopus database, traced the evolution of biomass pyrolysis mechanism research from 1989, with significant growth observed from 2019 onwards. China, United States, and United Kingdom emerged as leading contributors in publication output, while China, United States, and Italy led in citation impact. Influential researchers such as Chen Hanping and Yang Haiping, along with key journals including Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, Fuel, and Energy & Fuels, have significantly shaped the field. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identified five major research themes: thermal decomposition and analytical techniques; co-pyrolysis and synergistic effects; catalytic pyrolysis and product analysis; component chemistry in biomass conversion; and reactor design and performance. The mechanistic analysis focused on the distinct thermal degradation behaviors of all the six biomass components, which underwent characteristic reactions such as dehydration, depolymerization, and decarboxylation, influencing the yield of pyrolysis products. By combining scientometric trends with mechanistic understanding, this study clarifies research evolution, key contributors, dominant themes, and reaction mechanisms in biomass pyrolysis. This review offers valuable guidance for researchers, industries, and policymakers working toward efficient biomass conversion, sustainable energy production, and environmental management.
