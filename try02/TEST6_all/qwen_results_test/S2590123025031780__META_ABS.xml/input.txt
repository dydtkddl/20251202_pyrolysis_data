Global insights into biomass pyrolysis mechanisms: A scientometric and mechanistic approach This review provides a comprehensive analysis of biomass pyrolysis by combining scientometric evaluation with mechanistic insight. The scientometric analysis, based on 174 articles retrieved from Scopus database, traced the evolution of biomass pyrolysis mechanism research from 1989, with significant growth observed from 2019 onwards. China, United States, and United Kingdom emerged as leading contributors in publication output, while China, United States, and Italy led in citation impact. Influential researchers such as Chen Hanping and Yang Haiping, along with key journals including Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, Fuel, and Energy & Fuels, have significantly shaped the field. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identified five major research themes: thermal decomposition and analytical techniques; co-pyrolysis and synergistic effects; catalytic pyrolysis and product analysis; component chemistry in biomass conversion; and reactor design and performance. The mechanistic analysis focused on the distinct thermal degradation behaviors of all the six biomass components, which underwent characteristic reactions such as dehydration, depolymerization, and decarboxylation, influencing the yield of pyrolysis products. By combining scientometric trends with mechanistic understanding, this study clarifies research evolution, key contributors, dominant themes, and reaction mechanisms in biomass pyrolysis. This review offers valuable guidance for researchers, industries, and policymakers working toward efficient biomass conversion, sustainable energy production, and environmental management.
