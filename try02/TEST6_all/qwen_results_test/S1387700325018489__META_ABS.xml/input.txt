Advances in Bi2O3-based photocatalysts: A review on synergistic modifications and wastewater treatment applications This review highlights recent designs aimed at improving the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers in Bi2O3 photocatalyst, a semiconductor type p, in the field of pollutant degradation. Bi2O3 materials are gaining popularity as photocatalysts over traditional TiO2 because they are effective under visible light, highly efficient, low-cost, and competitive. Their use has increased by a factor of three in the past five years. Bi2O3 materials exhibit various crystalline structures (monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, and triclinic) that lead to different physicochemical properties, including band gap energy and visible light activity. They can be easily synthesized through various methods, including precipitation, calcination, hydrothermal synthesis, combustion, sol-gel, spray pyrolysis, solvothermal synthesis, and green synthesis, resulting in diverse morphologies (e.g., rods, flowers, and nanotubes). Bi2O3 materials can be modified by adding metallic nanoparticles or doping with metal/non-metal oxides, as well as by creating heterostructures with other materials. Heterojunction types, including Type-I, Type-II, direct Z-scheme, metal-mediated Z-scheme, and S-scheme, have been developed to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3. These modifications have enhanced the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions for degrading pollutants in water, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dyes. They also produce hydrogen or inhibit bacterial growth, thereby reducing reaction times. Bi2O3-based materials present an effective and economical solution to environmental contamination and energy challenges. Their distinctive properties enhance performance while supporting sustainability efforts. By incorporating these materials into our strategies, we can significantly mitigate pollution and improve energy efficiency, thereby contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future.
