You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in Bi2O3-based photocatalysts: A review on synergistic modifications and wastewater treatment applications This review highlights recent designs aimed at improving the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers in Bi2O3 photocatalyst, a semiconductor type p, in the field of pollutant degradation. Bi2O3 materials are gaining popularity as photocatalysts over traditional TiO2 because they are effective under visible light, highly efficient, low-cost, and competitive. Their use has increased by a factor of three in the past five years. Bi2O3 materials exhibit various crystalline structures (monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, and triclinic) that lead to different physicochemical properties, including band gap energy and visible light activity. They can be easily synthesized through various methods, including precipitation, calcination, hydrothermal synthesis, combustion, sol-gel, spray pyrolysis, solvothermal synthesis, and green synthesis, resulting in diverse morphologies (e.g., rods, flowers, and nanotubes). Bi2O3 materials can be modified by adding metallic nanoparticles or doping with metal/non-metal oxides, as well as by creating heterostructures with other materials. Heterojunction types, including Type-I, Type-II, direct Z-scheme, metal-mediated Z-scheme, and S-scheme, have been developed to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3. These modifications have enhanced the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions for degrading pollutants in water, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dyes. They also produce hydrogen or inhibit bacterial growth, thereby reducing reaction times. Bi2O3-based materials present an effective and economical solution to environmental contamination and energy challenges. Their distinctive properties enhance performance while supporting sustainability efforts. By incorporating these materials into our strategies, we can significantly mitigate pollution and improve energy efficiency, thereby contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future.
