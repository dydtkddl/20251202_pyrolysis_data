Comprehensive insight into Cu-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol Catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol is a key strategy for mitigating climate change and promoting a sustainable methanol economy. In recent years, copper-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to their abundant reserves, low cost and excellent catalytic performance. This paper systematically reviews the latest progress of copper-based catalysts and deeply explores the process principles of carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol, covering multiple pathways such as direct hydrogenation, reforming, water-gas shift and carbon monoxide hydrogenation, and carboxylic acid intermediates. At the same time, the historical evolution of methanol synthesis catalysts and various preparation methods of copper-based catalysts are analyzed, their advantages and disadvantages and adjustment strategies are discussed, and methods for improving catalytic performance by introducing different supports and additives are introduced. In addition, the reaction mechanism of carbon dioxide-based methanol synthesis is explained, and the current status and challenges of industrial development are outlined, especially key issues such as demonstration projects, commercial operations, and carbon dioxide capture, green hydrogen source costs, and catalyst deactivation. Based on this, this paper proposes a series of suggestions for future research directions, aiming to improve catalyst performance, optimize operating conditions, and accelerate its commercialization process, so as to contribute to the realization of carbon neutrality goals.
