Research progress of electrically intensified catalytic processes: Internal resistance heating and electrical activation An urgent concern about energy dilemma and environment pollution has forced chemical industry to seek new intensification approaches. The development of renewable electricity has offered an attractive alternative. Joule heat generated on catalyst when electric current flowing through can directly drive catalytic reaction with minimized heat loss. In addition, an activation effect brought by the exogenous electric field is able to assistant catalysis, and thereby promote catalytic activity. This review highlights research progress of electrical intensification for catalytic processes through internal resistance heating and electrical activation. Basic principles of these two electrical intensification approaches have been introduced along with a summary about catalysts, preparation methods and reaction setup characterized in the new catalytic system. The catalytic performance of conductive catalyst as well as proposed activation mechanism are discussed to generate few suggestions about challenges and concerns need to be addressed in researches focused on electrical intensification, with an intention to benefit the development of this emerging field and facilitate decarburization of chemical engineering industry.
