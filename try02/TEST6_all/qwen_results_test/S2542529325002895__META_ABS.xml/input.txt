Additive manufacturing of metal lattice structures: A comprehensive review of technologies, mechanical properties, applications, and future trends Despite increasing research on Additive Manufacturing (AM) of metallic lattice structures, existing reviews predominantly focus on general overviews, lacking in-depth analysis of technology selection criteria, micro-mechanical mechanisms of multi-topology structures, and inherent trade-offs. This paper aims to fill this gap by systematically reviewing the process capability boundaries of three major technologies—Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electron Beam Melting (EBM), and Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS)—for manufacturing lattice structures. It also provides the first quantitative technology selection comparison tailored to performance requirements. Furthermore, this paper goes beyond conventional descriptions of lattice types, emphasizing an in-depth analysis of the paradigm shift in design from traditional trusses and plates to advanced topologies like triple-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS). It reveals their respective micro-mechanical behaviors, performance advantages, and failure mechanisms. Finally, this paper profoundly elucidates the intrinsic "process-microstructure-performance" relationship unique to additive manufacturing. It critically summarizes performance trade-offs such as "strength-ductility-toughness" arising from rapid solidification and thermal cycling, along with the dominant role of defects in anisotropic fatigue performance. Through case studies in aerospace and biomedical applications, this paper anticipates future trends including multi-material printing, intelligent control, and micro/nano lattices. It aims to provide a systematic theoretical framework and practical guidelines for the precise design and reliable manufacturing of high-performance lattice structures.
