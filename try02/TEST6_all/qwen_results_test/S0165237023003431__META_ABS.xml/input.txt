The decomposition mechanism of ethylene and modeling simulation during LDPE production: A comprehensive review and perspectives At present, the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was the main raw material for plastic production with the advantages of good corrosion resistance and wear resistance to fatigue. Ethylene was induced for producing LDPE under high temperature of 150–300 ℃ with high pressure of 200–300 MPa, and accompanied by the occurrence of combustion and explosion risk. This article probed into the mechanism of ethylene decomposition and the polymerization behavior of LDPE. Firstly, the polymerization and decomposition mechanism of ethylene was introduced, and the initiation mode as well as ignition energy were also discussed. Secondly, the decomposition product distribution, fouling mechanism in tube and decomposition conditions were analyzed emphatically in tubular reactor and autoclave reactor. In addition, the explosion characteristics of ethylene/LDPE two-phase system was also highlighted. Moreover, this paper expounded modeling simulation and validating computation for ethylene decomposition, molecular weight distribution as well as identification and reduction of contiguous hot spots. This study aimed to provide scientific research for scholars delved in ethylene decomposition field, and help to improve the intrinsic safety in LDPE production.
