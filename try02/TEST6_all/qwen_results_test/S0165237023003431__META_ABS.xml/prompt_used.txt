You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The decomposition mechanism of ethylene and modeling simulation during LDPE production: A comprehensive review and perspectives At present, the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was the main raw material for plastic production with the advantages of good corrosion resistance and wear resistance to fatigue. Ethylene was induced for producing LDPE under high temperature of 150–300 ℃ with high pressure of 200–300 MPa, and accompanied by the occurrence of combustion and explosion risk. This article probed into the mechanism of ethylene decomposition and the polymerization behavior of LDPE. Firstly, the polymerization and decomposition mechanism of ethylene was introduced, and the initiation mode as well as ignition energy were also discussed. Secondly, the decomposition product distribution, fouling mechanism in tube and decomposition conditions were analyzed emphatically in tubular reactor and autoclave reactor. In addition, the explosion characteristics of ethylene/LDPE two-phase system was also highlighted. Moreover, this paper expounded modeling simulation and validating computation for ethylene decomposition, molecular weight distribution as well as identification and reduction of contiguous hot spots. This study aimed to provide scientific research for scholars delved in ethylene decomposition field, and help to improve the intrinsic safety in LDPE production.
