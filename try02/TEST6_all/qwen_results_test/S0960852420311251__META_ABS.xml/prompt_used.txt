You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin over Lewis-acid catalyst niobium pentoxide and mechanism study Lewis-acid catalyst Nb2O5 is first applied in catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) to produce aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) that can be used as alternative liquid fuels. The catalyst exhibits a good talent to convert lignin into AHs with quite little polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation. The yield of AHs reaches 11.2 wt% and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) takes up 94% under the optimized condition (Catalyst to Lignin ratio 9:1, 650 °C). No coke is generated during the reactions. The reaction sequence is proposed and verified by model compound reactions. Furthermore, DFT calculations are performed to understand the mechanisms of limitation of PAHs or char/coke formation and the efficient deoxygenation ability over catalyst. Nb2O5 with Lewis acid sites is proved to be a promising catalyst for the production of AHs from lignin. This work provides a new idea on choice of catalysts for CFP of lignin in future.
