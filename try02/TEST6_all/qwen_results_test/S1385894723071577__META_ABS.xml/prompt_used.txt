You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of pretreatment with photocatalysis sequential coupling Fenton oxidation on physicochemical properties, pyrolysis behaviors, and product distribution of walnut shell Naturally occurring alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in biomass can adversely affect its pyrolysis behavior and product distribution and contribute to ash deposition in boilers. To address these challenges, we proposed a new idea of photocatalysis sequential coupling Fenton oxidation for biomass pretreatment. Our findings revealed that sequential pretreatment has the optimal moderating effects on biomass relative to individual photocatalysis and Fenton oxidation. The lignin and AAEMs in biomass were effectively reduced via sequential pretreatment, which was accompanied by cellulose content increased by 80.78% relative to untreated. Also, the slagging/fouling inclinations of biomass were successfully alleviated, and the pyrolysis performance was effectively improved. The kinetic parameters obtained based on the Coats-Redfern method can characterize the pyrolysis behavior well. During fast pyrolysis, sequential pretreatment caused the productivity of bio-oil was increased by 30.14% relative to untreated. In particular, the productivity of levoglucosan in bio-oil was increased by 364.71%. This study presented a novel and effective pretreatment strategy to improve the pyrolysis behavior and product distribution of biomass and alleviate ash deposition problems in boilers.
