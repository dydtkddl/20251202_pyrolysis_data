You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The fate of char structure and active groups in petroleum coke gasification in a drop tube furnace A research on the fate of active groups from three typical petroleum cokes (petcokes) during gasification in a drop tube furnace have been presented. The results showed that the relative reduction (R) index can be used to assess the gasification reactivity of petcoke. The decomposition of side chain reaction of dealkylation is easier to proceed. Petcoke with a relative ordered degree of char structure has an energy barrier resulting in the transformation from the ordered graphitic carbon structure to amorphous carbon structure occurred only after the temperature reaches 1200 °C. It is recommended to control the petcoke gasification temperature above 1200 °C. A high temperature is beneficial for the conversion of oxygen-containing functional groups to hydroxyl groups. Petcoke with high ash content promotes the decomposition of functional groups to form active radicals, which favors the formation of amorphous carbon and, consequently, more active sites resulting in the high gasification reactivity. The high temperature gasification can make the stable active radicals (aromatic hydrocarbons groups) to break up the thermal barrier and convert to active radicals (aliphatic hydrocarbons and side chains on aromatic structure, oxygen functional groups and hydroxyl groups). The active radicals react with oxygen adsorbed on the carbon surface to generate CO, H2, CH4, etc.
