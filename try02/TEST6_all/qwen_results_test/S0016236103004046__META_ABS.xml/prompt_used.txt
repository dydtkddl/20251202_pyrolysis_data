You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic modelling of VOC catalytic steam pyrolysis for tar abatement phenomena in gasification/pyrolysis technologies Tar elimination and hot-gas conditioning in thermochemical conversion processes, i.e. thermal gasification, pyrolysis of heterogeneous materials involved two main classes of catalysts and/or additives: metallic and mineral oxides. This communication focused on the experimental kinetic data on catalytic steam cracking of vaporized toluene (P C 7 H 8 =0.93–1.15 kPa, H 2 O/C 7 H 8=2.67 mol/mol, space-time τ=0.067–0.127 kgh (Nm 3)−1 ) as a tar-derived species and/or Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Toluene (C7H8) has been chosen as a model formula for reactive tar-derived one-ring species determined from tar constituents. Gaseous product distribution data were obtained at atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa), steam pyrolysis temperature range of 923–1223 K and GHSV 1200–2300Nm3 (m3 h)−1. The overall catalytic pyrolysis of toluene over a commercial available metal based catalyst NiMo/γ-Al2O3 was compared to the pyrolysis in presence of basic non-metallic mineral additives, i.e. Norwegian (Norsk Hydro) dolomitic magnesium oxide [MgO], Swedish low surface quicklime [CaO], and calcined dolomite [CaMg(O)2]. The operational conditions were applied without internal or external mass-transfer limitations. Kinetics for the pyrolysis could be described by first-order reactions for all the studied additives. The influence of hydrogen gas (30vol%, τ=0.150 kgh (Nm 3)−1 ) and water vapor (P H 2 O =4.51–21.41 kPa, τ=0.092–0.270 kgh (Nm 3)−1 ) in vaporized toluene cracking runs over low surface quicklime [CaO] was determined. A mechanistic model of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood type describing toluene decomposition was also developed.
