You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of components interaction during pressurized pyrolysis of biomass via ReaxFF MD simulation: Free radicals driven synergistic deoxygenation and polymerization reactions A deeper deoxygenation and upgrading of biomass could be realized through pressurized pyrolysis, whereas the product properties and reaction pathways from different biomass vary significantly, primarily due to components variations and interactions. This study employed reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) to elucidate co-pyrolysis mechanisms of biomass three components at microcosmic level. The effects of temperatures and pressure on individual component pyrolysis were initially investigated. Results indicated that pressure significantly impacted the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, particularly on cellulose, increasing its char yields at 1400–1800 K. The H2O and CO2 yields under pressure were markedly higher than atmospheric pressure. Moreover, by comparing calculated and simulated values, the influence of component interactions on product characteristics under atmospheric and pressurized conditions was analyzed. Simulation results showed that pressure enhanced component interactions, particularly between cellulose and lignin (C-L) at temperatures above 1700 K, with a maximum deviation of 13.97 % in char yields. The actual C2H2O2 and C3H4O3 yields were notably higher than calculated at 1800–2300 K, especially under pressure. C-L co-pressurized pyrolysis resulted in more -CO and -COOH groups removal as aldehyde and carboxylic acid small molecule volatiles. In contrast, cellulose-hemicellulose (C-H) interaction mainly occurred during volatiles secondary reaction at elevated temperature and pressure. These results are consistent with our existing experimental data. Ultimately, by tracking C, H, and O elements dynamic migration, a crucial “initiator” role of radicals in synergistic reactions was revealed. The work provides theoretical support for producing high-quality biochar via optimizing pressure conditions and components regulation.
