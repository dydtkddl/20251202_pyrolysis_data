Absorbed doses and radiation damage during the 11 years of LEP operation During the 11 years of operation of the large electron–positron collider (LEP), synchrotron radiation was emitted in the tunnel. This ionizing radiation induced degradation in organic insulators and structural materials, as well as in electronics. Annual dosimetric measurements have shown that the level of radiation increased with the ninth power of the beam energy. During the machine shutdowns and at the end of the operation, samples of rigid and flexible polymeric insulators (magnet-coil resins and cable insulations) were taken out and checked for their integrity. The test results are compared with the results obtained during the qualification of the materials, 12–15 years ago. At that time, lifetime predictions were made; they are now compared with the real time-aged materials.
