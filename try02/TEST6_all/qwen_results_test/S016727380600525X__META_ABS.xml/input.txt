Processing and microstructure characterization of ceria-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia powder and ceramics Cubic stabilized zirconia is a promising material as target for the transmutation of actinides in nuclear reactors. In this concept, actinides are incorporated into an inert matrix (zirconia) to form a solid solution. The present work is focused on the synthesis of 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia doped with 10 mol% ceria (10Ce–8YSZ) in which Ce is used to simulate the incorporation of tetravalent actinides. A wet chemical route powder synthesis method was applied to make homogeneous single-phase ceria-doped yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramics. The synthesis as well as the characterization of samples by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray emission Spectrometry (EDXS) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) is presented.
