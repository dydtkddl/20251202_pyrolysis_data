You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Response of the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) gut microbiome to diet shifts during polystyrene and polyethylene biodegradation Plastic biodegradation by mealworm is regarded as an emerging strategy for plastic disposal. In this study, the polystyrene (PS) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) degradation efficiency by yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae) supplemented with bran and the effects of plastics on the gut core microbiome were explored to construct a circular and continuous reactor for plastic biodegradation in the future. The gut microbiome was also investigated with dietary shift to explore the relationship between specific diets and gut microbes. The bran plus plastic (7:1 ratio, w/w) co-diet contributed to the mealworm survival and growth. The formation of −C˭O−/−C−O− groups in the plastic-fed mealworms frass represented the oxidation process of plastic biodegradation in the mealworm gut. The changes in molecular weights (Mw, Mn and Mz) of residual PS and LDPE in mealworms frass compared with that of PS and PE feedstock confirmed the plastic depolymerization and biodegradation. Lactobacillus and Mucispirillum were significantly associated with PE + bran diet compared to bran diet and PE diet, representing the response of mealworm gut microbiome to the bran and plastic mixture was distinguished from either bran or plastics alone. The gut microbiome changed substantially with the diet shift, indicating that microbial community assembly was a stochastic process and diverse plastic-degrading bacteria might occur in the mealworm gut.
