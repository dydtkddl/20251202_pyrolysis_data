You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and reactive molecular dynamic study on the oil-dispersible Pd nanoparticles for cracking aviation kerosene RP-3 Fully utilizing the chemical heat sink generated by hydrocarbon fuel cracking is critical for enhancing the endothermic cooling capacity of the fuel. In this study, a catalytic strategy based on oil-dispersible palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) is proposed for the supercritical cracking of RP-3. Pd NPs with an average size of 2.85 nm are synthesized and uniformly dispersed in RP-3, exhibiting long-term stability with a sedimentation rate below 7 % after 60 days. To evaluate the catalytic performance and reveal the complex catalytic cracking mechanism of hydrocarbon fuels under supercritical conditions, a combined approach of tubular reactor experiments and reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations is employed. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate that, compared to thermal cracking, Pd/RP-3 catalytic cracking exhibits significant improvements in conversion, gas yield, olefin selectivity, and heat sink. At 700 °C, 200 ppm Pd NPs increase the heat sink of RP-3 from 2.52 MJ/kg to 2.77 MJ/kg. Kinetic analysis reveals that the enhancement is ascribed to the remarkable catalytic abilities of Pd NPs to reduce the activation energies for RP-3 cracking, C-C and C-H bond cleavage by approximately 66.7 %, 80.7 %, and 78.7 %, respectively. Pd also enhances dehydrogenation reactions, leading to higher yields of hydrogen and olefins, while effectively facilitating benzene rings decomposition within the aromatic components of RP-3. The synthesized oil-dispersible Pd NPs present great potential for enhancing the cooling capacity and the catalytic cracking mechanism proposed here may provide a theoretical foundation for designing efficient future catalysts.
