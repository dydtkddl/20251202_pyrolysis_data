You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective cyclohexanol production from the renewable lignin derived phenolic chemicals catalyzed by Ni/MgO Selective production of cyclohexanol from renewable lignin derived phenolic has been presented using the cost-efficient catalyst Ni/MgO which shows excellent catalytic activity in the hydrogenation reaction and dehydroxylation inhibition. Guaiacol, one of the most abundant lignin depolymerization products, was selected as the model compound. The hydrogenation performance of guaiacol was investigated over various catalysts. The effect of the reaction parameters was also studied. The results showed that guaiacol could be efficiently converted to cyclohexanol, which is a highly value-added precursor and additive for bio-fuel that is generally obtained from unsustainable fossil resources. Under the mild condition (160°C, 3h and 3MPa H2), more than 97.74% of guaiacol conversion with 100% cyclohexanol selectivity can be achieved in the presence of 20% Ni/MgO. Intensive catalyst characterization demonstrated that the efficient promotion effect of the base carrier for the Ni active center was responsible for efficient guaiacol conversion and selective cyclohexanol production. Furthermore, the Ni/MgO catalyst showed excellent recyclability, where no significant activity loss was observed even after four runs. Moreover, the reaction pathway and the catalytic mechanism are proposed.
