You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Porous carbons produced by the pyrolysisof green onion leaves and their capacitive behavior Porous carbons were prepared by the simple carbonization of green onion leaves at temperatures from 600 to 800 °C and used as the electrode materials of supercapacitors. SEM, FESEM, EDX, AAS, XRD, TGA and nitrogen adsorption were used to characterize their morphology, pore structure and surface elemental composition. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge were carried out to evaluate their specific capacitance, resistance and cycling life. Results showed that the initial mineral elements present in the leaves such as calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) play an activating role during the carbonization. All samples have a bimodal pore distribution of micropores (mainly 0.6-1.2 nm) and mesopores (mainly 3-5 nm). The carbon prepared at 800 °C had the highest surface area of 551.7 m2 /g, a specific capacitance of 158.6 F/g at 0.2 A/g and an effective areal capacitance of 28.8 μF/cm2. The effective areal capacitance of the carbon prepared at 800 °C is higher than of most porous carbons reported in the literature, which is ascribed to its pore size distribution that favors ion access to its pores.
