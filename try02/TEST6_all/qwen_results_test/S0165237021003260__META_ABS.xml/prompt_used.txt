You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on kinetic study approach for pyrolysis of plastic wastes using thermogravimetric analysis The necessity of balancing in consumption and recycling process is evident to manage the life cycle of plastics wastes. Obtaining approaches for plastics degradation with the aim of energy recovery and produce value-added materials to close the waste loop gained attention in recent years and among, pyrolysis is the promising way to thermal degradation of plastics. Pyrolysis of plastics still lacks the proper design and kinetic background to target certain value added chemicals. Perspective knowledge of plastics degradation mechanism helps to select suitable kinetic models to fit the thermogravimetric data in which not only meet statistics parameters but can justify mechanistic chemistry of feedstock pyrolysis. Since thousands of reaction may occur during pyrolysis of polymers, reduction the number of reactions in moment model is essential, thus mechanistic chemistry models of typical polymers can be obtained by analyze of abundance of pyrolysis products. Thermogravimetric analysis is an effective way to quantify rates of devolatilization and several TGA curves at different heating rates and thermal schedule required to determine kinetic parameters. Different kinetic methods including isoconversional methods, model fitting and random scission are investigated in details for typical plastics. In this paper, comprehensive study on kinetic methods and models were carried out and deduct that using random scission model in combined kinetic method describe nearly real interpretation of waste plastics degradation. This route can shorten the path to design processes for pyrolysis of plastics wastes by performing different thermal schedules in TGA experiments including isothermal, constant heating rate sample controlled thermal analysis (SCTA).
