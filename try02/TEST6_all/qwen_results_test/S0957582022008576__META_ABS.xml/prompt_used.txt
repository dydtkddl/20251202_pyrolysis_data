You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel carbon adsorbent derived from iron-poisoned waste resin for phosphate removal from wastewater: Performance and mechanism In this study, a new Fe-rich carbon composite derived from iron-poisoned waste resin (WRC) was successfully prepared via pyrolysis-activation to remove phosphate from wastewater. The physicochemical properties of WRC were characterized using multiple characterization tools. The results showed that the WRC had a large specific surface area and was rich in metal loading for adsorption. Batch and fixed-bed experiments investigated the adsorption performance of WRC. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated from the Langmuir model was 17.43 mg/g at 298 K. Kinetics experiments showed that the adsorption of phosphate by WRC accorded with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The WRC could maintain excellent adsorption performance in a wide pH range of 2–12, suitable for various wastewater conditions. Meanwhile, the WRC had well anti-interference of common anions and humic acids on phosphate adsorption and WRC reuse performance. The mechanisms of phosphate adsorption by WRC were confirmed to be electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange and Lewis acid-base interaction. Fixed bed experiments were conducted for dynamic treatment of synthetic wastewater and actual wastewater, and the results indicated that WRC had potential application prospect. This study provides an economically feasible method for the phosphate removal from wastewater and achieves the reuse of waste resin.
