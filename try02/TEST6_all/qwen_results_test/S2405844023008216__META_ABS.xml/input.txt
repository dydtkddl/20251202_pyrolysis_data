Recent advancements in lignocellulose biomass-based carbon fiber: Synthesis, properties, and applications A growing need to reduce the global carbon footprint has prompted all sectors to make significant efforts in this direction. For example, there has been much focus on green carbon fiber sustainability. For example, it was found that the polyaromatic heteropolymer lignin might act as an intermediary in synthesising carbon fiber. Biomass is seen as a potential carbon accommodated solid natural sources that protects the nature and has a big overall supply and widespread distribution. With growing environmental concern in recent years, biomass has gained appeal as a raw material for production of carbon fibers. Especially, the positives of lignin material include its reasonable budget, sustainability, and higher carbon content, which makes it a dominating precursor. This review has examined a variety of bio precursors that help produce lignin and have higher lignin concentrations. In addition, there has been much research on plant sources, lignin types, factors affecting carbon fiber synthesis, spinning methods, stabilization, carbonization, and activation the characterisation techniques used for the lignin carbon fiber to comprehend the structure and features. In addition, an overview of the applications that use lignin carbon fiber has been provided.
