You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of activated carbon by microwave-assisted sulfuric acid activation for the adsorption of Congo Red in aqueous medium: Kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, molecular dynamic, and functional theory studies The effectiveness of functionalized activated carbon (AC) in removing organic contaminants from wastewater provides a novel approach to treating polluted water. In this study an AC is prepared from pomegranate peel waste using household microwave-assisted irradiation (donated as PPW-derived AC) for the removal of Congo Red (CR) from environmental water. The study is conducted in batch mode, with variations in adsorption process conditions including temperature, adsorbent mass, initial concentration, and contact time. The PPW-derived AC is characterized using several techniques, including XRD, FTIR, BET, zeta potential, and SEM. The adsorption of CR onto PPW-derived AC is evaluated using the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips models, with the Langmuir model providing the best fit and a maximum adsorption capacity of 26.93 mg g−1 at 40 °C. The adsorption kinetics are modeled using the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich models, with the Elovich and pseudo-second-order models providing the best descriptions of the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the adsorption thermodynamic parameters indicate that the process is endothermic and spontaneous. The theoretical concepts obtain from molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory calculations helped to identify the optimal configuration for CR dye adsorbed onto the AC surfaces, validating the experimental results. This study demonstrates that PPW-derived AC is an economical, attractive, and eco-friendly materials for dye pollutants removal.
