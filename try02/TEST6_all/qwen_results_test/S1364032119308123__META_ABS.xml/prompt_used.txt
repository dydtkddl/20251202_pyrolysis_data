You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study of fast pyrolysis, hydropyrolysis and catalytic hydropyrolysis of poplar sawdust and rice husk in a modified Py-GC/MS microreactor system: Insights into product distribution, quantum description and reaction mechanism Fast pyrolysis, hydropyrolysis and catalytic hydropyrolysis are three important methods to produce bio-oil from biomass and are of great interest to researchers. In this research, the comprehensive study of pyrolysis, hydropyrolysis and catalytic hydropyrolysis of poplar sawdust and rice husk was investigated in a modified laboratory Py-GC/MS microreactor system. Rh/ZrO2 (0.5 wt %) was prepared and applied in the catalytic hydropyrolysis process. An evaluation system including estimating method of product selectivity, the calculation method of O/C and H/C ratio, deoxygenation extent (DE) and hydrogen-loss extent (HLE), was established to fully measure the deoxygenation effect. The Rh/ZrO2-assisted catalytic hydropyrolysis showed a good deoxygenation effect as O/C ratios (0.10 for poplar sawdust, 0.11 for rice husk, respectively) are comparable to that of the reported upgraded bio-oil by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). The highest hydrocarbon selectivity of 49.14% and DE of 87.6% were obtained in catalytic hydropyrolysis of poplar sawdust. For rice husk, the hydropyrolysis process gained a similar DE (82.7%) to that of the catalytic HyPy (83.7%), because rice husk with high ash content (19.4 wt %) contains a large number of mineral elements that are likely to form a self-catalysis effect. The reaction mechanism was further inferred according to product distribution and quantum calculation of oxygen-containing products, suggesting that Rh/ZrO2-assisted hydropyrolysis was accomplished by multistage reactions, involving initial pyrolysis of raw biomass and further deoxygenation of the pyrolysis intermediates. Moreover, this work can also provide a proven methodology and theoretical supports for future studies on catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass.
