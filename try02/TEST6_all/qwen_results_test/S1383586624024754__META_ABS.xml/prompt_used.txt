You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient removal of toxic organics and reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) from tannery sludge: A comparative study of microwave pyrolysis and conventional pyrolysis The efficient and safe treatment of tannery sludge (TS) are causing significant concern. Pyrolysis stands as a pivotal technology in the realm of sludge treatment, offering the benefits of degrading organic matters within TS while simultaneously transforming the sludge into energy and other valuable substances. In order to develop an effective pyrolysis method with good resource recovery performance, this study employs microwave pyrolysis (MP) and conventional pyrolysis (CP) at temperatures ranging from 300 to 900 °C to investigate the transformation of chromium morphology. The results indicate that TS experienced a weight loss of 43 % during the pyrolysis process, with a combined average activation energy measured at 169.58 kJ/mol. MP, due to its more uniform and efficient heating, resulted in pronounced solid degradation, leading to increased pyrolysis gases. This enhanced the removal of organics at lower temperatures and contributed to the ring opening of aromatic hydrocarbons in the high-temperature segment. MP effectively reduced Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in TS, whereas CP showed relatively ineffective reduction of Cr(VI). Furthermore, metal compounds in TS treated by both MP and CP predominantly existed in the residue as FeCr2O4 and Cr2O3 at high temperatures. This suggests that more Cr(III) was immobilized in the pyrolysis residue. This study revalues the significance of MP as a promising treatment for TS, holding the potential for resource utilization.
