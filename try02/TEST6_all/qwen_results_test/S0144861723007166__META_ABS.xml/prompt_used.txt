You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Manipulation of crystallization nucleation and thermal degradation of PLA films by multi-morphologies CNC-ZnO nanoparticles Currently, the quest for more renewable and biodegradable materials is a scientific priority to address the problems of petroleum-based plastics are difficult to degrade. In this work, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) have been used as a template and four morphologies of CNC-ZnO nanocomposites were prepared via a hydrothermal method, and CNC-ZnO/polylactic acid (PLA) composite films were obtained by solution casting. We find that CNC-ZnO nanocomposites as heterogeneous nucleating agents improved the crystallinity and the film with flower-like CNC-ZnO was improved by 2.4 %. E a required for thermal degradation of the PLA films decreased to 66–81 % of that of neat PLA, calculated by the Kissinger method, the Friedman method, and the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method. The R2 model was the solid degradation mechanism of the PLA films, analyzed through the Coats-Redfern method and the Criado method. The H-bond content of the composite films was significantly reduced after thermal aging at 150 °C. We found that three-dimensional CNC-ZnO (ZnO-3) made more prominent contributions to the crystallization, thermal degradation, and thermal aging of PLA films than other dimensional. The thermal properties can be regulated by the dimension, size, and apparent morphology of CNC-ZnO nanoparticles.
