Liquid fuels and chemicals from pyrolysis of motorcycle tire waste: Product yields, compositions and related properties In this study, experiments have been conducted on the sample of solid motorcycle tire wastes to determine particularly the effect of temperature, feed size, and apparent vapor residence time on the pyrolysis product yields and their compositions. The maximum liquid yield of 49wt.% was obtained at a final pyrolysis temperature of 475°C, feed size 4cm3, with a residence time of 5s under N2 atmosphere in a fixed-bed fire-tube heating reactor system. The pyrolysis liquid products were characterized by elemental analysis and various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Chromatographic and spectroscopic studies on the liquids show that it can be used as liquid fuels and chemical feedstock, with a calorific value of 42.00MJ/kg and empirical formula of CH1.27O0.025N0.006.
