You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Composition of products from the pyrolysis of polyethylene and polystyrene in a closed batch reactor: Effects of temperature and residence time The compositions of the pyrolysis products of pure low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) and their mixtures have been investigated over a temperature range from 300 to 500°C. The pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a closed batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere to study the effects of reaction temperature and residence time. LDPE was thermally degraded to oil at 425°C however, beyond this temperature the proportion of oil product decreased as a result of its conversion to char and hydrocarbon gas. Compositional analysis of the oil products showed that aliphatic hydrocarbons were the major components, but the proportion of aromatic compounds increased at higher temperatures and residence times. On the other hand, PS degraded at around 350°C, mainly into a viscous dark-coloured oil. The formation of char only increased marginally until 425°C, but was dramatically enhanced at 450 and 500°C, reaching up to 30wt.%. The oil product from PS even at 350°C consisted almost entirely of aromatic compounds especially toluene, ethylbenzene and styrene. Under increasing temperatures and residence times, the oil product from PS was preferentially converted to char, while gas formation was preferred for the oil from LDPE. For instance at 500°C, PS produced about twice the amount of char obtained from LDPE indicating the role of aromatic compounds in char formation via condensation of the aromatic ring structure. During the co-pyrolysis of a 7:3 mixture of LDPE and PS, wax product was observed at 350°C leading to oil at 400°C, indicating that the presence of PS influenced the conversion of LDPE by lowering its degradation temperature. The mixture produced more oil and less char than the individual plastics at 450°C.
