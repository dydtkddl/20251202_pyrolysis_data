You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective guaiacol ethanol alkylation to produce pentaethylphenol on a WO3/HY catalyst The alkylation of lignin-derived phenolic monomers with alcohols is a key step in upgrading the lignin oil from lignin depolymerizations, yielding stable alkylphenols as final products with high heating value. In this work, ethanol alkylation of guaiacol is investigated with a Y zeolite-supported tungsten oxide catalyst, achieving a complete conversion of guaiacol and a 52 % total yield of alkylphenols. Based on monitoring the product distribution, a reasonable mechanism is proposed. Lower-grade ethyl-alkylated guaiacol and 2-ethoxyphenol are firstly produced, and their Ar-O bonds are readily cleaved when the number of ethyl groups attached to the benzene rings reaches or exceeds three, leading to the formation of higher alkylphenols. The catalyst characterization indicates that weak and medium-strong Lewis acidic sites are active sites, which promote the formation of carbocation intermediate for alkylation. An adsorption-desorption mechanism facilitated by the Lewis acid sites is also proposed. The interaction between oxygen functional groups and acid sites contributes to adsorption, while steric effects from ethyl groups promote desorption. The number of oxygen functional groups and ethyl groups significantly influences the adsorption-desorption process.
