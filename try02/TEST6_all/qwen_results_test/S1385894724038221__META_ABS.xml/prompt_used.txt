You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing bioenergy prospects of algal biomass and yard waste using an integrated hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis (HTC–PY): A detailed emission–to–ash characterization via diverse hyphenated analytical techniques and modelling strategies Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents a promising method for converting carbonaceous waste into renewable fuels, facilitating energy recovery. This study focuses on the HTC pretreatment of microalgae (Chlorella sorokiniana) and yard waste, examining their physicochemical structural changes, component migration, and potential for valorization via integrated HTC and pyrolysis processes. HTC notably enhances the carbon content while reducing oxygen and nitrogen levels in these feedstocks, producing a clean solid fuel with high energy density. The study investigates the pyrolytic behavior of hydrochars and their blends using different analytical techniques, kinetic modeling, and fixed–bed reactor experiments. The blends with 90% and 70% of microalgae hydrochar (CSH) exhibited the most significant synergistic effects during co–pyrolysis, evident in its devolatilization behaviors and reduced activation energies. Integrating artificial neural networks and response surface methodology models facilitated optimization of pyrolysis parameters and accurate prediction of bio–oil, biochar, and gas yields. The analytical techniques enabled characterization of pyrolysis products, revealing notable changes in bio–oil and biochar compositions, suggesting potential enhancements. The study comprehensively evaluates the HTC–pyrolysis approach’s potential for converting microalgae and lignocellulosic biomass into eco–friendly biofuels for industrial applications.
