Production of phenolic-enriched bio-oil from grape seeds residue: Effects of microwave pretreatment and catalytic pyrolysis The study investigated the microwave pretreatment of grape seeds (Vitis vinifera), followed by catalytic pyrolysis, to produce bio-oil enriched with phenolic compounds. The pretreatment was conducted under varying conditions of temperature (80–160 °C), pH (2–12), and power (300–900 W), using a Box-Behnken experimental design. The results indicated that neutral conditions (pH 7), a temperature of 160 °C, and low power (300 W) favored holocellulose removal, resulting in a higher concentration of reducing sugars (16.42 g L−1) and enrichment of bio-oil with phenols. The catalytic pyrolysis was carried out using catalysts developed with Nb2O5, LaCoO3, and either WO3 or MoO3. The catalyst containing MoO3 (Cat2542) demonstrated high selectivity for phenolic compounds, with a reduction in oxygenated compounds and an increase in the relative phenol content (93.46 %). The study highlighted the potential of using catalysts to improve bio-oil quality, making the process safer and more efficient, even in inert atmospheres. It was concluded that microwave pretreatment and the use of specific catalysts represent a promising approach for the valorization of residual biomass.
