You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of phenolic-enriched bio-oil from grape seeds residue: Effects of microwave pretreatment and catalytic pyrolysis The study investigated the microwave pretreatment of grape seeds (Vitis vinifera), followed by catalytic pyrolysis, to produce bio-oil enriched with phenolic compounds. The pretreatment was conducted under varying conditions of temperature (80–160 °C), pH (2–12), and power (300–900 W), using a Box-Behnken experimental design. The results indicated that neutral conditions (pH 7), a temperature of 160 °C, and low power (300 W) favored holocellulose removal, resulting in a higher concentration of reducing sugars (16.42 g L−1) and enrichment of bio-oil with phenols. The catalytic pyrolysis was carried out using catalysts developed with Nb2O5, LaCoO3, and either WO3 or MoO3. The catalyst containing MoO3 (Cat2542) demonstrated high selectivity for phenolic compounds, with a reduction in oxygenated compounds and an increase in the relative phenol content (93.46 %). The study highlighted the potential of using catalysts to improve bio-oil quality, making the process safer and more efficient, even in inert atmospheres. It was concluded that microwave pretreatment and the use of specific catalysts represent a promising approach for the valorization of residual biomass.
