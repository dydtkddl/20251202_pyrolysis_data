You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The solid recovered fuel Stabilat®: Characteristics and fluidised bed gasification tests The solid recovered fuel Stabilat® has a low water content which makes it ideal for thermochemical conversion processes such as gasification. The paper presents fuel characterisation and fluidised bed gasification experiments of the Stabilat® solid waste recovered fuel in two experimental facilities, aiming at assessing the product gas quality and bed agglomeration phenomena. The energy content of the gasification product gas was about 4.3MJNm−3 and the process efficiency reached the value of 64.4%. The amount of HCl measured in the product gas ranged between 61.0mgNm−3 (700°C, λ =0.25) and 37.6mgNm−3 (800°C, λ =0.3). The total tar content was found between 2 and 6gNm−3 according to the gravimetric method, while the same range with GC measurements was 4–13gNm−3 (N2 free). No severe loss of fluidisation occurred up to 850°C while electron microscopy investigation of the bed material and ash material revealed that some agglomerates were present, due to melting of glass particles inherent in the material while lower amount of ash and original bed material conglomerates. In all cases these phenomena did not cause any severe problems to fluidisation.
