Co-pyrolysis of beeswax with different consumer plastics for synergetic production of sustainable fuel oil Pyrolysis is one of the most popular recycling techniques for the valorization of plastic wastes into liquid/gaseous fuels as major products. However, the process is highly energy expensive and needs attention. In this context, four different kinds of waste plastics viz. polypropylene (PP), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Polystyrene (PS), and Polymethylene methacrylate (PMMA) are subjected to co-pyrolysis with beeswax in 1:1 proportion using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to reduce the energy requirement. The TGA data obtained are subjected to kinetic analysis by the first-order Coats- Redfern method. The addition of beeswax to plastics is found to significantly reduce the activation energy of the reaction, which is more pronounced in PS. Thermodynamic parameters of the thermal degradation of plastics are also found affected due to the blending of beeswax. The enthalpy value in the plastic-beeswax blend is found lower than that of from respective waste plastics. Gibbs free energies ranged between 2.011 × 105 and 1.722 × 105 J/mol for plastic and 2.041 × 105 to 1.791 × 105 J/mol for the blend. The co-pyrolysis of beeswax with plastics gives an overall improvement in the process.
