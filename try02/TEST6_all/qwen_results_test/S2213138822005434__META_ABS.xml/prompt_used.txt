You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of beeswax with different consumer plastics for synergetic production of sustainable fuel oil Pyrolysis is one of the most popular recycling techniques for the valorization of plastic wastes into liquid/gaseous fuels as major products. However, the process is highly energy expensive and needs attention. In this context, four different kinds of waste plastics viz. polypropylene (PP), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Polystyrene (PS), and Polymethylene methacrylate (PMMA) are subjected to co-pyrolysis with beeswax in 1:1 proportion using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to reduce the energy requirement. The TGA data obtained are subjected to kinetic analysis by the first-order Coats- Redfern method. The addition of beeswax to plastics is found to significantly reduce the activation energy of the reaction, which is more pronounced in PS. Thermodynamic parameters of the thermal degradation of plastics are also found affected due to the blending of beeswax. The enthalpy value in the plastic-beeswax blend is found lower than that of from respective waste plastics. Gibbs free energies ranged between 2.011 × 105 and 1.722 × 105 J/mol for plastic and 2.041 × 105 to 1.791 × 105 J/mol for the blend. The co-pyrolysis of beeswax with plastics gives an overall improvement in the process.
