You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecule editable 3D printed polymer-derived ceramics With the demand for advanced ceramics applied under harsh conditions, highly reliable ceramic components with customized structures and specific functions are in increasing demand. 3D printing can realize an integrated design of articles from macroscale to micro-/nanoscale, as it has outstanding design flexibility, near net-shape forming, and mold-free fabrication. However, traditional ceramic raw materials are usually ceramic powders, which are hard to meet the requirements of specific 3D printing techniques. Preceramic polymers as a special precursor are suitable for a series of forming methods including 3D printing, as they can be manipulated in polymeric phases. More importantly, the molecule of preceramic polymers are editable and designable, which can meet the requirements of various 3D printing techniques by molecule modification. Desired compositions and functions can be obtained by reacting with fillers and doping metals, realizing the integrated design of function and structure. This review investigated the polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) which are formed via 3D printing techniques. Differences between ceramic powders and preceramic polymers were presented, the superiority and drawbacks of the preceramic polymers were illustrated, which may facilitate the material selection, structure design, and fabrication of reliable and tailor-made 3D printed PDC components.
