Exploratory DSC investigation on the solvolytic depolymerization of PET in varied solvent systems and in the presence of model additives and contaminants Solvolytic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermo-chemical recycling route that valorizes plastic waste by recovering monomers and chemicals that can be reused for the synthesis of new polymers. This study focuses on neutral hydrolysis due to the potential environmental and economic benefits of water as depolymerization agent compared to alternative organic solvents. High-pressure crucibles were used as batch reactors in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to perform real-time monitoring of the thermodynamic phenomena taking place during solvolytic depolymerization of PET in varied solvent systems. PET melting point depression was found to be the main identified phenomena, with PET melting point exhibiting a drop of almost 30 °C in water and 50 °C in monoalcohol solvents like methanol and ethanol. Moreover, PET only underwent significant depolymerization prior to melting in NaOH containing systems. Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry were used to study the fate of model additives and contaminants under solvolytic conditions. The uncertainty concerning these foreign substances poses a challenge for the development of PET solvolytic technologies, and the methods here provided proved to be a fast-screening technique to quantify the conversion and identify potential degradation products of model additives like 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl) benzotriazole UV-stabilizer, 1-(methylamino) anthraquinone dye, and model contaminant (R)-(+)-limonene under hydrothermal conditions.
