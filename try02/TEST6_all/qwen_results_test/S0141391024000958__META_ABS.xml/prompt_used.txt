You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploratory DSC investigation on the solvolytic depolymerization of PET in varied solvent systems and in the presence of model additives and contaminants Solvolytic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermo-chemical recycling route that valorizes plastic waste by recovering monomers and chemicals that can be reused for the synthesis of new polymers. This study focuses on neutral hydrolysis due to the potential environmental and economic benefits of water as depolymerization agent compared to alternative organic solvents. High-pressure crucibles were used as batch reactors in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to perform real-time monitoring of the thermodynamic phenomena taking place during solvolytic depolymerization of PET in varied solvent systems. PET melting point depression was found to be the main identified phenomena, with PET melting point exhibiting a drop of almost 30 °C in water and 50 °C in monoalcohol solvents like methanol and ethanol. Moreover, PET only underwent significant depolymerization prior to melting in NaOH containing systems. Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry were used to study the fate of model additives and contaminants under solvolytic conditions. The uncertainty concerning these foreign substances poses a challenge for the development of PET solvolytic technologies, and the methods here provided proved to be a fast-screening technique to quantify the conversion and identify potential degradation products of model additives like 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl) benzotriazole UV-stabilizer, 1-(methylamino) anthraquinone dye, and model contaminant (R)-(+)-limonene under hydrothermal conditions.
