You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Glycerol: Its properties, polymer synthesis, and applications in starch based films Glycerol is the major by-product of the biodiesel production line. Every cycle of processing, yields ∼10% (w/w) of waste glycerol, and therefore, creates a glut in the glycerol market. The underutilized glycerol has undoubtedly increased the environmental liability. There are plenty of research focusing on discovering the effective glycerol utilization to produce value-added chemical commodity to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. This paper portrays the existing connection between glycerol and the polymer industry, particularly as a feedstock for polymer synthesis and its role as a plasticizer in the starch polymer. Glycerol is a potential bio-based material to afford prominent biocompatible yet biodegradable polymers for a variety of applications through direct polymerization, fermentation, and chemical conversion. Besides, glycerol plays a critical role in the food packaging industry to perform a plasticizing effect; it improves the ductility of the bio-derived packaging. The native unplasticized starch film is too brittle for handling, while the glycerol-plasticized starch film has adequate flexibility and processability, but with compromised water and gaseous barrier properties. Nevertheless, more established works should be published to exploit the use of this versatile base chemical in diverse fields to good advantages, yet reducing the adverse environmental impact.
