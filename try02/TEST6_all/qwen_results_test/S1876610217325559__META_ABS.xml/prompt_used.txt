You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the Effect of Polystyrene (PS) Waste Washing Process and Pyrolysis Temperature on (PS) Pyrolysis Product Quality Pyrolysis has been proposed as a viable processing route for recovering the organic compounds from polystyrene (PS) plastic wastes as fuels and chemical feedstock. In this study, PS plastic wastes were collected; some portion of them was washed in field-simulated laboratory scale system. Both washed and unwashed PS plastic waste samples were pyrolyzed at fixed bed reactor pyrolysis equipment. The pyrolysis process has been applied at 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700°C with 5°C/min heating rate. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and plastic washing process on the pyrolysis yields and solid, oil and gas products quality were investigated. The solid products (char) were characterized by FTIR and SEM. Oil and gas products were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The heat values were determined using an automatic calorimetric bomb. Pyrolysis oil products composed of heavy hydrocarbons (C10-C40). Heating values were found between 4300-4800 kCal. Pyrolysis gases of both wased and unwashed PS mainly contain gas samples contain pentene, pentane, hexane, benzene, heptane, toluene, octane, ethylbenzene and styrene. Each of these components has potential for use as fuel or as raw materials for various industrial processes after proper separation process.
