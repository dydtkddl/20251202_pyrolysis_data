You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the synthetic strategies of carbon dots and its Structure-Property interplay for Next-Generation technologies After carbon nanotubes, carbon nanosheets, and mesoporous carbon materials, carbon dots (CDs) have emerged. Due to theirs advantages such as easy synthesis, low cost, environmental friendliness, low toxicity, good stability, and good biocompatibility, CDs have shown enormous application potential in fields such as biological imaging, optoelectronics, anti-counterfeiting, sensing, energy conversion, and storage, and have received widespread attention worldwide, achieving significant research progress. This article provides a detailed overview of the development process of CDs over the past 10 years, with a focus on their synthesis schemes, structures-property relationships, as well as their important applications and technological prospects. A graphene based structural classification method was proposed, and the preparation plan and latest research progress were updated and summarized. Conduct in-depth research on synthesis strategies and structural characteristics, explore their structures-property relationships at the microstructural level, and analyze the fundamental reasons for their application in multiple fields. Through a comprehensive review of the latest research findings, the applications of CDs in the fields of environment, sensing, biology, energy conversion, and storage have been revealed. Revealed the current bottlenecks of CDs, such as fluorescence, stability, and absorbance. Finally, it also emphasizes effective ways to promote the development of next-generation CDs technology.
