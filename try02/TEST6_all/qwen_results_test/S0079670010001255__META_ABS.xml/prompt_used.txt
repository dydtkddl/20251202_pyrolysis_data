You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted polymer synthesis (MAPS) as a tool in biomaterials science: How new and how powerful Lack of reproducibility, difficult and expensive scale-up and standarization of synthetic processes are the main hurdles towards the industrial production of raw synthetic and semi-synthetic polymers for (bio)pharmaceutical applications. Time- and energy-consuming synthetic pathways that usually involve the use of volatile, flammable or toxic organic solvents are apparently cost-viable and environment-friendly for the synthesis at a laboratory scale. However, they are often not viable in industrial settings especially due to the impact they have on the product cost and the deleterious effect on the environment. This has presented hurdles to the incorporation of many new biomaterials displaying novel structural features into clinics. Nevertheless, owing to unique advantages such as shorter reaction times, higher yields, limited generation of by-products and relatively easy scale-up without detrimental effects, microwave-assisted organic synthesis has become an appealing synthetic tool. Regardless of these features, the use of microwave radiation in biomaterials science has been comparatively scarce. A growing interest in the basic aspects of the synthesis of either ceramic and polymeric biomaterials has been apparent during the last decade. This article reviews the most recent and prominent applications of MW as a versatile tool to synthesize and process organic and inorganic polymeric biomaterials, and discusses the unmet goals and the perspectives for a technology that probably has the potential to make biomaterials more accessible pharmaceutical excipients and the products that involve them more affordable to patients.
