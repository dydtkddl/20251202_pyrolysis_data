You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling of waste Geranium leaves into biochar for soil amendment Waste Geranium leaves (pre- and post-oil extraction) are scientifically screened as a bioresource for upcycling into biochar. The standard proximate analysis of the waste Geranium leaves indicated a fixed carbon content of ∼14–15 % by weight in them. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry are used to design the pyrolysis of the bioresource into biochar. The waste leaves are upcycled into respective biochar samples using pyrolysis at 600 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The standard ultimate analysis of the biochar samples indicated the presence of ∼63–68 % of total carbon by weight in them. A multitude of other characterizations of the biochar samples demonstrated that they are suitable for use as soil amendments. Different amounts of alkaline biochar samples are amended to the soil, and the biochar-amended alkaline soils are used to grow Rosemary plants. The Rosemary plants exhibited enhanced plant growth characteristics, including morphological (root and shoot lengths, and dry plant weight) and physiological (chlorophyll and nitrogen content) traits, which are attributed to the alkalinity of the biochar samples and the presence of oxygenated functional groups and mineral phases in them. This work elucidates a strategy for utilizing waste Geranium leaves as a valuable bioresource for producing biochar with added value.
