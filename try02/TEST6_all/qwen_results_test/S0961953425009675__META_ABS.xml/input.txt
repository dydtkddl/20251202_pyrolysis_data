Upcycling of waste Geranium leaves into biochar for soil amendment Waste Geranium leaves (pre- and post-oil extraction) are scientifically screened as a bioresource for upcycling into biochar. The standard proximate analysis of the waste Geranium leaves indicated a fixed carbon content of ∼14–15 % by weight in them. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry are used to design the pyrolysis of the bioresource into biochar. The waste leaves are upcycled into respective biochar samples using pyrolysis at 600 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The standard ultimate analysis of the biochar samples indicated the presence of ∼63–68 % of total carbon by weight in them. A multitude of other characterizations of the biochar samples demonstrated that they are suitable for use as soil amendments. Different amounts of alkaline biochar samples are amended to the soil, and the biochar-amended alkaline soils are used to grow Rosemary plants. The Rosemary plants exhibited enhanced plant growth characteristics, including morphological (root and shoot lengths, and dry plant weight) and physiological (chlorophyll and nitrogen content) traits, which are attributed to the alkalinity of the biochar samples and the presence of oxygenated functional groups and mineral phases in them. This work elucidates a strategy for utilizing waste Geranium leaves as a valuable bioresource for producing biochar with added value.
