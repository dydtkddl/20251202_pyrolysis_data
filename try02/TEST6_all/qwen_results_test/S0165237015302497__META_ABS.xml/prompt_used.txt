You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Rapid determination of anhydride content in trans-polyisoprene-graft-maleic anhydride by double-shot pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry A rapid method for determination of anhydride content in synthetic trans-polyisoprene-graft-maleic anhydride (sTPIgMA) by double-shot pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (DS-PyGC/MS) has been developed. The sample preparation step was minimized and samples were easy to handle. Dissolution of the polymer in toxic solvents could be avoided, and solid specimens containing unreacted MA monomer could be analyzed without purification. Unreacted MA monomer, residual solvent, and other volatile substances were eliminated from sTPIgMA during the thermal desorption step. In the subsequent pyrolysis step, grafted anhydride moieties were thermally decomposed to carbon dioxide and quantified. The content of grafted anhydride, measured by the DS-PyGC/MS method, was compared with the values obtained from conventional titration and FTIR methods. The determination of grafted anhydride content in sTPIgMA by DS-PyGC/MS was shown to be fast, simple, accurate, and repeatable.
