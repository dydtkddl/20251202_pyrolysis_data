You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of oxidative torrefaction on fuel and pelletizing properties of agricultural biomass in comparison with non-oxidative torrefaction Torrefaction is regarded as a promising way to improve the fuel properties of biomass. In this work, a typical agricultural biomass of cotton stalk with high supply availability was employed to reveal the correlation between torrefaction conditions and fuel quality as well as pelletizing property. Cotton stalk was torrefied at 220–300 °C with a wide oxygen concentration of 0%–21% using a fixed bed reactor. The fuel qualities of torrefied samples were analyzed and the pelletizing properties were investigated using a universal material testing machine. The results showed that both non-oxidative and oxidative torrefaction significantly improved the heating value at a maximum of 20.48%, while extreme conditions of 300 °C with 10%–21% concentration were avoided due to the excessive consumption of combustible substances. Four key pelletizing parameters, including pellet density, compressive strength, durability and hydrophobicity, were improved, while the energy consumption increased, mainly attributed to the reduction of hydrophilic functional groups and the increased friction force. Response surface methodology was introduced and it was indicated that the pelletizing properties were sensitive to the temperature, followed by oxygen. The operating conditions were optimized by central composite design and a torrefaction temperature of 260–270 °C with an oxygen concentration of 2%–3% were recommended to produce torrefied biomass pellet with good fuel and pelletizing properties.
