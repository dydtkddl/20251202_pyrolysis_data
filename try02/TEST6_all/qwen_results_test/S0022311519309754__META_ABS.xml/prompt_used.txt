You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The use of U3Si2/Al dispersion fuel for high power research reactors In order to investigate the irradiation performance of U3Si2/Al dispersion fuel at relatively aggressive reactor conditions, compared to how this fuel is typically used in a research or test reactor, post irradiation examination was performed on two fuel plates that were irradiated at ∼270 W/cm2 average surface heat flux and to a maximum local burnup greater than 8 × 1021 fissions/cm3 in the Advanced Test Reactor as part of the RERTR-8 experiment. As part of the non-destructive examinations that were performed on both fuel plates, detailed thickness measurements using a high-fidelity measurement bench were performed on one fuel plate and a segment of the second fuel plate. This paper provides the first reported results of such high-resolution thickness measurements for U3Si2/Al dispersion fuel plates, containing primarily the U3Si2 fuel phase, irradiated at such power levels to high burnup. For destructive examination using optical metallography, samples were generated from both irradiated plates. Localized regions of high swelling (characteristic of internal blistering) were observed on the surface of both fuel plates, suggesting that the performance limits had been reached for each plate. Destructive examinations showed that the fuel particles that are primarily U3Si2, which become amorphous during irradiation, in both plates contained relatively large fission gas bubbles with evidence of fission gas bubble interconnection.
