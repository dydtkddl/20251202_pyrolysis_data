The use of U3Si2/Al dispersion fuel for high power research reactors In order to investigate the irradiation performance of U3Si2/Al dispersion fuel at relatively aggressive reactor conditions, compared to how this fuel is typically used in a research or test reactor, post irradiation examination was performed on two fuel plates that were irradiated at ∼270 W/cm2 average surface heat flux and to a maximum local burnup greater than 8 × 1021 fissions/cm3 in the Advanced Test Reactor as part of the RERTR-8 experiment. As part of the non-destructive examinations that were performed on both fuel plates, detailed thickness measurements using a high-fidelity measurement bench were performed on one fuel plate and a segment of the second fuel plate. This paper provides the first reported results of such high-resolution thickness measurements for U3Si2/Al dispersion fuel plates, containing primarily the U3Si2 fuel phase, irradiated at such power levels to high burnup. For destructive examination using optical metallography, samples were generated from both irradiated plates. Localized regions of high swelling (characteristic of internal blistering) were observed on the surface of both fuel plates, suggesting that the performance limits had been reached for each plate. Destructive examinations showed that the fuel particles that are primarily U3Si2, which become amorphous during irradiation, in both plates contained relatively large fission gas bubbles with evidence of fission gas bubble interconnection.
