You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advancements in applications of ionic liquids in synthetic construction of heterocyclic scaffolds: A spotlight Heterocycles constitute the integral part of the most of United States food and drug administration (USFDA) approved drugs. Over the past decade, ionic liquids have emerged as a clean, efficient and environmentally benign alternative to the hazardous volatile organic solvents in addition to numerous other remarkable applications owing to their renewability, biodegradability, abundance and inexpensive nature. These properties could be finely tuned based on the demand of several applications in chemical transformations through alteration of their compositional counterparts such as; anions and cations. The current work emphasizes the significant insights into the undisputable applications of these ionic liquids such as catalyst, solvent, co-solvent, ligand in homo and heterogeneous reactions and their use as support in several synthetic transformations. Significant efforts have been made to provide critical inputs on the mechanistic insights such as hydrogen bond formation, amphiphilic electrophile-nucleophile dual activation, bifunctional catalysis, phase-transfer catalysis, and organocatalysis for ionic liquid catalyzed organic transformation. Additionally, the present comprehensive and critical review shall help the reader to select the suitable ILs for synthesizing of desired heterocycles. The present review shall focus on recent advancements and applications of ionic liquids as solvent and catalysts in the synthesis of heterocycles reported from 2013 to 2020.
