You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrathin-graphite foam with high mechanical resilience and electroconductibility fabricated through morphology-controlled solid-state pyrolysis of polyaniline foam Three-dimensional carbon-based foam (3D-CF) possesses many fascinating properties such as giant conductivity, high thermal insulation, outstanding mechanical performance, and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. However, most 3D-CFs acquired by the previously reported fabrication methods have some limitations, such as uncontrollable morphology, plenty of inherent defects, difficult to realize self-standing after removing sacrificial template, and overlapping joint flaws among graphene layers. Although significant research efforts have been devoted to develop 3D foam, it is still a challenging task to obtain 3D-CF with both high conductivity and outstanding mechanical performance, simultaneously. To address this issue, a novel and easy fabricating approach for 3D ultrathin-graphite carbon foam (3D-UGF) was explored by a morphology-retaining pyrolysis of polyaniline foam precursors. The typical 3D-UGF graphitized at 2800 °C exhibited stronger compressive strength and electrical conductivity under the compressive strain of 90%, and remained constant even after 2000 cycles, which are comparable to the previously reported state-of-the-art 3D-CF foam with the same density. Cycling performance of the lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries with the 3D-UGF as binder-free cathode is as high as 1590 mAh g−1 and 920 mAh g−1 after deep discharge/charge 100 cycles, respectively.
