You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic modeling of the thermal cracking of methylcyclohexane near atmospheric pressure, from 523 to 1273K: Identification of aromatization pathways A kinetic model consisting of 1216 free-radical and 87 molecular reactions and implying 239 species was developed to describe the thermal cracking of methylcyclohexane. The primary mechanism was built in a systematic manner in order to be very detailed and a partial secondary mechanism was also included. The model was tested against experimental published data on large range of temperature (723–1192K) and conversion (up to more than 90%), near atmospheric pressure. The model appeared robust enough to be simulated in a larger range of temperature (523–1273K) in order to identify the main consumption and production pathways, in particular the aromatization pathways vs. temperature. In our conditions, the aromatic compounds are mainly formed by dehydrogenation and dealkylation reactions of cyclohexene and alkylcyclohexenes, whatever the temperature. So, the key-point is the formation of cyclohexene and alkylcyclohexenes. It was shown that, at high temperature, they are exclusively formed by free-radical reactions which decompositions by β-scission of CC and CH bonds. At low temperature, the molecular Diels–Alder reactions become the predominant pathway and the reasons were identified.
