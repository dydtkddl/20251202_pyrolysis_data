Multi-criteria evaluation of slurry fuels based on coal and organic waste The applicability of slurry fuels for power generation by direct combustion was assessed using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Slurry fuels based on coal slime and water with 5 % additive of biomass waste (rice husk, sawdust and sewage sludge) were studied. was experimentally established that the use of biomass waste in the composition of slurry fuel improves the characteristics of sedimentation stability by 2.5–4.2 times, atomization parameters by 1.5–2.0 times and environmental indicators of the combustion process by 1.5–2.4 times. A multi-criteria assessment of the efficiency of using slurry fuels in comparison with widely used solid fossil fuels in thermal power engineering was carried out based on the obtained experimental results. The indicators of the highest relative efficiency for slurry fuels with additives of sewage sludge and rice husk in the temperature range of 700–900 °C are 10–12 % higher than for the composition without additives.
