You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of PVC: A review This review summarized various chemical recycling methods for PVC, such as pyrolysis, catalytic dechlorination and hydrothermal treatment, with a view to solving the problem of energy crisis and the impact of environmental degradation of PVC. Emphasis was paid on the recent progress on the pyrolysis of PVC, including co-pyrolysis of PVC with biomass/coal and other plastics, catalytic dechlorination of raw PVC or Cl-containing oil and hydrothermal treatment using subcritical and supercritical water. Understanding the advantage and disadvantage of these treatment methods can be beneficial for treating PVC properly. The dehydrochlorination of PVC mainly happed at low temperature of 250–320°C. The process of PVC dehydrochlorination can catalyze and accelerate the biomass pyrolysis. The intermediates from dehydrochlorination stage of PVC can increase char yield of co-pyrolysis of PVC with PP/PE/PS. For the catalytic degradation and dechlorination of PVC, metal oxides catalysts mainly acted as adsorbents for the evolved HCl or as inhibitors of HCl formation depending on their basicity, while zeolites and noble metal catalysts can produce lighter oil, depending the total number of acid sites and the number of accessible acidic sites. For hydrothermal treatment, PVC decomposed through three stages. In the first region (T <250°C), PVC went through dehydrochlorination to form polyene; in the second region (250°C< T <350°C), polyene decomposed to low-molecular weight compounds; in the third region (350°C< T), polyene further decomposed into a large amount of low-molecular weight compounds.
