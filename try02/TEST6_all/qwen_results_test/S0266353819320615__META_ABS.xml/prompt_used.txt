You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneously enhance thermal conductive property and mechanical properties of silicon rubber composites by introducing ultrafine Al2O3 nanospheres prepared via thermal plasma It is great significant to develop polymer composites with high thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical properties simultaneously. Generally, a high loading of fillers is required for thermal conductive composites. However, traditional polymer composites exhibit unsatisfactory enhancement due to poor dispersion and weak interfacial adhesion, for which lead to high interfacial resistance. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of composites are greatly damaged because of internal defects caused by imperfect filling. Herein, Al2O3 nanospheres prepared by high frequency thermal plasma are first used as filler to increase thermal conductivity of silicon rubber (SR) and reinforce the mechanical properties of SR. The Al2O3 nanospheres show good compatibility and strong interfacial adhesion with matrix. Thus SR composites exhibit excellent thermal conductivity of 1.53 Wm−1K−1, corresponding to an enhancement of 665% compared to SR. Importantly, the SR composites still possess high tensile strength of 5.71 MPa, modulus of 9.69 MPa and fracture toughness of 1.81 MJ/m3 respectively, improving by 1630%, 3360% and 723% compared with neat SR. In addition, The Al2O3/SR composites also possess good dielectric properties, high volume resistivity and enhanced thermal stability, indicating a promising application of composites in the field of electronic packing. Therefore, this work offers a novel route to design high performance SR composites using Al2O3 nanospheres prepared by thermal plasma.
