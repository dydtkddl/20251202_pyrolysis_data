You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of fuel particle size on gasification in a dual fluidized bed steam gasifier The influence of the distribution of fuel particle size on steam gasification was studied systematically in a dual fluidized bed gasifier. Pilot plant gasification experiments have been conducted using sawdust and pellets produced from the same raw material. Three different kinds of waste wood with a broad particle size distribution were also considered for comparison. The fuels differ in their content of particles smaller than 1mm of equivalent diameter. With an increasing proportion of particles smaller than 1mm, the product gas contained less H2 and more CO and CH4. Less product gas was generated and the concentration of tar increased. It is observed that entrainment of small fuel particles plays an important role in the dual fluidized bed gasifier. Based on the superficial gas velocity in the freeboard of the gasification reactor, a limiting diameter for the entrainment of fuel particles can be determined. Under the conditions investigated a total of 22wt.% of fuel particles present in the mixture of sawdust and pellets was entrained very rapidly after feeding because of their size. They mainly devolatilize in the freeboard and only have limited contact with the catalytic bed material. Therefore, these volatiles are less likely to be reformed and more tar is found in the product gas. As a conclusion, the particle size determines the region where the thermal conversion of the fuel particle mainly takes place: within the fluidized bed or in the freeboard.
