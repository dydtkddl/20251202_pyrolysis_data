You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Layered nanoreactor assisted to produce B-doped and P-doped 3D carbon nanostructures for supercapacitor electrodes In the use of the electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) with carbon electrode materials, what remains an important technological challenge is that existing carbon electrodes suffer from low energy density and low volumetric capacitance, the today's need for making energy storage architectures. The incorporation of the n-type and/or p-type dopant elements in carbon structure may result in an enhancement in the capacitance. Accordingly, the idea to use the layered nanoreactors was applied to produce phosphorous-doped and boron-doped porous carbon nanostructures with high specific capacitance (CS ) values when used in supercapacitor electrodes. So that, the best P-doped and B-doped carbon electrodes show the CS values of 322 and 275 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 1 A/g in the three-electrode system. A symmetric supercapacitor device made using the best doped carbon material (CG-P) showed a CS value of 163.2 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. Herein, this work shows that the high values of CS for carbon materials are due to high accessible surface area, excellent pore size distribution, the presence and uniform dispersion of the dopant agents in carbon structures.
