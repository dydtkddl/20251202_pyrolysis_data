You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of thermal behavior of pine sawdust and coal during co-pyrolysis and co-combustion Nowadays, most of the recent large-scale installations are configured to use more than one fuel. Thermal analysis allows us to properly design and operate especially such a large-scale co-pyrolysis and/or co-combustion process. In this study, thermal behaviours of pine sawdust (PS), coals, and their blends were investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen and air atmospheres with different heating rates of 10, 20, and 40 °C min-1. Kinetic parameter such as activation energy (Ea) was calculated by using Kissenger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), and Starink models. The results showed the existence of an obvious synergistic effect between PS and coal during pyrolysis and combustion processes. The initial, maximum, and burnout temperatures of the reactions; the mass loss rate; and total mass loss were influenced by the proportions of PS and coal in the blend. For pyrolysis the average Ea of 25PS calculated by KAS, FWO, and Starink models was found as 31.57, 40.45, and 32.55 while that of 50PS was 166.80, 168.64, and 167.25 kJ mol-1, respectively. For combustion, the average Ea of 25PS calculated by KAS, FWO, and Starink models was found as 59.57, 67.74, and 60.52 while that of 50PS was 66.60, 74.20, and 67.49 kJ mol−1, respectively. According to the Ea value, the blend of 25PS was more suitable than 50PS for energy production through both pyrolysis and combustion. This synergistic effect between PS and coal may be further detailed with more different blend ratios.
