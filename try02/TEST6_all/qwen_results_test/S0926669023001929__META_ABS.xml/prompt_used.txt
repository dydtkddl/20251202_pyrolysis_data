You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the synergistic reaction mechanism of biomass pseudocomponents and polyamide by TG-MS and Py-GC/MS: Pyrolysis properties, reaction kinetics and N-containing species evolution To unveil the nitrogen migration and conversion characteristics, catalytic copyrolysis of biomass pseudo components and polyamide (PA) with different blend ratios (1:0, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 0:1) under an ammonia atmosphere was proposed to boost the yield of N-containing compounds (NCCs) and N-rich biochar. The evolution and distribution of NCCs in liquid, gas and biochar were systematically investigated with a combination of TG-MS, Py-GC/MS and EPR. Synergistic effects and possible reaction pathways were also evaluated. Experimental results showed that PA could obviously boost biomass conversion due to increasing the chance of secondary cleavage, and the comprehensive synergistic effect of biomass-derived H* radicals, acid sites of the catalyst and cracking reactions (-C-N and C-C bonds) that reduced the reaction energy barrier and enhanced the NH3 and HCN yields. NH3 comes from the amino acids that are released from the amino acid pyrolysis and hydrolysis of HCN on the surface of char, while HCN is from the secondary cracking of primary pyrolysis products. Adding biomass increased CO2, CO, CH4, C-O and CO emissions from co-pyrolysis. Additionally, significant synergetic effects were observed when Biomass/PA= 3:1, which improved the NCCs and pyridine yields by 78.58% and 48.23%, respectively, under the HZSM-5 catalyst. A lower proportion of PA addition facilitated the Maillard reaction and amide bond cleavage to enhance the NCCs content and suppressed π-conjugated ring structure compound evolution and coke-derived O-containing compound polymerization, while a higher content of PA was favorable for amine and diaza heterocycle compound formation. Moreover, the addition of PA reduced the HHV and N content in biochar, resulting in lower pyrrole-N content and graphitization degree due to secondary cross-polymerization reaction of reaction volatiles, but it enhanced the polarity due to higher oxygen content (14.98%).
