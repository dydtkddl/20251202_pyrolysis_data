You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in the processing, sterilization, and crosslinking of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for total joint arthroplasty Despite the recognized success and worldwide acceptance of total joint arthroplasty, wear is a major obstacle limiting the longevity of implanted UHMWPE components. Efforts to solve the wear problem in UHMWPE have spurred numerous detailed studies into the structure, morphology, and mechanical properties of the polymer at every stage of its production from original resin into stock material and final fabricated form. Scientific developments in this field are occurring at an accelerating rate, and periodic review of UHMWPE technology is therefore increasingly necessary. The present article provides a four-part comprehensive review of technological advancements in the processing, manufacture, sterilization, and crosslinking of UHMWPE for total joint replacements. The first part of this article describes the recently updated nomenclature of UHMWPE, including the process of resin production and conversion to stock material. The second part outlines the methods of manufacturing UHMWPE into joint replacement components and provides overviews of alternate forms of UHMWPE, namely carbon-fiber reinforced UHMWPE (Poly II™) and UHMWPE recrystallized under high temperature and pressure (Hylamer™). The third part summarizes the sterilization and degradation of UHMWPE. Newly developed methods for accelerating the oxidation of UHMWPE after sterilization (for preconditioning of test specimens), as well as methods for quantifying the oxidation of UHMWPE, are also discussed. Finally, the fourth part reviews the development and properties of crosslinked UHMWPE, a promising alternate biomaterial for total joint replacements.
