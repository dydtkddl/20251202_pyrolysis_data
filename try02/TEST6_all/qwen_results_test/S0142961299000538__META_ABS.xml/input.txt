Advances in the processing, sterilization, and crosslinking of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for total joint arthroplasty Despite the recognized success and worldwide acceptance of total joint arthroplasty, wear is a major obstacle limiting the longevity of implanted UHMWPE components. Efforts to solve the wear problem in UHMWPE have spurred numerous detailed studies into the structure, morphology, and mechanical properties of the polymer at every stage of its production from original resin into stock material and final fabricated form. Scientific developments in this field are occurring at an accelerating rate, and periodic review of UHMWPE technology is therefore increasingly necessary. The present article provides a four-part comprehensive review of technological advancements in the processing, manufacture, sterilization, and crosslinking of UHMWPE for total joint replacements. The first part of this article describes the recently updated nomenclature of UHMWPE, including the process of resin production and conversion to stock material. The second part outlines the methods of manufacturing UHMWPE into joint replacement components and provides overviews of alternate forms of UHMWPE, namely carbon-fiber reinforced UHMWPE (Poly II™) and UHMWPE recrystallized under high temperature and pressure (Hylamer™). The third part summarizes the sterilization and degradation of UHMWPE. Newly developed methods for accelerating the oxidation of UHMWPE after sterilization (for preconditioning of test specimens), as well as methods for quantifying the oxidation of UHMWPE, are also discussed. Finally, the fourth part reviews the development and properties of crosslinked UHMWPE, a promising alternate biomaterial for total joint replacements.
