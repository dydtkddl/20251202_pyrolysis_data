You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption of phenol and chlorophenols from aqueous solution by modified elutrilithes Modified elutdlithes were prepared by treating natural sample with calcium chloride or zinc chloride. Natural and treated products (Ca-Elut and Zn-Elut) were examined for their adsorptive properties towards phenol and several of its chlorinated congeners. The modified elutrilithes show, in contrary to the natural forms, a high adsorption capacity and high affinity for these organic compounds. The adsorption of the phenols from aqueous solution can be related to their hydrophobicities. Indeed the adsorption capacities and affinities can be related to the number of chlorine atoms on the phenol structure, phenol < chlorophenol < dichlorophenol < trichlorophenol. Hence, the adsorption capacity was not limited by the molecular size of the adsorbate. For the Zn-Elut adsorbent, the adsorption of phenols increases with increasing the pH of the aqueous solution. Maximal adsorption was observed at a pH close to the pKa of the adsorbate, and decreases sharply at larger pH values. The temperature, however, has a small influence on the phenols adsorption on Zn-Elut. In general, the adsorption of phenols increases with decreasing temperature. The strong bond between the phenols and the modified elutrilithes causes the high affinity (type-I adsorption isotherm according to the Langmuir model, indicating a homogeneity of the adsorption sites on modified elutrilithes). Furthermore, the adsorption-desorption experiments demonstrated that the 3,5-dichlorophenol adsorption on Zn-Elut was a irreversible process. Between the two modified elutrilithes investigated, Zn-Elut exhibited larger adsorption capacities for phenols and was superior to modified clay materials.
