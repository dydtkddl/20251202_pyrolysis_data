You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation, characterization, and applications of Fe-based catalysts in advanced oxidation processes for organics removal: A review Fe-based catalysts as low-cost, high-efficiency, and non-toxic materials display superior catalytic performances in activating hydrogen peroxide, persulfate (PS), peracetic acid (PAA), percarbonate (PC), and ozone to degrade organic contaminants in aqueous solutions. They mainly include ferrous salts, zero-valent iron, iron-metal composites, iron sulfides, iron oxyhydroxides, iron oxides, and supported iron-based catalysts, which have been widely applied in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, there is lack of a comprehensive review systematically reporting their synthesis, characterization, and applications. It is imperative to evaluate the catalytic performances of various Fe-based catalysts in diverse AOPs systems and reveal the activation mechanisms of different oxidants by Fe-based catalysts. This work detailedly summarizes the synthesis methods and characterization technologies of Fe-based catalysts. This paper critically evaluates the catalytic performances of Fe-based catalysts in diverse AOPs systems. The effects of solution pH, reaction temperature, coexisting ions, oxidant concentration, catalyst dosage, and external energy on the degradation of organic contaminants in the Fe-based catalyst/oxidant systems and the stability of Fe-based catalysts are also discussed. The activation mechanisms of various oxidants and the degradation pathways of organic contaminants in the Fe-based catalyst/oxidant systems are revealed by a series of novel detection methods and characterization technologies. Future research prospects on the potential preparation means of Fe-based catalysts, practical applications, assistive technologies, and impact in AOPs are proposed.
