Insight into high-temperature fast pyrolysis characterization, product distribution and interaction effect of municipal solid waste and its components under steam-containing hydrogen-rich syngas atmosphere This research delves into the field of fast hydropyrolysis of mixed municipal solid waste (MSW), with the goal of understanding product distribution and interactions in a hydrogen-rich condition. Through experimental investigations on MSW and its components, this study thoroughly examines the impact of pyrolysis temperature and gasification atmosphere (30 % H2+30 % CO+20 % CO2+20 % H2O) on the yields and distribution of the three-phase products. As the temperature increases, the gas yield gradually increases, while the yields of tar and char gradually decrease. The introduction of a hydrogen source increases the methane content in the combustible gas, which generally reaches its maximum at 850 °C, and promotes aromatic formation in tar, making aromatics the main component of pyrolysis oil. Notably, aromatics have the highest-octane number in gasoline. This study highlights gasification as a promising technology for converting organic waste into valuable fuel, advancing waste management and energy recovery.
