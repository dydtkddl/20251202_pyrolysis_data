You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of gasoline-like transportation fuel obtained by plastic waste pyrolysis and distillation Gasoline-like hydrocarbon products obtained from the distillation of different pyrolysis oils produced from solid wastes of polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and their blends were investigated as these materials together form a good candidate for providing gasoline with properties approaching or fulfilling standard requirements in various countries. A laboratory-scale batch reactor equipped with reflux was used in this research, while the gasoline fractions of pyrolysis oils processed by distillation were further analyzed by GC-MS. Fuel density, volatility, distillation curves, olefin content, aromatics (including benzene) content, and oxygenates were analyzed, and various scenarios were proposed for reaching standard quality. The results were compared to a commercial gasoline sample from Hungary. It was found that the gasoline-like product of low-density PE (LDPE) and high-density PE (HDPE) showed the most similarities to standard requirements regarding molecular distribution. The PS produced mainly aromatics, while the gasoline yield of PP contained 53.5 vol% 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, which severely affects the distillation requirements presented by gasoline fuel standards. The results show that the mass ratio of plastic materials used in the pyrolysis process can heavily influence the oil products’ applicability as a transportation fuel. The optimal plastic waste mixture combined with the saturation of the olefin content by catalytic hydrogenation can provide standard-quality gasoline.
