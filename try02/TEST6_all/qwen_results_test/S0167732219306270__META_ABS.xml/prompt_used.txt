You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbonization of Co-BDC MOF results in magnetic C@Co nanoparticles that catalyze the reduction of methyl orange and 4-nitrophenol in water Herein we report a simple, facile and green technique for the preparation of magnetic cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) embedded on porous carbon (C@Co) nanocatalyst using MOFs template and explored for the catalytic reduction of Methyl orange (MO) and 4-Nitrophenol (4-NP). The morphology, structure and composition of the nanocatalyst were characterized by using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) techniques. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of metallic Co NPs as well as their high crystalline structure. TEM analysis revealed that all the Co NPs are wrapped and protected by the porous carbon matrix. Catalytic studies revealed that the prepared magnetic C@Co nanocatalyst could catalyze the reduction of MO and 4-NP in 2 min effectively. Furthermore, the nanocatalyst showed an outstanding reusability and recyclability characteristics that remained unchanged even after several cycles. Consequently, this research offers a highly active, recyclable and magnetically isolable nanocatalyst, which can be utilized for many catalytic industrial processes. In this regard, the magnetic C@Co nanocatalyst could be a potential candidate for the wastewater treatment.
