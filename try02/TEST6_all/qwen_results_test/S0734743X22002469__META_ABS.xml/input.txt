A review on Shock tubes with multitudinous applications Shock tubes simulate jet aerodynamics and investigate the behavior of high-temperature materials, which has significantly evolved since 1899. This article examines the changes in testing techniques applied since 2000. Researchers working on biological applications, species detection, time history prediction, chemical kinetics of fuels and gasses, fuel ignition delay timings and detonation, and ballistic testing of armor and protective gear customised the shock tube to match their demands. Materials for re-entry vehicles and space research both use shock tubes. This review focuses on shock tube testing for applications like ignition delay studies, shock and blast resistance of composite materials, phase modifications of Nano particles due to shock waves, medical investigations related to blast injuries, the behavior of joints, bolts under shock loads, and manufacturing processes using shock waves. Applications of shock tubes are described along with classifications, process parameters, rupture of the diaphragm, and shock wave formation.
