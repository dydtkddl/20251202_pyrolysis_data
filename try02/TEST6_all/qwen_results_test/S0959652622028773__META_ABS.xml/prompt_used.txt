You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction characteristics and lattice oxygen transformation mechanism of semi-coke chemical looping gasification with Fe2O3/CaSO4–Al2O3 oxygen carrier Chemical looping gasification (CLG) provides a potential way for clean utilization of solid fuels with the innate CO2 separation and capture. Selection of suitable oxygen carrier and operating conditions in reactor are the key for fuels conversion. In this work, Fe2O3–Al2O3, CaSO4–Al2O3 and Fe2O3/CaSO4–Al2O3 oxygen carriers (OCs) were synthesized by impregnation method and innovatively applied in semi-coke chemical looping gasification (SCCLG) for syngas production. The reaction conditions (oxygen carrier types, temperature, steam addition amount) of oxygen carrier for syngas production were tested in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a fixed-bed reactor. The experimental results showed that syngas yield of SCCLG with Fe2O3/CaSO4–Al2O3 is more than that with Fe2O3–Al2O3 or CaSO4–Al2O3 OC at 1000 °C when O/C ratio is 1:1. Furthermore, the maximum syngas yield (CO + H2) reached 129.20 mL/g of Fe2O3/CaSO4–Al2O3 at the gasification temperature of 950 °C. Results showed that the optimum operating conditions are steam rate of 0.06 mL/min at 950 °C with O/C of 1:1. Finally, the reaction mechanism of SCCLG was proposed based on experimental methods combing with advanced analytical testing and density functional theory (DFT) calculations results, and it reveals that OC in SCCLG underwent the reduction processes of Fe2O3/CaSO4–Al2O3 to CaFeSO/CaO–Al2O3 and then to Fe/CaS–Al2O3, which can efficiently improve the sulfur escape of CaSO4 OC. The present study provides an efficient way for conversion and utilization of fossil fuels in energy and chemical industry fields.
