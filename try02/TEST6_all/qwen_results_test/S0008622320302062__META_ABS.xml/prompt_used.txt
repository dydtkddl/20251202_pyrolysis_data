You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Neutron-irradiated antibody-functionalised carbon nanocapsules for targeted cancer radiotherapy Radiotherapy is a cancer treatment utilising high doses of ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells. Our team has pioneered neutron activation of 152Sm, filled and sealed into single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), to create stable and high-dose radioactive carbon nanocapsules for cancer radiotherapy. In this work, MWCNTs filled with enriched 152SmCl3 (Sm@MWCNTs) were sealed and irradiated, followed by surface functionalisation with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting antibody. Characterisation of functionalised Sm@MWCNTs was carried out using thermogravimetric analysis, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy. The organ biodistribution of the radioactive functionalised 153Sm@MWCNTs and therapeutic efficacy were studied in an experimental melanoma lung metastatic tumour model in mice after intravenous injection. Quantitative biodistribution analyses showed high accumulation of 153Sm@MWCNT-Ab in lung. Significant tumour growth reduction was induced by both treatments of 153Sm@MWCNTs functionalised with or without the antibody after a single intravenous injection. Although EGFR targeting showed no improvement in therapeutic efficacy, reduced spleen toxicity and normal haematological profiles were obtained for both functionalised derivatives. The current study demonstrated the possibility of performing chemical functionalisation and antibody conjugation on radioactive nanocapsules post-irradiation for the preparation of targeted radiopharmaceuticals.
