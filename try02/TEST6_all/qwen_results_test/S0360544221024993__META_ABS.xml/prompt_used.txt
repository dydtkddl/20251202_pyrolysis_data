You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Benzene conversion using a partial combustion approach in a packed bed reactor This study investigates the partial combustion technique for tar conversion using a modified experimental set up comprising a packed bed reactor with bed-inside probe for air supply. Simulated producer gas (SPG) and benzene were selected as a real producer gas alternative and model tar component respectively. The benzene conversion was investigated under different experimental conditions such as reactor temperature (650–900 °C), packed bed height (0–12 cm), residence time (1.2–1.9 s), air fuel ratio (0.2 and 0.3) and SPG composition. The results showed insignificant effect of temperature over benzene conversion while air fuel ratio of 0.3 caused high benzene conversion than at 0.2. Absence of packed bed lead high benzene conversion of 90% to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared to similar low PAHs free benzene conversion of 32% achieved at both packed heights. In SPG composition effect, H2 and CH4 had a substantial inverse effect on benzene conversion. An increase in H2 concentration from 12 to 24 vol% increased the benzene conversion from 26 to 45% while an increase in CH4 concentration from 7 to 14 vol% reduced the benzene conversion from 28 to 4%. However, other SPG components had insignificant impacts on benzene conversion.
