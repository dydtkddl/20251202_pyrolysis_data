How does DOPO flame retard polybutylene succinate? An in-depth mechanism investigation 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) is an efficient phosphorus-based flame retardant which may act in the gas phase to flame retard polyesters. When it was incorporated at 10wt% loading in polybutylene succinate (PBS), it was observed, in mass loss cone test (MLC) that the time to ignition (TTI) was dramatically increased from 119 s to 467 s and 2206 s under a heat flux of 35 kW/m2 and 25 kW/m2 respectively. Various techniques have been used to investigate its mode of action. Mass spectra (MS) results indicate that the sublimation and thermal decomposition products of DOPO are formed in the gas phase. A large quantity of combustible gases (mainly tetrahydrofuran and succinic anhydride) was observed before ignition by an in-situ infrared spectra combining with MLC (IR-MLC). Therefore, decomposition/sublimation products of DOPO have a strong flame poisoning effect that prevents the material's ignition until the combustible gases reach a critical concentration and ignite.
