RSM-optimised slow pyrolysis of rice husk for bio-oil production and its upgradation The present work highlights thermal decomposition of acid treated rice husk to produce useful and valuable products using slow pyrolysis process. The sample with higher volatile matter content (57.8%) and reduced metallic contaminants was pyrolyzed and the process was optimised using CCD followed by RSM to achieve maximum bio-oil yield. In order to determine the trend and relationship between the experimental responses and the process variables, mainly temperature (300–600 °C), nitrogen flowrate (0.87–1.5 LPM) and holding time (20–60 min), a quadratic model was developed based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Temperature showed maximum effect, followed by holding time and nitrogen flowrate. Optimum conditions for process were found to be 427 °C, 0.8 LPM and 45 min, which resulted in maximum bio-oil yield of 35.5 wt% with 50.8 wt% biomass conversion. Acid pre-treatment was carried out to remove inorganics, which otherwise would have led to formation of low molecular weight compounds in bio-oil. Optimised bio-oil was further subjected to solvent extraction to improve its quality in terms of low water content (25.8 wt%) and high calorific value (14.56 MJ/kg). The upgraded bio-oil was thoroughly characterised and found to be a complex mixture of acids, phenols, aromatics, esters and other substances.
