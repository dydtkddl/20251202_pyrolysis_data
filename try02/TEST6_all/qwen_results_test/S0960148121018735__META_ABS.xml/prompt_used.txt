You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling and simulation of a multi-bed industrial reactor for renewable diesel hydroprocessing The complexity of designing and optimizing vegetable oil hydrotreating reactors lies in describing multiple phenomena, including heat and mass transfer, hydrogen consumption, pressure drop, and a complicated network of highly exothermic reactions. This study intends to analyze the behavior of a vegetable oil hydroprocessing unit in a commercial environment via modeling and simulation techniques. In order to describe the three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) system in a detailed manner, a commercial-scale reactor model having multiple catalyst beds and inter-bed quench gas injections was constructed accounting for the heat and mass transfer between phases, the dynamic response of the system, the variation in gas phase velocity, and intraparticle effects. Based on dynamic reactor simulations, quench gas injection strategies were proposed to control the reactor temperature profile and yield of the desired products. Simulation results showed that the selection of a feed inlet temperature plays a major role in reactor overheating and quench injections must start as soon as the reactant stream reaches the inter-bed quench zone to stabilize reactor temperature more rapidly during start-up. In addition, the lengths of the catalyst beds need to be adjusted such that the heat released by chemical reactions is properly distributed along the reactor. The results overall provide useful information for the design and optimization of commercial-scale catalyst bed configurations for hydrotreating renewable feedstock. In particular, it is highlighted that by means of an appropriate gas quenching configuration, reactor temperature can be adequately controlled, allowing higher yields of green diesel.
