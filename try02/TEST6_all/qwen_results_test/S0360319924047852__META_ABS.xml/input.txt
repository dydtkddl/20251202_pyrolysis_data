Reshaping the energy landscape: Explorations and strategic perspectives on hydrogen energy preparation, efficient storage, safe transportation and wide applications As the global demand for clean energy continues to rise, hydrogen, as a promising clean energy carrier, is increasingly becoming the focus of international attention. This paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of hydrogen preparation strategies, recent advances in storage and transportation technologies, and the extensive application of hydrogen in many fields. First, we explored the current mainstream hydrogen preparation paths, including but not limited to hydroelectrolysis (decomposition of water molecules using renewable energy power); gas steam reforming (traditional but efficient hydrogen production methods requiring carbon emission management); biomass gasification and coal gasification (based on innovative utilisation of renewable and fossil resources); and hydrolysis hydrogen production (advanced cutting-edge technology directly using solar energy). Each method shows its unique advantages and potential application scenarios. Subsequently, we have focused on hydrogen storage technology, a key area that is undergoing rapid technological innovation and widespread application. Hydrogen storage technology, with its energy storage and release characteristics without carbon dioxide emissions, is regarded as an important bridge to promote the transformation of energy structure and achieve the sustainable development goals. This paper not only expounds the basic principle of hydrogen storage technology and historical evolution, also analyzed in detail in the compressed hydrogen, liquid hydrogen and solid hydrogen storage form of concrete application examples, at the same time, the selection of hydrogen storage materials, cost efficiency, safety performance and deeply analyzes the core challenges, and the future development trend and potential solutions. In terms of hydrogen transport, this paper will introduce three common transport modes: gas transport, liquid transport and hydrogen carrier transport. Further, we turned to the diversified utilisation technology of hydrogen, focusing on the breakthroughs of fuel cell technology in energy conversion efficiency, Hydrogen combustionand, thow hydrogen energy can help to achieve low-carbon travel in the transportation field. The integration and application of these technologies not only broaden the use of hydrogen energy, but also lay a solid foundation for them to occupy a core position in the clean energy system. To sum up, through a detailed review, this paper draws a panorama of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and use, revealing the key role and huge potential of hydrogen energy in the clean energy transition. We look forward to that this paper will provide valuable reference and inspiration for researchers, engineers and policy makers, jointly promote the continuous progress and wide application of hydrogen technology, and contribute to the construction of a green and low-carbon future.
