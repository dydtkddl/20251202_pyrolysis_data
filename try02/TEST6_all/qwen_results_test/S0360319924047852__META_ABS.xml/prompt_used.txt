You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reshaping the energy landscape: Explorations and strategic perspectives on hydrogen energy preparation, efficient storage, safe transportation and wide applications As the global demand for clean energy continues to rise, hydrogen, as a promising clean energy carrier, is increasingly becoming the focus of international attention. This paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of hydrogen preparation strategies, recent advances in storage and transportation technologies, and the extensive application of hydrogen in many fields. First, we explored the current mainstream hydrogen preparation paths, including but not limited to hydroelectrolysis (decomposition of water molecules using renewable energy power); gas steam reforming (traditional but efficient hydrogen production methods requiring carbon emission management); biomass gasification and coal gasification (based on innovative utilisation of renewable and fossil resources); and hydrolysis hydrogen production (advanced cutting-edge technology directly using solar energy). Each method shows its unique advantages and potential application scenarios. Subsequently, we have focused on hydrogen storage technology, a key area that is undergoing rapid technological innovation and widespread application. Hydrogen storage technology, with its energy storage and release characteristics without carbon dioxide emissions, is regarded as an important bridge to promote the transformation of energy structure and achieve the sustainable development goals. This paper not only expounds the basic principle of hydrogen storage technology and historical evolution, also analyzed in detail in the compressed hydrogen, liquid hydrogen and solid hydrogen storage form of concrete application examples, at the same time, the selection of hydrogen storage materials, cost efficiency, safety performance and deeply analyzes the core challenges, and the future development trend and potential solutions. In terms of hydrogen transport, this paper will introduce three common transport modes: gas transport, liquid transport and hydrogen carrier transport. Further, we turned to the diversified utilisation technology of hydrogen, focusing on the breakthroughs of fuel cell technology in energy conversion efficiency, Hydrogen combustionand, thow hydrogen energy can help to achieve low-carbon travel in the transportation field. The integration and application of these technologies not only broaden the use of hydrogen energy, but also lay a solid foundation for them to occupy a core position in the clean energy system. To sum up, through a detailed review, this paper draws a panorama of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and use, revealing the key role and huge potential of hydrogen energy in the clean energy transition. We look forward to that this paper will provide valuable reference and inspiration for researchers, engineers and policy makers, jointly promote the continuous progress and wide application of hydrogen technology, and contribute to the construction of a green and low-carbon future.
