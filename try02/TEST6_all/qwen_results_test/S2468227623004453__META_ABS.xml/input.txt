Valorization of Agricultural Polyolefin Plastic Waste in the Kingdom of Morocco through Thermal Pyrolysis: Influence of Thermal Parameters on Pyrolytic Oil Yields This article focuses on exploring the recycling of agricultural plastic waste mixtures through the route of thermal cracking. In an experimental setting within a pilot-scale batch reactor, the impact of temperatures and heating rates on the yields obtained in the pyrolysis process have been meticulously examined. The temperatures of the pyrolysis process were varied between 360°C and 480°C, while the heating rates underwent changes, including 10, 15, and 30°C/min. The response parameters were the liquid, solid, and gas fractions. This research indicates that moderate temperatures and slower heating rates, resulting in extended reaction times, promote the generation of liquid fuel from pyrolysis. We achieved an optimal liquid fuel yield of 79% at 380°C, employing a temperature ramp of 10°C/min. Characterization of pyrolysis fuel resulting from the pyrolysis process revealed an extensive variety of hydrocarbons, requiring prior fractionation for optimal use in internal combustion engines. This step led to the separation into three distinct fractions: a light fraction (analogous to gasoline), accounting for 22.62% of the total weight, a middle fraction (similar to diesel), weighing 53.67% of the weight, and a heavy fraction (comparable to heavy diesel), totaling 23.71% of the weight. The light fraction presents an octane rating in line with conventional gasoline values, while the middle fraction meets the required cetane criteria for diesel.
