A review on recent advancements in extraction, removal and recovery of phenols from phenolic wastewater: Challenges and future outlook Water pollution is the major problem seen in today's scenario and even pollutants at low concentration harms our environment. In industrial sector usage of phenol is seen even at low concentrations. The interaction of phenol in the environment provides adverse effects to living beings. This review focuses on the toxicity of phenol and its impact towards environment and human health. The treatment techniques such as distillation, extraction, wet air oxidation, membrane process, electrochemical oxidation, biological treatment and finally adsorption techniques were discussed. Among many treatment techniques so far utilized in the treatment of phenol, adsorption was considered as one of the best technique due to its advantages such as reusability, ease in operation, large availability etc., This review also highlights the adsorption technique for the cleaner removal of phenol from aqueous solution with novel as well as low-cost adsorbents in the removal of phenolic compounds. This review also discusses about the drawbacks and issues related with adsorption of phenolic compounds.
