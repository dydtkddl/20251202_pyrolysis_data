You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biofuel Production Using Thermochemical Conversion of Heavy Metal-Contaminated Biomass (HMCB) Harvested from Phytoextraction Process Over the past few decades, bioenergy production from heavy metal-contaminated biomasses (HMCBs) has been drawing increasing attention from scientists in diverse disciplines and countries owing to their potential roles in addressing both energy crisis and environmental challenges. In this review, bioenergy recovery from HMCBs, i.e. contaminated plants and energy crops, using thermochemical processes (pyrolysis, gasification, combustion, and liquefaction) has been scrutinized. Furthermore, the necessity of the implementation of practical strategies towards sustainable phytoextraction and metal-free biofuels production has been critically discussed. To meet this aim, the paper firstly delivers the fundamental concepts regarding the remediation of the brownfields using phytoremediation approach, and then, reviews recent literature on sustainable phytoextraction of heavy metals from polluted soils. Thereafter, to find out the possibility of the cost-efficient production of metal-free biofuels from HMCBs using thermochemical methods, the impacts of various influential factors, such as the type of feedstock and metals contents, the reactor type and operating conditions, and the role of probable pre-/post-treatment on the fate of heavy metals and the quality of products, have also been discussed. Finally, based on relevant empirical results and techno-economic assessment (TEA) studies, the present paper sheds light on pyrolysis as the most promising thermochemical technique for large-scale electricity and heat recovery from HMCBs.
