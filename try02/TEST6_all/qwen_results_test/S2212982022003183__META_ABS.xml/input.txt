Biomass chemical upcycling of waste rPET for the fabrication of formamide-free TPEE microcellular foams via scCO2 foaming Currently, the fabrication of microcellular structure in thermoplastic polymer foams is heeded people’s attention owing to their extensive application prospects. In this work, we combine recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPET) with renewable bio-based monomers (namely, MPO, SeA, and PTMG) for the synthesis of value-added, long-lasting thermoplastic poly(ether ester) elastomers (TPEEs) via a novel and flexible polycondensation strategy. Following this, a facile, eco-friendly, effective, and green scCO2-based foaming methodology was applied to fabricate a series of lightweight and robust microcellular TPEE foams. The addition of MPO and SeA not only improves melt viscoelasticity and scCO2 uptake but also decreases TPEEs melting temperatures and improves the foaming temperature windows. The uniform microcellular foam structure with the smallest cell size (26–34 µm) and the highest cell density (>1011 cm3/cells) was successfully prepared. The TPEE foams unveiled a high expansion rate (6.1–8.5) and strong dimensional stability, and the creep shape recovery percentage of the foams ranged from 94.2% to 98.6%, respectively. Thanks to scCO2 foaming, TPEE foams' has zero formamides, meet safety requirements, and are suitable for commercial applications. Furthermore, the fabricated TPEE foams show excellent recyclability. Therefore, it reveals a promising future for the production of eco-friendly polymer foams through a simple, cost-effective, and green microcellular foaming technology.
