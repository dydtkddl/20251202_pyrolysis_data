You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass chemical upcycling of waste rPET for the fabrication of formamide-free TPEE microcellular foams via scCO2 foaming Currently, the fabrication of microcellular structure in thermoplastic polymer foams is heeded people’s attention owing to their extensive application prospects. In this work, we combine recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPET) with renewable bio-based monomers (namely, MPO, SeA, and PTMG) for the synthesis of value-added, long-lasting thermoplastic poly(ether ester) elastomers (TPEEs) via a novel and flexible polycondensation strategy. Following this, a facile, eco-friendly, effective, and green scCO2-based foaming methodology was applied to fabricate a series of lightweight and robust microcellular TPEE foams. The addition of MPO and SeA not only improves melt viscoelasticity and scCO2 uptake but also decreases TPEEs melting temperatures and improves the foaming temperature windows. The uniform microcellular foam structure with the smallest cell size (26–34 µm) and the highest cell density (>1011 cm3/cells) was successfully prepared. The TPEE foams unveiled a high expansion rate (6.1–8.5) and strong dimensional stability, and the creep shape recovery percentage of the foams ranged from 94.2% to 98.6%, respectively. Thanks to scCO2 foaming, TPEE foams' has zero formamides, meet safety requirements, and are suitable for commercial applications. Furthermore, the fabricated TPEE foams show excellent recyclability. Therefore, it reveals a promising future for the production of eco-friendly polymer foams through a simple, cost-effective, and green microcellular foaming technology.
