You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cyclotriphosphazene based materials: Structure, functionalization and applications In recent decades, cyclotriphosphazene (CTP) and its derivatives have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional physical and chemical properties, such as remarkable thermal/radiation stability, chain flexibility, flame retardancy, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Substantial progress has been made in CTP chemistry, as well as the exploration of new topological structures, functionalities, and applications of CTP-based materials. Thus, it holds great significance to summarize these key advancements to drive the development and application of CTP derivatives. In this comprehensive review, we present a historical perspective on the structures and properties of CTP and its derivatives. We provide an overview of the main chemical reactions and reaction mechanisms involved in CTP chemistry. Furthermore, we assess the current status of various CTP derivatives, including multi-substituted compounds, copolymers, linear polymers, dendrimers/hyperbranched polyphosphazenes, and crosslinked polyphosphazene, elucidating their synthesis methodologies. Moreover, we emphasize the recent notable achievements in a range of applications encompassing fluorescence, nonlinear optics, biomedical materials, catalyst supports, adsorption and separation, flame retardancy, and battery materials. Finally, we address the future opportunities and challenges associated with CTP derivatives.
