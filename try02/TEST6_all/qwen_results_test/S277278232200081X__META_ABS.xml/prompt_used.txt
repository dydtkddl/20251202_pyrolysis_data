You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics and fuel properties of the oil obtained from the pyrolysis of polypropylene over cobalt oxide In this study pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was performed with and without cobalt oxide from 355 to 445 °C in inert conditions in an indigenously manufactured furnace. No oil was produced from non-catalytic reaction; however, the catalytic reaction resulted in production of oil in sufficient quantity. Optimum conditions for the maximum oil yield were explored and 100 min reaction time, 430 °C temperature and 5% of catalyst in continuous flow of nitrogen were observed as the most appropriate conditions for maximum oil production. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the obtained oil was performed for determining the composition of the oil. Moreover, fuel properties of the oil were examined and found comparable with commercial fuel. Furthermore, thermal degradation of polypropylene with and without cobalt oxide catalyst was performed in a thermobalance under nitrogen environment in the temperature ranging from 30 to 600 °C at temperature programmed rate of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min. Using Kissinger-Akahira-Sunnose (KAS) kinetic model, the average activation energy (Ea) of non-catalytic reaction was found to be 83.14 kJ/mol, while in the presence of cobalt oxide the average Ea was observed as 63.55 kJ/mol. It was observed from the comparison of both the results that use of cobalt oxide has not only reduced Ea but also resulted in the production of oil having resemblance with fuel grade oil. Hence, cobalt oxide was found to be an efficient catalyst for the conversion of polypropylene into valuable products and the study performed on model polypropylene can be extended to polypropylene waste on industrial scale.
