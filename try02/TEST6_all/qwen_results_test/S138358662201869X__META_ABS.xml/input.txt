Supercritical fluid technology - an eco-friendly approach for resource recovery from e-waste and plastic waste: A review Rapid technological development and modernization lead to increased production and consumption of electronic equipment as well as plastic commodities. This results in a large generation of electronic waste (e-waste) and plastic waste. The most severe problem associated with these wastes is their informal recycling and improper disposal, threatening the environment and human health. On the other hand, these wastes also provide an opportunity for the recovery of metals and the generation of valuable products. Supercritical fluid technology provides an attractive alternative for the sustainable management of e-waste and plastic waste, as well as resource recovery from these wastes. Therefore, the present review focuses on the applications and potential of supercritical fluid technology for resource recovery from these wastes. The review article presents a comprehensive discussion about the generation and composition of e-waste and plastic waste, the principle of supercritical fluid technology, and the application of various supercritical solvents such as CO2, water, and alcohol for resource recovery from e-waste and plastic waste. Finally, the economic aspect of supercritical fluid technology is also critically reviewed, and a comparative economic analysis with existing technologies is presented. Based on critical analysis, it is observed that supercritical fluid technology provides a viable route for the treatment of both e-waste and plastic waste. However, the pilot-scale studies are not reported, and there is a need to further explore the supercritical fluid technology to make a strong case for industrial application.
