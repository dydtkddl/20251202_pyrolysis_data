You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Supercritical fluid technology - an eco-friendly approach for resource recovery from e-waste and plastic waste: A review Rapid technological development and modernization lead to increased production and consumption of electronic equipment as well as plastic commodities. This results in a large generation of electronic waste (e-waste) and plastic waste. The most severe problem associated with these wastes is their informal recycling and improper disposal, threatening the environment and human health. On the other hand, these wastes also provide an opportunity for the recovery of metals and the generation of valuable products. Supercritical fluid technology provides an attractive alternative for the sustainable management of e-waste and plastic waste, as well as resource recovery from these wastes. Therefore, the present review focuses on the applications and potential of supercritical fluid technology for resource recovery from these wastes. The review article presents a comprehensive discussion about the generation and composition of e-waste and plastic waste, the principle of supercritical fluid technology, and the application of various supercritical solvents such as CO2, water, and alcohol for resource recovery from e-waste and plastic waste. Finally, the economic aspect of supercritical fluid technology is also critically reviewed, and a comparative economic analysis with existing technologies is presented. Based on critical analysis, it is observed that supercritical fluid technology provides a viable route for the treatment of both e-waste and plastic waste. However, the pilot-scale studies are not reported, and there is a need to further explore the supercritical fluid technology to make a strong case for industrial application.
