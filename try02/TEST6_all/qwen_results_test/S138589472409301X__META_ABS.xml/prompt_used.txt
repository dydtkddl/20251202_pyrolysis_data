You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D printed flexible composites based on carbon fiber-led interfacial modification strategy for enhanced microwave absorption With the rapid popularization of the new generation of wearable flexible electronic products, to enhance the comfort and curved surface fit of the device, while reducing the impact of electromagnetic waves (EMW) emitted from each electronic component on the normal operation of the device, the design of high-performance flexible wave-absorbing composite materials is the key to solve the problem. In this paper, a carbon-fiber-dominated interface modification strategy is proposed based on the in-situ growth of ZIF-CoNi on the surface of carbon fiber as a carrier, and the generation of carbon nanotube arrays on the surface of the carbon fiber (CF) through high-temperature pyrolysis and metal atom-assisted catalytic generation to build up rich heterogeneous interfaces, which induces the generation of interfacial polarization and enhances the attenuation of electromagnetic waves. Melt extrusion was used to make the modified carbon fibers oriented inside the thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix, and the charge density and volume loss of the oriented and random distribution of carbon fibers in TPU were analyzed based on Comsol simulations. The effective absorption bandwidth of the CF/CoNi@C/TPU thermoplastic composite obtained by the 3D printing technique is 4.81 GHz at 2.14 mm thickness. It realizes the combination of microscopic interface modification design and modern processing engineering of 3d printing, which provides a new idea for the research and development of flexible wave-absorbing composites, and helps to promote the development of the new generation of wearable flexible electronic packaging field in the direction of multi-functional and high-performance.
