Upcycling heavy impure crude terephthalic acid into porous carbons for adsorption of dye pollutants: The role of endogenous ferric groups Crude terephthalic acid (CTA), a byproduct in the textile industry, is generated from the acid-precipitation process during the treatment of alkali-peeling (AP) wastewater. Due to its heavy impurity, CTA is typically disposed of as solid waste through incineration and landfilling, leading to severe pollution and resource wastage. In this work, an upcycling method was explored to convert CTA into carbonaceous adsorbent through pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 400 to 800 °C. The carbonization mechanism of CTA to carbon was thoroughly investigated by using TGA-MS, FT-IR and XPS analyses. The resulting CTA carbons exhibited excellent adsorption performance for dye adsorption. For instance, the adsorption capacity for methylene blue (MB) reached 87.9 mg/g, surpassing the performance of several biochar adsorbents. Besides, it was found that the adsorption performance of CTA carbons was better than that of Fe-PTA carbons which have larger specific surface area and such result was attributed to the rich acidic functional groups on CTA carbon surface. Moreover, used CTA carbons could be recovered efficiently by self-activating low-concentration peroxydisulfate, achieving the regeneration rate of 82 %. Our work offers a promising eco-friendly approach for CTA upcycling in textile industry.
