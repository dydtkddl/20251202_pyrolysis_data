You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal cleaning of the paint coatings for recovering silicate municipal solid waste and the analysis of coating dissociation mechanism The output of waste silicate municipal solid waste represented by waste glass is huge. However, the paint coating which affects the quality of remanufactured silicate products is hazardous waste and difficult to separate from silicate resources. The aim of this study is developing new technology to clean paint coating for a more complete recycling of silicate resources and to demonstrate the effectiveness of it. Thermal cleaning technology is applied to realize the eco-friendly silicate resource recovery in this study. As a result, masses of two paint coatings have decreased by 99.42% and 68.45%. Carbon-silicon bonds formed by coupling agent is the main cause of cleaning residue. The main dissociation product of two samples is carbon dioxide, accounting for 48.83% and 84.76% respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that multi-carbon groups (•CC•, CHCH, CC–CCH etc.) are generated in the process of thermal cleaning. Sufficient oxygen can control the conversion of these free radicals to propane, ethylene, benzene and other larger molecular. The cleaning activation energy of sample which can be completely dissociated is 132.68–167.74 kJ⋅mol−1. The chromatic aberration between the ultra-white glass remanufactured after cleaning and the standard product is 0.9922. It is conservatively estimated that this new technology can save $207,000 in annual decolorizer costs for traditional waste glass recycling and remanufacturing plants. Thermal cleaning can effectively reduce the loss of silicate resources during the cycle in a more environmentally friendly way.
