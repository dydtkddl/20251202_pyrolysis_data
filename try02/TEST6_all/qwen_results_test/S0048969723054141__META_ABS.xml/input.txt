Sustainable ethylene production: Recovery from plastic waste via thermochemical processes The concept of monomer recovery from plastic waste has recently gained broad interest in industry as a powerful strategy to reduce the environmental impacts of chemical production and plastic waste pollution. Herein, we focus on the ethylene recovery from plastic waste via thermochemical pathways, such as pyrolysis, gasification, and steam cracking of pyrolysis oil derived from plastic waste. Ethylene recovery performance of different thermochemical conversion processes is evaluated and compared with respect to plastic waste types, process types, ethylene recovery yields, and process operating conditions. Based on the analysis of available data in earlier literature, future research is recommended to further enhance the viability of the thermochemical ethylene recovery technologies. This review is expected to offer a meaningful guideline on developing efficient platforms for the value-added monomer recovery from plastic waste through thermochemical conversion routes. It is also hoped that this review serves as a preliminary step to encourage the widespread adoption of thermochemical conversion-based ethylene recovery from plastic waste by industries.
