You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modified graphene oxide anode: A bioinspired waste material for bioremediation of Pb2+ with energy generation through microbial fuel cells Nowadays, Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) technology has received a great attention as a promising and sustainable technology to generate electricity and reduce environmental pollution. However, low energy generation and fabrication cost-issue of anode material hamper the commercial viability of MFCs. In this study, oil palm biomass waste-derived graphene derivatives (L-GO) was used as an anode in a double chamber of MFCs. Furthermore, to improve the electron transportation rate, composite based anode (L-GO/ZnO) was fabricated to generate energy and concurrently remediate the Pb2+ supplemented wastewater. The setup with L-GO/ZnO anode showed 91.07% removal efficiency of metal ions (Pb2+) while 85% removal efficiency was exhibited by L-GO anode. Moreover, the composite anode (L-GO/ZnO) delivered maximum power density (1350 × 10−3 mW/m2) and current density (142.98 mA/m2) which are higher than L-GO anode (power density = 20 × 10−3 mW/m2 and current density = 17.54 mA/m2). The anode performance was well supported by electrochemical and physicochemical analyses. The results of the fabricated anodes showed that oil palm biomass can be used as a promising and low-cost material to enhance the anode performance of MFCs.
