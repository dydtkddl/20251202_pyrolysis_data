You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Converting waste PET plastic into sulfonated carbon nanosheets supported PANI nanocomposite as anode catalyst in biophotovoltaic cells Value-added graphitic carbon nanosheets are derived from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles via pyrolysis followed by sulfuric acid treatment. The resultant sulfonated carbon (S-gN) is composited with polyaniline (PANI), which shows excellent electrochemical performance and is employed as an anode catalyst in biophotovoltaic (BPV) cells. Morphological studies reveal PANI nanotubes covered in graphitic carbon nanosheets, and diffusion rings observed in the SAED patterns disclose the amorphous structure of S-gN/PANI. The XRD patterns of S-gN/PANI show the characteristic diffraction peaks of graphitic carbon and PANI, confirming composite formation. Furthermore, the presence of PANI and sulfonated carbon nanostructures is well supported by FTIR, EDAX, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results. S-gN/PANI registered the maximum BPV power output of 11.8 mW m−2 in the presence of Chlorella vulgaris corroborated by porous, surface active, and heterogeneous S-gN, facilitating an effective interaction with PANI nanotubes via electrostatic/π–π stacking. With these constructive interactions, PANI grown on S-gN provides more conduction channels, electrically conductive sites, and enriched catalytic active sites that enable access to the growth medium and facilitate sustainable electron transfer from microalgae to the electrode surface. The increasing microalgae growth enables healthy biofilm formation on S-gN/PANI/carbon cloth and promotes electron transfer from microalgae to the electrode, yielding excellent BPV output.
