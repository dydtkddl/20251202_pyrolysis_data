Zirconia coatings by spray pyrolysis Zirconia coatings were obtained with the spray pyrolysis process, using a precursor solution of zirconium n-propoxide in 1-propanol. An investigation was undertaken into the influence of carrier gas (air, He, N2 and Ar), temperature (450 and 600 °C), time (1 and 2 h) and substrate composition (borosilicate glass, alumina, stainless steel and carbon steel) on coating characteristics. The most important deposition parameters were found to be the atomic or molecular weight of the carrier gas and the pyrolysis temperature. Cubic ZrO2 thin films, with dense and homogeneous nanostructrure were obtained using He and N2 as carrier gas, at 600 °C, on ceramic substrates.
