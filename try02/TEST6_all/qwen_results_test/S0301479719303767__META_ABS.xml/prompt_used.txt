You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of biomass and polyurethane waste co-pyrolysis on soot formation at high temperatures Soot is an important toxic pollutant generated during high-temperature incineration of solid waste (i.e., biomass and plastic waste) under air-lean conditions, and has a great impact on flame radiation. The main objective of this work is to study the synergistic effect of biomass and polyurethane co-pyrolysis on soot formation at high temperatures (1100–1250 °C). The effects of temperature, biomass species, and co-pyrolysis ratio on the yield, morphology, composition and reactivity of soot particles are studied. Results show that under controlled co-pyrolysis conditions, the measured soot yield from co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyurethane is lower than the theoretical value by weight average, while the particle size distribution tends to concentrate on a smaller diameter range. The degree of synergistic effect increases with the increasing biomass ratio (0–50 wt%) and decreasing pyrolysis temperature. Wood in co-pyrolysis presents a stronger synergistic effect on soot yields than straw co-pyrolysis does. Degree of synergistic effect on soot oxidation reactivity depends much on the biomass addition ratio but less on pyrolysis temperature. At 10 wt% straw addition ratio, co-pyrolysis exerts a negative synergistic effect on soot oxidation reactivity, while the synergistic effect turns significantly positive when the straw addition ratio increases to 50 wt%.
