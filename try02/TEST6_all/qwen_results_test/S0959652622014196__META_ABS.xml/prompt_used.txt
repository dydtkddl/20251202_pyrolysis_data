You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An efficient heterogeneous solid acid catalyst derived from sewage sludge for the catalytic transformation of sludge into biodiesel: Preparation, characterization, and arylation process modeling Homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production are facing challenges such as corrosion, leaching of active sites, and separation difficulties. Herein, a safe, chemically stable, and high-recoverable heterogeneous solid acid catalyst was fabricated and successfully evaluated in the catalytic transesterification of sludge-derived lipids. To this end, sludge-based granular activated carbon (SBGAC) was prepared and arylated with 4-sulfobenzenediazonium chloride in a reducing agent-free reaction. Hybrid models of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with evolutionary algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA-FIS), particle swarm optimization (PSO-FIS), and ant colony optimization (ACO-FIS) were developed to model and optimize the empirical relationship between arylation parameters. The highest PhSO3H density (1.36 mmol/g) was obtained at 70 °C, 7.6 min arylation time, and a mass ratio of acid to SBGAC of 9.83 using the PSO-FIS model, which was ∼26% more than the value obtained without optimization. Loading 20 wt% of this catalyst in the transesterification of sludge-originated lipid at 70 °C yielded 17.34% (w/w dry sludge) biodiesel after 14 h. Coating the catalyst granules on the polystyrene grains was significantly enhanced its recoverability from the reaction mixture. Moreover, the spent catalyst exhibited good chemical stability and reusability after the ninth transesterification cycle.
