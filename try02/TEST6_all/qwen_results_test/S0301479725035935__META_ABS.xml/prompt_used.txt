You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of oily sludge and algal biomass Alternative fuels have attracted rising attention as sustainable energy options due to mounting pressures to lower greenhouse gas emissions and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of oily sludge (OS), a petroleum refinery residue, and algal biomass (AB), a biological waste stream rich in organic content from refinery wastewater treatment units. The aim was to evaluate the potential of these residues to produce a solid biofuel with improved energy yield and char stability.The optimum blend composition of 75 % OS with 25 % AB (OS–AB) was used. Pre-drying of the feed with air at 105 °C for 24 h ensured the removal of moisture. Pyrolysis runs were performed at different temperatures of 350, 450, and 550 °C under constant nitrogen flow of 5 L/min with fixed residence time of 60 min. Optimum pyro-char yield was achieved at 450 °C.Test of residence time further at optimal 450 °C for 45, 60, and 75 min resulted in 75 min achieving best quality char. Holistic fuel characterization by higher heating value (HHV), proximate and ultimate analyses, energy recovery (ER), energy yield (EY), atomic ratios, and fuel ratio (FR) showed increased fixed carbon content and increased HHV, increased carbonization, and thermal stability of OS–AB chars. The resulting pyro-char HHV in this research was substantially increased by an approximate 63.92 %, i.e., from 4.85 MJ/kg (OS-AB control) to 7.95 MJ/kg under optimized co-pyrolysis (450 °C for 75 min). Interestingly, co-pyrolysis resulted in an increase in char quality compared to single feedstock systems. These results justify co-pyrolysis of OS and AB as an appropriate wastes valorization process for production of solid carbon fuel with added value of both environment cleanup and production of renewable energy in oil refineries petrochemical industries.
