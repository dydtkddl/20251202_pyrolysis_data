You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Examining impact of vapor-induced crosslinking duration on dynamic mechanical and static mechanical characteristics of silane-water crosslinked polyethylene compound Silane-crosslinked polyethylene (Si-XLPE) compounds are widely used cable insulation materials, cured by water as the crosslinking inducer. Herein, an attempt was made to evaluate the alterations of dynamic mechanical and static mechanical properties of Si-XLPE by increasing the water vapor-triggered crosslinking duration. The criterion for determining the progress of crosslinking was based on an industrially-used method (hot set test), and results indicated 16 h of vapor exposure as an appropriate duration for approaching maximum attainable crosslinking extent. Progress in crosslinking during this period was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. DMA was employed to assess the variations of dynamic mechanical behavior. Extending the crosslinking duration affected the storage modulus noticeably, and decreased it due to adverse effect of crosslinking on crystallinity. DSC confirmed the diminishment of crystallinity owing to the extended crosslinking time. Furthermore, prolonged vapor exposure period impacted β and γ transitions due to the influence of formed crosslinks on the mobility of chains. Tensile testing was carried out to ascertain the static mechanical characteristics of crosslinked samples. Findings demonstrated that tensile strength at yield increased below 5%, and tensile stress at break grew around 17%. Besides, elongation and Young's modulus experienced nonmonotonic changes due to the lengthened crosslinking period.
