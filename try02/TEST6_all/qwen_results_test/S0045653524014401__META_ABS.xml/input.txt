Microplastics in aquatic systems: An in-depth review of current and potential water treatment processes Plastic products, despite their undeniable utility in modern life, pose significant environmental challenges, particularly when it comes to recycling. A crucial concern is the pervasive introduction of microplastics (MPs) into aquatic ecosystems, with deleterious effects on marine organisms. This review presents a detailed examination of the methodologies developed for MPs removal in water treatment systems. Initially, investigating the most common types of MPs in wastewater, subsequently presenting methodologies for their precise identification and quantification in aquatic environments. Instruments such as scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and Raman tweezers stand out as powerful tools for studying MPs. The discussion then transitions to the exploration of both existing and emergent techniques for MPs removal in wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. This includes a description of the core mechanisms that drive these techniques, with an emphasis on the latest research developments in MPs degradation. Present MPs removal methodologies, ranging from physical separation to chemical and biological adsorption and degradation, offer varied advantages and constraints. Addressing the MPs contamination problem in its entirety remains a significant challenge. In conclusion, the review offers a succinct overview of each technique and forwards recommendations for future research, highlighting the pressing nature of this environmental dilemma.
