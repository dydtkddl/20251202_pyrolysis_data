You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics in aquatic systems: An in-depth review of current and potential water treatment processes Plastic products, despite their undeniable utility in modern life, pose significant environmental challenges, particularly when it comes to recycling. A crucial concern is the pervasive introduction of microplastics (MPs) into aquatic ecosystems, with deleterious effects on marine organisms. This review presents a detailed examination of the methodologies developed for MPs removal in water treatment systems. Initially, investigating the most common types of MPs in wastewater, subsequently presenting methodologies for their precise identification and quantification in aquatic environments. Instruments such as scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and Raman tweezers stand out as powerful tools for studying MPs. The discussion then transitions to the exploration of both existing and emergent techniques for MPs removal in wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. This includes a description of the core mechanisms that drive these techniques, with an emphasis on the latest research developments in MPs degradation. Present MPs removal methodologies, ranging from physical separation to chemical and biological adsorption and degradation, offer varied advantages and constraints. Addressing the MPs contamination problem in its entirety remains a significant challenge. In conclusion, the review offers a succinct overview of each technique and forwards recommendations for future research, highlighting the pressing nature of this environmental dilemma.
