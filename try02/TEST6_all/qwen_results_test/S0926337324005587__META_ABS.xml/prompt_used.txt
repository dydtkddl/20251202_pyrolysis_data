You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemical ammonia oxidation on terephthalic acid framework (BDC-NH2) derived core-shell nickel oxide/nickel-enriched 2D carbon nanoflakes (NiO/Ni/CNF) A terephthalic framework, Ni-BDC-NH2, was used to synthesize the nickel nanoparticles and nanoclusters on-site encapsulated within mesoporous carbon nanoflakes (NiO/Ni/CNF) for ammonia electrolysis. Ni2+ nodes recrystallized to form a core-shell oxide film covering the Ni metal, with the dispersity and particles size influenced by the pyrolysis temperature in a N2 atmosphere. Electrochemical characterization and Raman spectra identified the solid-state Ni(II) ⇌ Ni(III) transition as the electron mediator, while its lowered onset potential (+1.3 V vs. RHE), compared to that of oxygen evolution reaction (+1.7 V) enhanced the Faradaic efficiency. The performance of electrodes in ammonia oxidation was assessed, which revealed a N2 selectivity of at least 80 % under electrolytic conditions of current density = 0.5 – 1.5 mA cm−2, pH > 10, and initial NH3 level = 50–300 mg-N L−1 using NiO/Ni/CNF(700). An undivided cell equipped with NiO/Ni/CNF(700) anode and Cu/Ni cathode was utilized to treat a real wastewater (∼500 mg-N L−1, pH 4.5). Consequently, both the removal efficiency of NH3 and N2 selectivity surpassed 90 % in a continuous flow mode for 4 days, indicating the durability of electrode system.
