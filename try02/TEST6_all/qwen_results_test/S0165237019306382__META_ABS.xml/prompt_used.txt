You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fleur de Sel—An interregional monitor for microplastics mass load and composition in European coastal waters? Microplastics (MP) are an omnipresent marine contaminant. Mass related MP data facilitate interregional and/or temporal comparisons of MP loads in various environmental compartments. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) provided mass and type classification of MP for nine environmentally common polymers at trace levels. Applied to 17 commercial Atlantic and Mediterranean marine salt samples all targeted polymers were detected at least once. Polypropylene and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (both in 16 of the 17 samples), polyethylene (15/17), polystyrene (13/17) and poly(vinyl chloride) (7/17) were those most frequently found. Total MP content of Fleur de Sel (FdS) (138–1993 μg/kg) exceeded that of sea salt (14–60 μg/kg) considerably, due to different harvesting conditions. Disposable packaging and textile fibers are supposed to be the most prominent sources. Regional patterns of MP compositions are distinguished and enable mapping for further targeted source related studies. MP in FdS reflects the MP mass load of corresponding coastal waters and provides its temporal/spatial investigation.
