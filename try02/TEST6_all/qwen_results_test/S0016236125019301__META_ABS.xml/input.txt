Research on performance optimization of Alkali-Metal-Rich biomass chemical looping gasification using Ex-Situ process In the process of biomass chemical looping gasification(BCLG), the interactions between alkali metals and OC are complex and multifaceted. To clarify the mechanisms of these interactions, this study proposes an ex-situ process, where biomass and OC are separately configured. BCLG experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor, and the effects of different alkali metal concentrations and different reaction modes on the gasification process were analyzed. The results indicated that the carbon conversion rate in CLG increased from 66.5 % to 72.9 %, and the gasification efficiency improved from 81.8 % to 85.4 % after the addition of alkali metals. The introduction of alkali metals effectively catalyzes the cleavage of biomass macromolecules and the redox reactions of the oxygen carrier, thereby increasing the yield of products from BCLG. Under the ex-situ mode, the carbon conversion rate of rice husks loaded with 5 % KCl was the highest at 77.5 %, with H2 production and gasification efficiency reaching 614.7 ml/g and 96 %, respectively. After 10 cycles, the gasification efficiency decreased to 88.6 %, which was still higher than that of the initial reaction under the in-situ mode. Moreover, the oxygen carrier’s crystal phase and microstructure did not change significantly, demonstrating better reaction performance and cyclic stability.
