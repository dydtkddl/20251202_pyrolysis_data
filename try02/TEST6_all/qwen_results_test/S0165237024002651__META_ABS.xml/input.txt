Regulation of co-pyrolysis behavior of Naomaohu coal and polypropylene by controlling the cracking of polypropylene pyrolysis volatiles Pyrolysis is one of the technologies for clean and efficient conversion and utilization of coal, however, low yield and poor quality of tar restrict its utilization. Waste polypropylene (PP) could be efficiently used to improve tar yield of low-rank coal via co-pyrolysis. To strengthen the generation and transfer of hydrogen-rich radicals, modified HZMS-5 (HZ5) catalyst was used to regulate the composition of PP pyrolysis volatiles. Results show that close contact between HZ5 catalyst and coal favors the formation of light components, which reaches the maximum value of 72.45 wt%. In the presence of zeolite catalysts modified with 0.2 mol/L NaOH (0.2Na-HZ5), light oil in tar exhibits an obvious increase of 12.78 % compared with HZ5. A synergetic effect analysis clarifies that C2-C3 produced from PP pyrolysis under the action of the catalyst participate in the formation of tar. And the reactive intermediates from secondary cracking of PP volatiles over 0.2Na-HZ5 promote the cleavage of O-containing groups in coal, leading to the increase of phenols and alcohols in tar. The co-pyrolysis behavior of benzyl phenyl ether /bibenzyl and PP is shown that the transfer of oxygenated compounds into liquid is enhanced, confirming a positive synergetic effect. Meanwhile, the clear inhibition of C2-C3 components further indicates their contribution to tar formation.
