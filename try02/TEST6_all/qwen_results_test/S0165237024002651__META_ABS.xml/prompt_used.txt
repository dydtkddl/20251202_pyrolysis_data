You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regulation of co-pyrolysis behavior of Naomaohu coal and polypropylene by controlling the cracking of polypropylene pyrolysis volatiles Pyrolysis is one of the technologies for clean and efficient conversion and utilization of coal, however, low yield and poor quality of tar restrict its utilization. Waste polypropylene (PP) could be efficiently used to improve tar yield of low-rank coal via co-pyrolysis. To strengthen the generation and transfer of hydrogen-rich radicals, modified HZMS-5 (HZ5) catalyst was used to regulate the composition of PP pyrolysis volatiles. Results show that close contact between HZ5 catalyst and coal favors the formation of light components, which reaches the maximum value of 72.45 wt%. In the presence of zeolite catalysts modified with 0.2 mol/L NaOH (0.2Na-HZ5), light oil in tar exhibits an obvious increase of 12.78 % compared with HZ5. A synergetic effect analysis clarifies that C2-C3 produced from PP pyrolysis under the action of the catalyst participate in the formation of tar. And the reactive intermediates from secondary cracking of PP volatiles over 0.2Na-HZ5 promote the cleavage of O-containing groups in coal, leading to the increase of phenols and alcohols in tar. The co-pyrolysis behavior of benzyl phenyl ether /bibenzyl and PP is shown that the transfer of oxygenated compounds into liquid is enhanced, confirming a positive synergetic effect. Meanwhile, the clear inhibition of C2-C3 components further indicates their contribution to tar formation.
