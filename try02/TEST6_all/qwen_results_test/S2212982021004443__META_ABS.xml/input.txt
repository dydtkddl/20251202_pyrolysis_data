Employment of biogas as pyrolysis medium and chemical feedstock Organic waste biomass is transformed to biogas via anaerobic digestion. Biogas is typically used as a gaseous fuel to produce heat and power, incentivized by regulatory support schemes in different regions and countries. However, energy production via biogas combustion is limited to local sites, and a lower fuel quality of biogas than natural gas is another limitation on the direct use of biogas as a fuel. Alternative ways are to employ biogas as (1) pyrolysis medium to effectively modify the quality and quantity of pyrolytic products and (2) feedstock for the production of high-value commodity chemicals. In this regard, this review is aimed at providing an overview on the use of biogas either as pyrolysis medium or as renewable chemical feedstock.
