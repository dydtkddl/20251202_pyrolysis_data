You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel method for gas-solid contact visualization and efficiency quantification in dry fixed-bed desulfurization A novel method for the visualization of gas–solid contact states and the quantitative evaluation of contact efficiency in the dry fixed-bed desulfurization process is proposed in this study. This method utilizes the chromogenic properties of phenolphthalein (PP) on the surfaces of various sodium salt products during the sodium bicarbonate dry desulfurization process, enabling visualization of gas–solid contact status. Samples of desulfurization products are photographed, and ImageJ software is employed for image processing to calculate color residual rates, thereby quantifying gas–solid contact efficiency. The specific operating conditions that produced the best visualization effect of gas–solid contact states were determined through experimentation, including: an appropriate PP solid content of ≤ 0.336 % for ultrafine NaHCO3 with D90 = 6.14 μm; a steam volume ratio of approximately 13.94 % to 24.46 %, a temperature inside the reactor of 110 °C–175 °C. Moreover, the fading effect of the indicative sodium-based absorbent was consistent across SO2 concentrations from 850 mg/m3 to 5100 mg/m3, with higher concentrations reducing the time needed for visualizing gas–solid contact and quantifying efficiency. The gas–solid contact efficiency (Egs = 87.85 %) calculated by the method showed a small deviation of only 0.55 % from the efficiency (E’gs = 88.4 %) calculated based on sulfur capacity, validating the method’s reliability. The study’s outcomes present a novel method for analyzing the gas–solid contact state, which can serve future efforts in the design optimization of dry fixed-bed desulfurization reactors.
