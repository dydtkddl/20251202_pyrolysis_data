You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on thermal decomposition and kinetics study of recovered oil from electronic waste by thermogravimetric analysis This paper investigated thermal decomposition during pyrolysis of a recovered oil from electronic waste (e-waste). The sample used in this study was High-Impact Polystyrene (HIPS). The pyrolysis target temperature was 400–550 °C. It was found that the maximum oil yield (32.5 wt.%) was obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. After the pyrolysis test, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the HIPS-derived oil to study on decomposition and kinetics. The produced pyrolysis oil that contained highest Styrene component (19.52%) was processed at 450 °C. From GC-MS and TGA, the first range (40-120 °C) could be devoted to moisture and other low volatility compounds such as Stylene, Benzene and 2-Hydroxymethyl. Then, the 1,2-Diphenylcyclopropane and α-Methylstyrene might be extensively decomposed at the second range (120-340 °C). The final peak (450-560 °C) could be the decomposition of Tetraphenylhexane. Activation energy of the pyrolysis oil was around 40-43 kJ/mol and 10-18 kJ/mol for the first and the second decomposition range, respectively, and the pyrolysis temperature did not significantly affect the activation energy of the produced oil.
