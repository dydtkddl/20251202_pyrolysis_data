You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the roles of endogenous minerals in the activation of persulfate by graphitized biochar for tetracycline removal Owing to its environmental-friendliness, low-cost, and outstanding characteristics, biochar has been widely used for the catalytic degradation of various organic pollutants. In this study, a pre- and post-deashing graphitized biochar (DBC800 and PBC800-A) was prepared and compared with the pristine biochar (PBC800) to activate persulfate (PS) for tetracycline (TC) degradation. The influence of the natural endogenous mineral on the catalytic ability of biochar was investigated. Characterization results show that the inherent endogenous mineral in biochar not only acted as a natural pore-forming agent to promote the formation of the porous structure, but also facilitated the formation of edge defective structures, and altered the surface functional groups, as well as increased the carbonization and graphitization degree of biochar. The PBC800-A exhibited a much higher catalytic efficiency on PS activation and TC oxidative degradation with the reaction rate of 0.06055 min−1, 7.14 times as that of DBC800 (0.00861 min−1) and 4.63 times as that of PBC800 (0.00158 min−1). The endogenous minerals were conducive to the generation of free radicals and promoted the oxidative degradation of TC, which was mainly attributed to the improved carbon configuration. The post-deashing treatment was also found to significantly improve the electron transport efficiency of biochar by removing the residual ash, thereby promoting the generation of singlet oxygen. This study demonstrated that the natural minerals in biochar was beneficial for the degradation of TC, and more alternative natural minerals can be applied to co-pyrolysis with biochar for the remediation of refractory organic pollutants.
