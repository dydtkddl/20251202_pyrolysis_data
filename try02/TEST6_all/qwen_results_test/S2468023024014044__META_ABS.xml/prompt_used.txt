You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MnO2-decorated flexible carbon nanofibers with controllable hierarchical porous nanostructures for high energy density supercapacitors Constructing hierarchical porous structures and reducing material size enhance the electrochemical efficiency of porous carbon-based electrodes. In this study, ultrafine hierarchical porous carbon-based nanofibers were synthesized via electrospinning a blend of polyacrylonitrile, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and zinc acetate dihydrate (ZAH), followed by pre-oxidation, carbonization, and acid washing. Adjusting the ZAH content allowed precise control of fiber diameters (300–600 nm) and promoted significant hierarchical porous structures, achieving an optimal mesopore to micropore ratio (1.65) and a high specific surface area (SSA) of 599 m²/g. MnO2 nanosheets were in-situ modified on the carbon nanofibers, forming a hybrid electrode (MnO2@HPCNFs) with excellent flexibility, high SSA value, and rich pore structure. This electrode demonstrated a specific capacitance value equal to 1035 F/g at 0.5 A/g and maintained 80.7% capacitance at 10 A/g. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 54.81 Wh/kg. This study presents new possibilities for binder-free, self-supporting electrodes in electrochemical energy storage devices.
