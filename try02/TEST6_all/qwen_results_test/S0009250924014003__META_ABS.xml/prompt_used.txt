You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Aromatization-free strategy for sustainable aviation fuel: Co-upcycling waste oils and polystyrene plastics into alkanes and aromatics Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising solution for reducing aviation-related carbon emissions. However, conventional SAF production methods such as waste oil aromatization face challenges like complex processing requirements and the generation of unwanted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study presents a novel, aromatization-free approach to SAF production by co-upcycling waste oils and polystyrene (PS) plastics. The inherent aromatic ring structures in PS plastics are utilized to directly form aromatic hydrocarbons, bypassing the need for traditional aromatization. A two-stage pressurized fixed-bed reactor was employed, where waste oils and PS underwent co-hydropyrolysis to generate intermediates, followed by gas-phase catalytic hydrogenation. Under optimized conditions (0.15 MPa H2, 480 °C for co-hydropyrolysis, 350 °C for hydrogenation, and 5 mg Pd/SBA-15 catalyst), this process yielded 71.0 wt% C8-C16 jet fuel components, with 84.5 % selectivity. In comparison, catalysts with higher acidity, such as Pd/HZSM-5 and Pd/USY, promoted side reactions like cracking, leading to lower liquid yields (35.7 wt% and 18.1 wt%, respectively) and a more complex product mixture. Additionally, Pd/SBA-15 catalyst demonstrated excellent stability, maintaining consistent catalytic performance over 10 repeated cycles, and showed potential for scalability with a variety of waste plastics and oils. The study underscores the feasibility of co-upcycling waste oils and PS plastics, offering an efficient, sustainable pathway to streamline SAF production while reducing the environmental impacts associated with conventional methods.
