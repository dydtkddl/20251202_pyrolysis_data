You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of coffee-grounds and waste polystyrene foam by calcium oxide in bubbling fluidized bed reactor The high concentration of oxygenated components in biomass pyrolysis oil challenges the conversion of biomass to bio-fuels via fast pyrolysis. Herein, calcium oxide was prepared to convert the oxygenated compounds in the pyrolytic products of coffee-grounds to valuable hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, waste polystyrene foam was co-pyrolyzed with coffee-grounds to promote hydrogen transfer reactions, resulting from scission of the polystyrene radicals. The results show that calcium oxide could effectively reduce the concentration of undesired oxygenated compounds like phenols and fatty acids in pyrolytic products. The effects of calcium oxide and polystyrene were mainly reflected in the production of a deoxygenated organic fraction, rich in aromatics and with a considerable calorific value. An organic fraction with an oxygen content of 13.38 wt% was obtained at a catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 1:8 and an amount of polystyrene foam of 20 wt%. This fraction, due to its properties and its compositions, is considered for use as potential feedstock in the energy market. Image 1 .
