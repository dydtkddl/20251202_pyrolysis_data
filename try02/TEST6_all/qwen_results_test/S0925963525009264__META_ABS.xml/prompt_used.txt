You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High surface area activated carbon with mesoporous structure from pyrolyzed Psidium guajava L. peel: Characterization and experimental design optimization for methyl violet 2B dye removal Herein, guava (Psidium guajava L.) peel (GP) was employed as a feedstock to produce a mesoporous and high surface area activated carbon (GP-AC) material by thermochemical pyrolysis process assisted ZnCl2 activation. Several characterization methods such as XRD, specific surface area (BET), TGA FSEM-EDX, FTIR, and pHpzc were employed to investigate the physicochemical properties of GP-AC. The BET result shows a high surface area of GP-AC (1267 m2/g) with a mesoporous structure and pore diameter (3.41 nm). The applicability of GP-AC as a sustainable adsorbent for methyl violet 2B (MV 2B) dye was evaluated and statistically optimized via Box Behnken design (BBD) and desirability function approach. The desirability ramp reveals the best MV 2B removal (97.2 %) was achieved after 17 min of the adsorption time, pH of 9.3 and GP-AC dose of 0.09 g/0.1L. According to the adsorption isotherm and kinetic investigations, the adsorption of MV 2B onto GP-AC surface was well explained by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, and pseudo second order (PSO) respectively. The adsorption capacity of GP-AC adsorption for MV 2B dye was found to be 169.9 mg/g at 25 °C. The thermodynamic functions indicate a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process for MV 2B dye by GP-AC. Various electrostatic forces, π-π attraction, and hydrogen bonding can be considered the most probable options for loading MV 2B dye onto GP-AC surface. Overall GP-AC shows preferable surface area and outstanding performance in eliminating MV 2B dye from the contaminated water.
