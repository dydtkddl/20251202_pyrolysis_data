You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Which thermochemical water-splitting cycle is more suitable for high-temperature concentrated solar energy? The manuscript reviews the thermochemical water-splitting cycles not in general (many other works have covered this topic) but specifically for producing hydrogen coupled with high temperature concentrated solar energy which is available at temperatures of 1000 to 1100 °C. This is important to benefit from synergies with near future dispatchable concentrated solar power, simply replacing the power cycle with the thermochemical hydrogen production plant. The review shows as three-step cycles are those benefiting the most from the synergy with higher solar flux dispatchable concentrated solar power with thermal energy storage, also profiting in terms of technology readiness level from past experiences in thermochemical water-splitting cycles for nuclear power plants, and the affordable complexity of the cycle. From preliminary evaluations, three-step cycles may permit CO2-free hydrogen production within a decade at a competitive cost with green hydrogen as well as the current prevailing production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons at less than $1 per 1 kg. The thermochemical pathway has the same minimum energy requirement as electrolysis, despite the conversion efficiencies achieved so far have been much less because of the reduced development. Since the collection of solar thermal energy is much easier and more efficient than solar photovoltaic conversion, the thermochemical pathway has the potential to deliver a cost of hydrogen smaller than green hydrogen from solar photovoltaic electricity and electrolyzers.
