Which thermochemical water-splitting cycle is more suitable for high-temperature concentrated solar energy? The manuscript reviews the thermochemical water-splitting cycles not in general (many other works have covered this topic) but specifically for producing hydrogen coupled with high temperature concentrated solar energy which is available at temperatures of 1000 to 1100 °C. This is important to benefit from synergies with near future dispatchable concentrated solar power, simply replacing the power cycle with the thermochemical hydrogen production plant. The review shows as three-step cycles are those benefiting the most from the synergy with higher solar flux dispatchable concentrated solar power with thermal energy storage, also profiting in terms of technology readiness level from past experiences in thermochemical water-splitting cycles for nuclear power plants, and the affordable complexity of the cycle. From preliminary evaluations, three-step cycles may permit CO2-free hydrogen production within a decade at a competitive cost with green hydrogen as well as the current prevailing production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons at less than $1 per 1 kg. The thermochemical pathway has the same minimum energy requirement as electrolysis, despite the conversion efficiencies achieved so far have been much less because of the reduced development. Since the collection of solar thermal energy is much easier and more efficient than solar photovoltaic conversion, the thermochemical pathway has the potential to deliver a cost of hydrogen smaller than green hydrogen from solar photovoltaic electricity and electrolyzers.
