Optimizing integration strategies for biomass gasification with natural gas pyrolysis under a low-carbon hydrogen enhancement approach: A financial and environmental perspective Integrating low-carbon hydrogen through “hydrogen enhancement” can notably increase carbon conversion efficiency in alcohol-based product synthesis, with potential improvements up to nearly double the typical rate. Producing low-carbon hydrogen via a natural gas pyrolysis system (NG-PS) offers a more economically viable approach compared to water electrolysis. This study evaluates and optimized strategies for incorporating natural gas pyrolysis into biomass-to-fuel conversion processes, focusing on the use of Rice Husk biomass as a case study for alcohol-based fuel production. The examined method includes Synthesis gas combustion, NG combustion, H2 combustion, internal heat integration, and electrical heating to supply the necessary heat for pyrolysis. The analysis provides both technoeconomic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission assessments. Results show that hydrogen-enhanced biomass use in fuel production can reduce GHG emissions by 81% based on a 100-year global warming potential (GWP), and by 72% based on a 20-year GWP, compared to conventional natural gas-based production methods.
