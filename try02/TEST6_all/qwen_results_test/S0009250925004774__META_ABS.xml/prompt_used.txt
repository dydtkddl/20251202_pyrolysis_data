You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing integration strategies for biomass gasification with natural gas pyrolysis under a low-carbon hydrogen enhancement approach: A financial and environmental perspective Integrating low-carbon hydrogen through “hydrogen enhancement” can notably increase carbon conversion efficiency in alcohol-based product synthesis, with potential improvements up to nearly double the typical rate. Producing low-carbon hydrogen via a natural gas pyrolysis system (NG-PS) offers a more economically viable approach compared to water electrolysis. This study evaluates and optimized strategies for incorporating natural gas pyrolysis into biomass-to-fuel conversion processes, focusing on the use of Rice Husk biomass as a case study for alcohol-based fuel production. The examined method includes Synthesis gas combustion, NG combustion, H2 combustion, internal heat integration, and electrical heating to supply the necessary heat for pyrolysis. The analysis provides both technoeconomic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission assessments. Results show that hydrogen-enhanced biomass use in fuel production can reduce GHG emissions by 81% based on a 100-year global warming potential (GWP), and by 72% based on a 20-year GWP, compared to conventional natural gas-based production methods.
