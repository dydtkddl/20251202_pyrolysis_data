Hydrogen from catalytic non-thermal plasma-assisted steam methane reforming reaction Steam methane reforming reaction was carried out in a dielectric barrier plasma reactor. A systematic study is conducted to understand the influence of input power, flow rate, and water for the conversion, yield, and selectivity of the reaction over strategically designed catalysts. In particular, the production rate and selectivity of the products (H2, CO and C2 hydrocarbons) are monitored. CeO2 was used as packing material, mixed with oxides of manganese or copper and their combination. The optimum Cu/CeO2 catalyst illustrated the production rate of 248.7 μmolg−1h−1 and 11.25 μmolg−1h−1 for H2, and CO, respectively at specific energy input of 19.8 JL-1. DFT calculations exhibit apparent change in electronic structure of the CeO2 after inclusion of oxides of manganese and copper that enhance interaction with methane. Based on these findings, a plausible mechanism is elucidated which can help to design catalyst for other applications in non-thermal plasma atmosphere.
