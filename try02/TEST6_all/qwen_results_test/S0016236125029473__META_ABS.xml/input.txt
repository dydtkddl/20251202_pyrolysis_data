Electrospun carbon nanofibers for hydrogen evolution reaction: Design, optimization, and mechanisms of electrocatalysts Electrospinning combined with post-processing techniques to produce carbon fibers with controlled morphological nanostructures, has proven to be a simple yet versatile method. Carbon nanofibers, with low cost, high stability, and high specific surface area, are considered highly promising as electrocatalysts or catalyst substrates for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Based on the introduction of electrospinning technology, carbon nanofiber preparation methods, and the basic principles of HER, the review highlights the properties of carbon nanofibers, modification methods, catalytic mechanisms, and the correlation between the optimization of catalytic performance and the structural composition of carbon nanofibers. Several composites based on electrospun carbon nanofibers are also listed, including MOFs, single atoms/clusters, alloy and high-entropy alloys, phosphide, sulfide, carbide, and nitride catalysts. Finally, this review discusses the benefits of electrospun carbon nanofiber-based HER electrocatalysts and examines the challenges and prospects for their future advancement.
