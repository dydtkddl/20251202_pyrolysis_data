You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface potential charge modulation and sequential etching strategies for optimizing SAPO-34 catalysts in the MTO process: Mechanistic insights into catalytic performance The methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process over SAPO-34 catalysts is significantly influenced by surface potential charge, affecting methanol adsorption, intermediate spillover, and coke formation. This study investigates the catalytic performance and mechanistic behavior of SAPO-34 catalysts modified through acidic (SP34-A), basic (SP34-B), and sequential acid-base (SP34-AB) etching, with the unmodified SAPO-34 (SP34-P) serving as a reference. The impact of surface potential charge on catalyst performance was examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, NH3-TPD acidity measurements, and zeta potential analysis. The results reveal that a highly negative surface charge (SP34-A, −67 mV) intensifies methanol adsorption but limits spillover efficiency, promoting formaldehyde accumulation and increasing coke deposition, ultimately reducing catalyst lifetime. In contrast, a positive surface charge (SP34-B, +22 mV) enhances spillover and moderates adsorption strength, reducing coke formation and extending catalyst stability. The sequential acid-base etched catalyst (SP34-AB, +16.9 mV) achieves a well-balanced surface charge, optimizing methanol adsorption, spillover behavior, and diffusion efficiency. This balance minimizes secondary reactions, extends catalyst lifetime (586 min, 1.63 times longer than SP34-P), and improves light olefin selectivity (88.82 %), demonstrating the superior catalytic performance of SP34-AB. Structural and textural analysis further confirms that hierarchical porosity, induced via sequential etching, enhances mass transfer and mitigates diffusion limitations, preventing excessive coke formation. These findings establish surface potential charge as a critical parameter in SAPO-34 catalyst design, highlighting sequential acid-base etching as an effective modification strategy to enhance MTO efficiency and catalyst longevity.
