You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled with nanocatalyst and pyrolysis oil produced from the solid plastic waste using screw reactor In recent years, the concerns of non-biodegradable mixed plastic waste have been growing and resulting in strengthening of technologies devoted to convert waste into energy. This study examined the technique to extract plastic oil from mixed plastic, non-biodegradable waste. Further, the mechanical characteristics of plastic pyrolysis oil were done. Pyrolysis method was used to extract the oil from plastic waste with screw reactor and the chemical compounds and the characterization of this oil was analyzed. The Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 was dispersed to enhance the quality of Waste pyrolysis oil (PO) by ultrasonication. The performance and emission characteristics of various fuels at different load conditions were analyzed by conducting a series of tests in single cylinder 4 stroke water cooled diesel engine. The benefit of the addition of 25 ppm of Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 in PO was represented graphically. A series of tests was conducted for various brake mean effective pressure of 1.3 bar, 2.6 bar, 3.9 bar and 5.2 bar for the test blends, PO (neat pyrolysis oil) and P25A (25% PO+ 75% diesel with 25 ppm of Al2O3). From the procured results, the addition of the novel nanoparticles increases the production of brake power by 35% with reduced emission of 45% and 60% of HC and CO2 respectively. On the other hand, the NOx emission was reduced by 15% and 9 % than the neat plastic oil and diesel fuel. Further, the usage of the pyrolysis oil at 25% generated the positive effects on both combustion and emission compared to neat PO.
