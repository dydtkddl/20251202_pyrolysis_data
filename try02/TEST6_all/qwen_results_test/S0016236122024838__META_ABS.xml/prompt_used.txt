You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of perovskites performance for coal tar decomposition by pore structure and acid-base modification Catalytic cracking is an efficient way to replace conventional combustion to remove coal tar deposited at the gas outlet of COREX melter gasifier. This work prepared a series of LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 perovskites (Ni 0.8) with different pore structures via the hard-template method and applied in the catalytic cracking of coal tar was operated at 700 °C to evaluate the performance of perovskites. Ni 0.8 prepared via MCM-48 template (MCM-0.8) exhibited the high specific surface area (SSA) of 90.2 m2/g and pore volume of 0.3 cm3/g, accounting for its highest gas yield (51.8 mmol/gcoal) and complete tar removal. The remarkable oxidation capacity of MCM-0.8 resulted in its highest CO2 yield (11.2 mmol/gcoal) and selectivity for oxygenated compounds in tar (71.1 %). Three mesoporous Ni 0.8 participated in the catalytic reactions as the acid-base bifunctional catalysts. Ni 0.8 prepared via SBA-15 template (SBA-0.8) showed a great hydrocracking activity due to its strongest acidity of 1.87 mmol/g. All the synthesized perovskites possessed a good reactant selectivity, and the tarry product selectivity over different perovskites was influenced by the synergistic effect of acidity and the reactant diffusion inside the catalyst channels.
