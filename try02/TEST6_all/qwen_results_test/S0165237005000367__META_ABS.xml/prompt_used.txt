You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MS study of the gases evolved in the pyrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers comparison between thermal and catalytic processes In this work, a fixed bed reactor connected to a mass spectrometer (MS) has been used to carry out a qualitative study of the evolution of the gases evolved in the pyrolysis of two commercial ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers (with 13 and 27.5% of vinyl acetate, respectively). The catalyst used was MCM-41 prepared by a two-step sol–gel method, in acid medium, at room temperature. Pure copolymer samples and mixtures of copolymer with around 10% of MCM-41 catalyst were pyrolysed in an He atmosphere at a heating rate of 10K/min. Once the less volatile compounds condensed, the gas evolved was analysed by MS. The study of the total ion current (TIC) curves as well as the evolution with time of the ions selected as representative of several compounds or groups of compounds confirm the existence of the two reaction steps suggested in the bibliography for the second stage of EVA pyrolysis: cracking of the polyethylene domains and cracking of the polyene domains, both domain types resulting from the first decomposition stage. On the other hand, the analysis and comparison of the evolution of the intensity of current corresponding to the selected mass ions in the thermal and catalytic processes show that the gas evolved always contains a higher amount of olefines than alkanes and that more conversion to gaseous products is obtained in the presence of the catalyst.
