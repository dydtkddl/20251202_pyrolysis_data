Low-rank coal pyrolysis polygeneration technology with semi-coke heat carrier based on the dual-fluidized bed to co-produce electricity, oil and chemical products: Process simulation and techno-economic evaluation Pyrolysis polygeneration technology is a good way to realize clean and efficient utilization of low-rank coal and heat carrier is a key factor. Aspen Plus is used to establish low-rank coal pyrolysis staged conversion polygeneration technology with semi-coke heat carrier based on dual-fluidized bed (CPSCPC-DFB), which couples with ultra-supercritical semi-coke powder furnace for power generation. Three processes are simulated to co-produce methanol (CPSCPC-DFB-M), synthetic natural gas (CPSCPC-DFB-S) and hydrogen (CPSCPC-DFB-H). Mass and carbon balance are established, techno-economic, environmental and sensitivity analysis are carried out, and the comparison with ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plant (SCFP) is made. The results show that the comprehensive performances of CPSCPC-DFB-M, CPSCPC-DFB-S and CPSCPC-DFB-H are significantly better than those of SCFP in energy loss (49.37%, 47.33%, 45% and 55.6%), CO2 emissions (2.07, 2.12, 2.22 and 2.52 kg/kgcoal), internal rate of return (23.24%, 21.83%, 29.52% and 17.56%). Although the total investment of CPSCPC-DFB is much higher than SCFP, the net present value is better than SCFP. Comparing the three polygeneration systems, the total investment and CO2 emissions of CPSCPC-DFB-H are slightly higher than those of other two systems, but CPSCPC-DFB-H has absolute advantages in economy. Sensitivity analysis shows that the anti-risk ability of the polygeneration systems are significantly improved.
