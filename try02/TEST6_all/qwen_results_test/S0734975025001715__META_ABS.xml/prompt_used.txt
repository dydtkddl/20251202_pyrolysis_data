You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-upcycling PET waste: Advances in enzymatic hydrolysis and biosynthesis of value-added products With excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability, poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), an engineering plastic, is widely applied in textiles and packaging. However, the widespread use and low biodegradability of PET have resulted in significant environmental pollution. Recent advances in PET hydrolase discovery and engineering have driven the rapid advancement of PET bio-recycling, while efficient PET hydrolases can depolymerize PET into monomers under mild conditions, providing a sustainable approach to potentially addressing the plastic pollution issue. However, PET enzymatic hydrolysis still faces some technical challenges, such as poor stability of the hydrolases and low efficiency in degrading high-crystalline PET. Thus, this review summarizes recent advances in strategies to enhance the efficiency of PET enzymatic hydrolysis and explores the interplay of factors affecting PET hydrolysis efficiency. Furthermore, we highlight the progress in metabolic engineering approaches for the biotransformation of PET degradation products into higher value chemicals, providing insights into achieving efficient PET bio-recycling. This review systematically integrates key factors for enhancing the PET enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and showcases successful examples of PET waste further valorization, providing valuable references and insights for the industrialization of PET bio-upcycling.
