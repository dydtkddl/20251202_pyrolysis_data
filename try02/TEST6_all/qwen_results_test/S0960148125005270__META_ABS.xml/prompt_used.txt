You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of biomethane production from purified biowaste pyrolysis gas: A comparative techno-economic assessment This study investigates a novel pathway for biomethane production by converting biogenic residues into product gas through pyrolysis, water-gas shift reaction, and microbial methanogenesis. A key challenge in this process is gas purification, as the product gas must meet certain requirements for grid feed-in while ensuring economic feasibility. Unlike conventional biomethane production via anaerobic digestion in biogas plants, this approach enables the utilization of recalcitrant biogenic residues while minimizing process-immanent limitations. The research integrates gas purification with a techno-economic assessment, focusing on achieving a higher H2/CO2 ratio through CO2 removal, thereby minimizing additional hydrogen demand. A unique case study demonstrates that expanding the process with a scrubbing unit reduces hydrogen procurement costs by approximately 51 %, achieving the lowest levelized cost of biomethane at 143 €/MWh. Sensitivity analysis reveals that hydrogen price is the most critical factor for economic feasibility, while electricity price has minor impact. The findings provide actionable insights for scaling biomethane production from biogenic residues via pyrolysis, offering a promising alternative to conventional biogas upgrading. The study highlights the crucial role of tailored gas purification strategies and recommends scrubbing units as a key component for future industrial applications.
