You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Use of 2H-labeled nanoplastics to study their accumulation and toxicity in Daphnia magna Understanding the interactions between nanoplastics (NP) and biota is essential for risk assessment. However, NP quantification in complex matrices remains a challenge, especially when they are not labeled. Most labeling strategies consists in adding another compound (fluorophore, metal, lanthanide …) to the polymer, which can alter the NP properties and poses a risk of leaching phenomena. In the present study, we synthesized spherical and monodisperse 2H-labeling NP (129 nm) with carboxyl groups at their surface (8.7 nm−2) using surfactant-free polymerization. A pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method was developed to enable their quantification (limit of detection = 7.4 ng), without extensive sample preparation or significant matrix effects. The 2H-labeled NP were then used to study their toxicity and accumulation in the planktonic crustaceans Daphnia magna (D. magna). Daphnids were exposed for 48 h to the deuterated NP at different concentrations, including environmentally realistic ones (from 0.03 to 36 mg kg−1). Little to no acute toxicity were observed in this range of concentration. During the experiment, adsorption on polycarbonate well walls was observed, suggesting that the NP concentration during exposure experiments with organisms should be monitored to take into account possible loss. The NP accumulation (mainly in the digestive tract) increased with the exposure concentration, tending to a plateau at higher concentrations. The depuration was also investigated and was significantly higher (97 % against 59 % in average) when the daphnids have access to algae, which highlight the need to add food in D. magna depuration studies to study the NP fate in these organisms. The present study demonstrated the advantages of stable isotope-labeled NP to better understand the processes controlling NP accumulation and impacts on aquatic biota.
