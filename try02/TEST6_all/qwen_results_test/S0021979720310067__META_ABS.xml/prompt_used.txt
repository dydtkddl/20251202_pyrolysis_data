You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-step green fabrication of hierarchically porous hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNSs) from raw biomass: Formation mechanisms and supercapacitor applications Hierarchical porous hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNSs) were fabricated directly from raw biomass via a one-step method, in which HCNSs were obtained by thermal treatment of raw biomass in the presence of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The HCNSs possess coupling merits of uniformly distributed hollow spherical architectures, and high specific surface area, abundant accessible/open micropores and reasonable mesopores, the HCNS-based electrodes deliver high electrochemical capacitance. The formation mechanisms of pores and hollow core-shell structures were explored thoroughly, it is found that the key to the formation of hollow core-shell structure is the onset-pyrolysis temperature difference between raw biomass and PTFE. Moreover, the content of silica had significant effects on the textures of HCNSs, and HCNS with the largest SSA of 1984 m2/g was obtained. Accordingly, a possible mechanism of HCNSs formation was proposed here, where PTFE acted as the pore creation and nucleation agents and raw biomasses were the primary carbon precursors.
