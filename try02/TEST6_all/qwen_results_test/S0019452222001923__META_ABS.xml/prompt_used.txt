You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploration of biomass waste as low cost adsorbents for removal of methylene blue dye: A review Biomass waste, which is abundantly available has been studied as low cost biosorbent for dye sequestration from waste water. The present review reports on recent development for remediation of methylene blue dye by agricultural waste and fruit peel waste material. The aim of this study was to revise latest literature in the field of dye adsorption and discuss the dye adsorption capacity of different types of adsorbents. The activated carbon prepared from several types of biomass waste material enhances the adsorption efficiency after modification. The variety of activating agents, method of activation, characterization of biosorbent material like SEM, EDAX, BET surface area and FTIR analysis has been explored in the present review. The dye adsorption factors such as effect of pH, agitation time, temperature, adsorbate and adsorbent dose were discussed. The detailed investigation on applicability of isotherm model, kinetic model and thermodynamic parameters has also been presented. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm model focus on selectivity of adsorbent. Adsorption mechanism, Influence of surface area, influence of pHpzc and comparative study of biomass waste adsorbent with other adsorbents have been carried out. The use of biomass waste adsorbents is economically feasible, environmental healthy and found to have outstanding removal capacity of dyes.
