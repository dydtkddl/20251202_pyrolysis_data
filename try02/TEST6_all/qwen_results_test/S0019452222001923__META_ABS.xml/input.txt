Exploration of biomass waste as low cost adsorbents for removal of methylene blue dye: A review Biomass waste, which is abundantly available has been studied as low cost biosorbent for dye sequestration from waste water. The present review reports on recent development for remediation of methylene blue dye by agricultural waste and fruit peel waste material. The aim of this study was to revise latest literature in the field of dye adsorption and discuss the dye adsorption capacity of different types of adsorbents. The activated carbon prepared from several types of biomass waste material enhances the adsorption efficiency after modification. The variety of activating agents, method of activation, characterization of biosorbent material like SEM, EDAX, BET surface area and FTIR analysis has been explored in the present review. The dye adsorption factors such as effect of pH, agitation time, temperature, adsorbate and adsorbent dose were discussed. The detailed investigation on applicability of isotherm model, kinetic model and thermodynamic parameters has also been presented. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm model focus on selectivity of adsorbent. Adsorption mechanism, Influence of surface area, influence of pHpzc and comparative study of biomass waste adsorbent with other adsorbents have been carried out. The use of biomass waste adsorbents is economically feasible, environmental healthy and found to have outstanding removal capacity of dyes.
