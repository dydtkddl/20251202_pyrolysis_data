Advanced application of a geometry-enhanced 3D-printed catalytic reformer for syngas production Catalyst research on reforming processes for syngas production has mainly focused on the active metals and support materials, while the effect of the catalyst’s geometry on the reforming reactions has been poorly studied. The application of 3D-printed materials with enhanced geometries has recently started to be studied in heterogeneous catalysis and is of interest to be implemented for reforming biomass and plastic waste to produce H 2 -rich syngas. In this study, a geometry-enhanced 3D-printed Ni/Al 2 O 3 /FeCrAl-based monolithic catalyst with a periodic open cellular structure (POCS) was designed and fabricated. The catalyst was used for batch steam reforming biomass pyrolysis volatiles for syngas production at different parameters (temperature and steam-to-carbon ratio). The results showed complete reforming of pyrolysis volatiles in all experimental cases, a high H 2 yield of ≈ 7.6 wt% of biomass was obtained at the optimized steam-to-carbon ratio of 8 and a reforming temperature of 800 ° C, which is a higher yield compared to other batch reforming tests reported in the literature. Moreover, CFD simulation results in COMSOL Multiphysics demonstrated that the POCS configuration improves the reforming of pyrolysis volatiles for tar/bio-oil reforming and H 2 production thanks to enhanced mass and heat transfer properties compared to the regular monolithic single-channel configuration.
