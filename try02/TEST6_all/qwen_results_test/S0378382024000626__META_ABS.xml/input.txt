Two-stage co-pyrolysis of Kraft lignin and palm oil mixture to biofuels: The role of lignin as a methylation agent for methyl ester formation In this work pyrolysis of palm oil and lignin has been investigated using a two-stage process at 550 °C, with a first step configuration of continuous condensation for vapors and separation of gases, and a second step with distillation of vapors. Experiments were realized as pyrolysis of palm oil, palmitic acid, and Kraft lignin, as well as co-pyrolysis of palm oil/lignin, palmitic acid/lignin and palmitic acid/guaiacol. It has been shown that the addition of lignin improves the quality of palm oil pyrolysis bio-oil, thanks to the conversion of fatty acids coproduct to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The production of methyl esters in the reaction environment using palm oil and lignin was studied by conducting experiments with palmitic acid and lignin, as well as palmitic acid and guaiacol (the main product obtained from lignin pyrolysis). The results highlighted that during pyrolysis, the production of FAME is a consequence of a direct esterification reaction on palmitic acid. The formation of FAMEs during pyrolysis presents a promising avenue to optimize the utilization of palm oil by generating FAMEs as supplementary fuel products, Furthermore, it is possible to consider the application of the studied process for the conversion of free fatty acids into FAME.
