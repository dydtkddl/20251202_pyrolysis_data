Pyrolysis of PP and HDPE from plastic packaging waste into liquid hydrocarbons using natural zeolite Lampung as a catalyst This study aims to convert plastic waste into fuel oil through the pyrolysis process that assisted by natural zeolite as catalyst. Evaluation of the catalytic ability of natural zeolite was carried out in a batch reactor with various reaction conditions. The optimum conditions for pyrolysis of PP and HDPE samples were obtained by adding a catalyst of 7% and 3% (w/w) with an oil yield of 69.69% and 65.60% liquid fraction, respectively. The use of natural zeolite catalysts in the pyrolysis of PP and HDPE from plastic waste offered a simple method and demonstrated reliable catalyst performance.
