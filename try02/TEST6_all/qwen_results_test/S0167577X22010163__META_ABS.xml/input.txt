An innovative binary nano-catalytic flame retardant system for improving the fire safety performance of polypropylene Phosphomolybdic acid-modified reduced graphene oxide (RGO-PMoA) and nickel nanoparticles loaded with reduced graphene oxide (RGO-Ni) were synthesized. An innovative binary nano-catalytic flame-retardant system was designed and incorporated into the polypropylene (PP) matrix. Thermal stability and decomposition behaviors of PP nanocomposites were explored by Thermogravimetric analysis and Thermogravimetric-mass spectrometry, respectively. Fire behaviors of PP and its nanocomposites were investigated by cone calorimeter test. This binary nano-catalytic system with the optimal ratio is much more efficient than RGO-PMoA or RGO-Ni alone in improving the thermal stability and char yield, resulting in better flame retardancy. This combined catalytic system significantly reduces PP's peak heat release rate and total heat release. Its catalytic charring and flame-retardant mechanisms are revealed. RGO-PMoA, with solid acid characteristics, acts as a pyrolysis catalyst to accelerate the aromatization of PP’s decomposition products, and then the carbonization reaction catalyzed by RGO-Ni will be favorable. This work proposes a novel “combined catalytic charring strategy”, which integrates the advantages of nano-flame retardant technology and catalytic charring.
