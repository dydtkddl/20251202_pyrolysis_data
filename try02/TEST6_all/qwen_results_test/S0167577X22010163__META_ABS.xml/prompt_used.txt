You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An innovative binary nano-catalytic flame retardant system for improving the fire safety performance of polypropylene Phosphomolybdic acid-modified reduced graphene oxide (RGO-PMoA) and nickel nanoparticles loaded with reduced graphene oxide (RGO-Ni) were synthesized. An innovative binary nano-catalytic flame-retardant system was designed and incorporated into the polypropylene (PP) matrix. Thermal stability and decomposition behaviors of PP nanocomposites were explored by Thermogravimetric analysis and Thermogravimetric-mass spectrometry, respectively. Fire behaviors of PP and its nanocomposites were investigated by cone calorimeter test. This binary nano-catalytic system with the optimal ratio is much more efficient than RGO-PMoA or RGO-Ni alone in improving the thermal stability and char yield, resulting in better flame retardancy. This combined catalytic system significantly reduces PP's peak heat release rate and total heat release. Its catalytic charring and flame-retardant mechanisms are revealed. RGO-PMoA, with solid acid characteristics, acts as a pyrolysis catalyst to accelerate the aromatization of PP’s decomposition products, and then the carbonization reaction catalyzed by RGO-Ni will be favorable. This work proposes a novel “combined catalytic charring strategy”, which integrates the advantages of nano-flame retardant technology and catalytic charring.
