You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Stabilization of fresh and aged simulated pyrolysis oil through mild hydrotreatment using noble metal catalysts The nature and reactivity of the oxygenates, containing different functional chemical groups, and especially carbonyl compounds, render pyrolysis oil unstable. Alterations in physical and chemical properties of pyrolysis oil during storage and the catalytic stabilization of this oil is therefore critical and is the objective of the current work. In this study, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Rh/Al2O3, Re/Al2O3 and sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were employed in the hydrotreatment (180 °C, 60 bar H2, 4 h) of simulated pyrolysis oil to examine their effect on stabilization and potential polymerization routes. Of all the catalysts used, Pd/Al2O3 with well-dispersed metal particles, and a high char-suppressing potential was the most effective catalyst. It had the highest bio-liquid yield and the highest selectivity to low molecular weight stabilized oxygenates and deoxygenated products. In addition, the acidity in the light fraction was low and a very low solid product formation was found that consisted mainly of soluble polymers composed predominantly of aliphatic compounds and sugars, whereas insoluble polymers were not fully developed char. The solid yield increased in the following order: Pd (3.3 wt%) < Rh (13.3 wt%) < NiMo (13.6 wt%) < Pt (21.5 wt%) < Re (25.8 wt%) < Blank (27.4 wt%). This trend was also accompanied by an enhanced yield of heavy oligomers in the corresponding liquid phase abundant in phenolic compounds compared to carboxylic acids and aliphatic compounds based on GPC and P-NMR analyses. The Pd loading necessary to obtain a high-quality product was also assessed, and the lower carbon loss when using catalysts with smaller contents of metal was revealed. Based on the results a detailed reaction network was proposed regarding the reactions during stabilization of sugars, aldehydes, ketones, furans, acids and phenols present in pyrolysis oil. To delve deeper into the simulated pyrolysis oil properties, it was subjected to accelerated aging. Interestingly as much as 79 % of the feed was converted during aging. According to GC/MS analysis only large oligomers were formed that could not be detected. When removing the most reactive components from the feed, i.e. the sugar and furan, the conversion was lowered to 53 %. Catalytic stabilization was conducted on the aged oil and compared with stabilization followed by aging. The results showed that the solid formation increased from 5.1 to 9.1 % when the pyrolysis oil was first aged, followed by stabilization. A suggested reason for this is the large amount of oligomers that were formed during the aging. Thus, aging before stabilization is very negative for an industrial process.
