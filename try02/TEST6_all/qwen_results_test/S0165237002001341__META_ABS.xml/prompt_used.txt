You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Drying and pyrolysis of wood particles: experiments and simulation The objective of this study is to develop a flexible and stable numerical method to predict the thermal decomposition of large wood particles due to drying and pyrolysis. At a later stage, this model is applied to each particle of a packed bed and thus, forms the entire packed bed process as a sum of individual particle processes. Therefore, this approach can deal with particles of different sizes, shapes and properties. A general formulation of the conservation equations allows the geometry of a fuel particle to be treated as a plate, cylinder or sphere. The various processes such as heat-up, drying and pyrolysis are described by a set of one-dimensional and transient conservation equations for mass and energy. This allows for simultaneous processes e.g. reactions in time and covers the entire range between transport-limited (shrinking core) and kinetically limited (reacting core) reaction regimes. The particles interact with a gas phase by heat and mass transfer taking into account the Stefan correction due to the gas outflow during conversion. Experiments carried out span a temperature range between T=300 and 900°C for particle sizes varying between 8 and 17 mm. A comparison between measurements and predictions of drying models yielded satisfactory agreement only for the constant evaporation temperature model and thus, indicating, that the drying process is transport limited by heat transfer for large wood particles. Likewise, predicted results of pyrolysis for the above-mentioned range of temperatures and sizes agreed satisfactorily with measurements.
