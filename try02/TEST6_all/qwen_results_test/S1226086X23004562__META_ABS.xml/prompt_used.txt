You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deoxygenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids: How can we steer the reaction selectivity towards diesel range hydrocarbons? Fast pyrolysis is a prominent and versatile process that involves thermal decomposition of biomass feedstocks to produce high volumes of liquid bio-oil, which may eventually be upgraded via deoxygenation pathways (hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation, or decarbonylation) into high energy content green fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. The quality of the bio-oil, its thermal stability, heating value, and the efficiency of the total conversion process can be improved by deoxygenation over properly designed catalysts. Despite the success of the available catalysts to significantly improve bio-oil quality by producing useful aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolics, or alkanes, there are still opportunities for further improvements of the catalytic performance with regards to their activity, product selectivity and resistivity against deactivation. The present work provides a comprehensive analysis of the recent developments of sulfur-free monometallic and bimetallic transition metal and noble metal supported catalysts for selective deoxygenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids model compounds for biofuel production. The attention focuses on the design of active sites on these catalysts as well as the acidic nature of the integrated supports for selectively manipulating mechanistic pathways. Moreover, this review emphasizes on the role of doping in stabilizing metal oxides to tune metal-support interaction (MSI) and electron donation properties, all strategies combined for the enhancement of biofuel production. The novelty of this review lies on bridging theoretical and experimental investigations aiming at describing and interpreting deoxygenation pathways of vegetable oils and related model compounds. Current challenges and perspective are also provided.
