You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive study of thermal degradation behavior of carbon fiber flexible sucker rods: Product characteristics, kinetics and thermodynamics Carbon fiber flexible sucker rods (CFSR) are important as an essential component of oilfield extraction and their potential energy resource after decommissioning is very important. This research presents a detailed examination of the pyrolysis kinetic triplets and product characterization of CFSR that used a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The results revealed that the CFSR reaction interval was between 240 and 550 °C. Model fitting and the Criado method were used to determine the reaction control mechanism, and the average activation energies obtained by four model-free methods were 201.52(FWO), 201.93(KAS), 217.96(FM), and 202.29(Starink) kJ/mol. The byproducts consist mainly of acids, aromatics and hydrocarbons. In addition, the regenerated carbon fibers have a smooth surface and almost no residual resin as the temperature climbs to 600 °C. The results of the study facilitate the process optimization of carbon fiber composites and provide theoretical guidance and data support for subsequent development and utilization.
