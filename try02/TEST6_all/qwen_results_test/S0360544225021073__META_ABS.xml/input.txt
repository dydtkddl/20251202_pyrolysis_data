Economic and environmental analysis of a new sustainable multi-generation system for power, heating, cooling, freshwater, and hydrogen production This study presents a comprehensive assessment of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-based multigeneration system driven by biomass gasification, designed to address the growing demand for sustainable energy. The system integrates SOFC, gasification, transcritical carbon dioxide cycles, solar desalination, and proton exchange membrane electrolyzer to produce power, cooling, freshwater, and hydrogen. A case study was conducted across six diverse regions (California, Portugal, Pakistan, Australia, Morocco, and China), highlighting regional variations in efficiency and output performance. Key findings include a net power generation of 357.6 kW, a cooling load of 48.32 kW, freshwater production of 3.532 kg/h, and hydrogen output of 2.713 kg/h, with energetic and exergetic efficiencies of 41.42 % and 32.98 %, respectively. Economic analysis reveals a net present value of $1.803 million and a payback period of 3.16 years, emphasizing financial viability. Environmental evaluations yield a product impact rate of 31.747 mPts/s, identifying gasifiers and afterburners as major contributors to emissions. Sensitivity and optimization analyses refine system performance under variable conditions, while region-specific results underscore California as the most favorable location, achieving the highest net present value and freshwater production. These findings highlight the system's potential to solve critical challenges in clean energy generation, water scarcity, and sustainable, region-specific energy planning.
