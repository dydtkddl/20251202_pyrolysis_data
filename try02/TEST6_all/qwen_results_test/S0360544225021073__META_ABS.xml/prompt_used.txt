You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Economic and environmental analysis of a new sustainable multi-generation system for power, heating, cooling, freshwater, and hydrogen production This study presents a comprehensive assessment of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-based multigeneration system driven by biomass gasification, designed to address the growing demand for sustainable energy. The system integrates SOFC, gasification, transcritical carbon dioxide cycles, solar desalination, and proton exchange membrane electrolyzer to produce power, cooling, freshwater, and hydrogen. A case study was conducted across six diverse regions (California, Portugal, Pakistan, Australia, Morocco, and China), highlighting regional variations in efficiency and output performance. Key findings include a net power generation of 357.6 kW, a cooling load of 48.32 kW, freshwater production of 3.532 kg/h, and hydrogen output of 2.713 kg/h, with energetic and exergetic efficiencies of 41.42 % and 32.98 %, respectively. Economic analysis reveals a net present value of $1.803 million and a payback period of 3.16 years, emphasizing financial viability. Environmental evaluations yield a product impact rate of 31.747 mPts/s, identifying gasifiers and afterburners as major contributors to emissions. Sensitivity and optimization analyses refine system performance under variable conditions, while region-specific results underscore California as the most favorable location, achieving the highest net present value and freshwater production. These findings highlight the system's potential to solve critical challenges in clean energy generation, water scarcity, and sustainable, region-specific energy planning.
