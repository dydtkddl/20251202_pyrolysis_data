You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of pyrolysis technologies and feedstock: A blending approach for plastic and biomass towards optimum biochar yield The efficient and sustainable disposal or value addition of waste plastic has of major importance. Recent studies on the char produced via pyrolysis have demonstrated that it is a valuable additive with multiple applications ranging from soil and water amendment, improving agricultural yield, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and in support/catalysts, sustainable chemistry, and carbon sequestration. Thus, it is essential to ensure the quality and efficacy of biochar produced from any combination of feedstock and process to ensure maximum benefits. However, very few studies have focussed on techniques or process parameters to optimize biochar yield. This study aims to review pyrolysis techniques, reactor types, and pyrolysis parameters to identify the process parameters that could enhance the generation of biochar from co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass feedstock. This review discusses biochar production techniques, the mechanism of pyrolysis technology, pyrolysis types, and the reactor types. This is followed by a review of the factors that can be used to optimize biochar production. Accordingly, the review identified temperature, heating rate, reactor bed height and type, residence time, pressure, feedstock type and blending ratio of feedstock as the determinants that had the highest influence on the yield, stability, and carbon content of biochar. Most importantly, the technology readiness level (TRL) of biomass pyrolysis, plastic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic is discussed. The review necessitates further studies on these parameters to ascertain the accuracy of optimization that can be achieved by configuring pyrolysis processes to biochar production.
