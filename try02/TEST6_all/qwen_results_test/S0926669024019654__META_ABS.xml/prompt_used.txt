You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in engineered microbes for sustainable biofuel production: Current research and future outlook on lignocellulose utilization The upsurge in global warming, combined with the depletion of fossil fuels, has led researchers interested in other fuel sources. The search for alternative fossils moved towards the biological; degradation of waste biomass for the production of biofuels such as biohydrogen, biodiesel and bioethanol. The capability of biofuel production can be enhanced by the utilization of a model strain that holds the ability to operate at high substrate, transport sugar through deregulated pathways, and increase metabolic fluxes for improved production. Biofuel production by microorganisms shares similar properties with petroleum-based fuels. Achieving a sufficiently high yield of fuel necessitates the practical use of engineered microbes. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sources, pretreatment strategies, and production technologies involving metabolic engineering for biofuel generation. The lignocellulosic biomass has been identified as the major sources of biomass with physical treatment reported to be the most followed pre-treatment strategy. Metabolic engineering of microbes is preferred over other production techniques due to its higher efficiency, optimization of metabolic pathways, increased enzyme production and reduced by-product formation. The recent advances in engineered microbes focus on the optimization of metabolic pathways, CRISPR/Cas9, Gene Editing and modular engineering. This review also focuses on the economic and environmental concerns of biofuel production on feedstock utilization, management practices, and production scale. Finally, this paper highlights the future endeavours of the implantation of effective low-cost technologies for biofuel production in advancing culture conditions and genetic modification of biofuel-generating microbial species.
