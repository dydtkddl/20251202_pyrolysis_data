You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of oxygen-containing waste polycarbonate for the preparation of carbon nanotubes and H2-rich syngas In this study, ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of oxygen-containing polycarbonate (PC) was conducted to prepare carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and H2-rich syngas. This study examined the influence of the active metal components (Ni and Fe), catalyst pre-reduction, and pre-deoxygenation of pyrolysis volatiles on the catalytic performance and mechanism. Results show that the reductive constituents in pyrolysis volatiles make it difficult to reduce the Fe oxides, thus hindering the CNTs growth on Fe catalysts, compared to Ni catalysts. H2 pre-reduction of Ni and Fe catalysts enhances the generation of CNTs and syngas. The pre-reduced Fe catalyst exhibits better carbon deposit performance, reaching 263 mg/gplastics. The pre-reduced Ni catalyst better facilitates the reforming reaction of CO2 and H2O, resulting in higher syngas yields of 32.75 mmol/gplastics, with a volume proportion of 94.4 vol%. The addition of the deoxygenation catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 promotes the growth of CNTs with fewer defects and higher graphitization on Ni catalysts. The excess CO2 and H2O generated by the introduction of Ni/HZSM-5 may oxidize the Fe0 on pre-reduced Fe catalysts, inhibiting the growth of CNTs. The mechanism of the growth of CNTs and syngas from PC is also explored. The findings can provide theoretical guidance for the disposal of waste plastics.
