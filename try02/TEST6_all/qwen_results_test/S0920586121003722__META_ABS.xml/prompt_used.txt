You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments in polydopamine-based photocatalytic nanocomposites for energy production: Physico-chemical properties and perspectives Light-driven photocatalysis might address many global energy concerns due to its implications for hydrogen production and the imperative need to reduce fossil fuel dependency. Polydopamine (PDA) is a popular mussel-inspired material with extensive applicability in biomedical and drug delivery fields, which has recently been gathering attention in the fields of catalysis and photocatalysis. PDA is highly attractive for catalysis due to its large number of functional groups and its easy polymerization on virtually any surface. In photocatalysis, however, its properties have not been well described and strongly depend on the generation of heterojunctions (PDA/Semiconductor). In this review, we summarize the latest developments and studies on photocatalytic nanocomposites based on PDA. We will introduce general aspects such as structure and polymerization control. Then, we will focus on aspects of relevance for photoactive materials, such as chromatic control and electrical properties. We will present and discuss the recent literature on metal oxides and metal sulfides and some emergent materials focusing on photoactive and photocatalytic applications. Finally, we will outline some of the opportunities in the field. We hope this review serves as a reference for researchers and allows the growing community to focus on future developments for PDA-based photocatalytic nanocomposites.
