You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-Assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics: A comprehensive review on process parameters, catalysts, and future prospects The ever-growing consumption of plastic products has led to significant environmental concerns due to their persistent nature and inefficient disposal practices. Thermochemical recycling, particularly pyrolysis, has emerged as a promising method to convert plastic waste into fuels and value-added chemicals. Among pyrolysis techniques, microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) has gained considerable attention for its rapid heating, energy efficiency, and enhanced product yields. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the MAP of plastic waste, covering fundamental aspects such as feedstock preparation, selection of microwave absorbents and catalysts, and critical operating parameters. The impact of temperature, microwave power, catalyst type, and feedstock properties on the yield and quality of pyrolytic products, including bio-oil, syngas, and char—is thoroughly analyzed. Product characterization data and case studies from recent literature are synthesized in tabular and graphical formats. Special emphasis is placed on co-feeding strategies, hydrogen production, and the influence of catalyst structure on aromatic yield. Key challenges—such as hot spot formation, catalyst deactivation, and scale-up limitations—are identified. Finally, potential future directions are proposed, including the development of multi-stage MAP systems, integration with gasification processes, and pathways for industrial-scale deployment.
