Catalytic co-pyrolysis of Alternanthera philoxeroides and peanut soapstock via a new continuous fast microwave pyrolysis system Continuous fast microwave catalytic co-pyrolysis of Alternanthera philoxeroides and peanut soapstock was studied using HZSM-5 as catalyst. The effects of catalyst temperature, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio, and A. philoxeroides-to-peanut soapstock ratio on the yield and composition of bio-oil were studied. Experimental results showed that the optimum catalyst temperature was 400 °C. The catalyst increased the proportion of aromatics but reduced the bio-oil yield. The optimum feedstock-to-catalyst ratio was 2:1. A. philoxeroides presented a significant synergistic effect with peanut soapstock, which facilitated the production of aromatics in the bio-oil. The optimum A. philoxeroides-to-peanut soapstock ratio was 1:2.
