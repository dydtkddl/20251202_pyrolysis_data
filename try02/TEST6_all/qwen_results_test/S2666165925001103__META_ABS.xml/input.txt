Mechanical recycling of GFRP wind turbine blades: Evaluating the sustainability and economic potential of recycled fibers The significant development of wind energy over the past two decades has raised concerns regarding the End-of-Life (EoL) management of wind turbine blades, primarily composed of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP). This study investigates the mechanical recycling of GFRP from decommissioned blades and evaluates the reuse of recovered fibers in fiber-reinforced mortar and concrete. Mechanical testing showed tensile and compressive strength improvements of up to 13 % and 3 % in concrete, and up to 16 % and 17 % in mortar, with optimal performance at 2–2.5 % fiber content and 1–2 mm diameter. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) revealed that added fibers contribute less than 4 % to total environmental impact. On-site recycling exhibited lower impacts in 6 of 8 indicators analyzed, primarily due to renewable energy use. Economically, mechanical recycling can become competitive with landfilling when applied at scale under optimized conditions. Results support this method as a viable EoL strategy aligned with circular economy objectives.
