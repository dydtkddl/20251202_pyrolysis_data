Sustainable energy storage: Microwave-assisted repurposing of disposable masks This study investigates upcycling 3-ply surgical masks into activated carbon (AC) using a rapid, energy-efficient sulfo-carbo-activation technique driven by microwave technology. In under 60 min, with only 0.66 kWh of energy—57 % less than conventional methods—this process yields AC with a high surface area of 2056.75 m2.g−1. XPS analysis confirms that sulfonation stabilizes the polymer structure at elevated temperatures and introduces beneficial O and S doping. The mask-derived AC was employed for energy storage application and the capacitance of the developed supercapacitor was 374 F.g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV.s−1 in the three-electrode setup. The two-electrode symmetric device exhibited a promising performance with a capacitance of 112 F.g−1, a power density of 747.3 W.kg−1, and an energy density of 17.5 Wh.kg−1 at a current density of 1 A.g−1. Notably, it retained 97.5 % of initial capacitance over 7000 cycles in a 1.5 V window, showcasing robust cycling stability.
