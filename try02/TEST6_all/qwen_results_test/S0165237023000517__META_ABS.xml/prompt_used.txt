You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review of the correlative effect of process parameters on pyrolysis of plastic wastes Plastics contribute significantly to the plight of an ideal solid waste management system, and the dilemma of its safe disposal upon harnessing its untapped potential still looms large. An appropriate answer to such a predicament is an energy conversion technology that deems both economically and environmentally profitable. Pyrolysis of plastic wastes has been attempted for commercialisation unsuccessfully throughout the last decade, owing to the substandard economisation of the process and non-compliance of its products to emission standards. Though the pyrolysis technology and the parameters involved have been extensively studied, a gap exists in the practical implementation due to its complex mechanism involving many variables that play a significant role in products' yield, distribution and the system's overall performance. The present work strives to statistically analyse the effect of feedstock and other operational parameters on pyrolysis oil yield and quantify their impacts utilising Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The intensity and significance of the impact of the operational parameters are studied, and a ranking system is attempted to help in the technology's successful priority-optimisation technique and implementation. The results suggested that the reaction temperature is the most critical parameter, with positive PCCs of 0.857 and 0.855 for pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis, respectively. The percentages of Carbon and Hydrogen (H %), residence time, heating rate (HR) and amount of catalyst exhibited positive correlations with oil yield. Among the negatively correlated parameters, the moisture content in feedstock presented a high PCC of − 0.830, followed by particle size. This work presents a collective statistical quantification that aids us in the priority-based optimisation of the pyrolysis process.
