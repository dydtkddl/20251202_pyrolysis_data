Sustainable conversion of polypropylene into high-value carbon nanotubes using chelating agent-modified Fe/Al2O3 catalysts Waste plastics pose significant environmental challenges and require effective management strategies. Catalytic pyrolysis offers a promising route for converting waste plastics into high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs), thereby enabling cleaner and circular carbon material production. In this study, a series of Fe/Al2O3 catalysts modified by chelating agents were developed using ethylenediamine (EDA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydroxyethyl ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA). An acid-washing process was also employed during the preparation of the Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. The addition of chelating agents effectively enhanced the dispersion of catalyst particles, improving the yield and characteristics of CNTs from pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) plastics. Among them, EDA and HEDTA suppressed particle agglomeration and reduced the average CNT outer diameters to 15.9 nm and 15.2 nm, respectively. In contrast, EDTA led to the highest CNT yield of 280 mg/gPP, but resulted in a larger average diameter of 19.1 nm due to the weakened metal-support interaction (MSI) associated with its strong chelating effect. H2-TPR and ICP-OES analyses further confirmed that the incorporation of chelating agents effectively weakened the MSI, suppressed the formation of FeAl2O4 and improved Fe dispersion. It was also revealed that Fe3C may constitute the catalytically inactive phase, as indicated by the inverse correlation between the Fe3C particle size and the average CNT diameter. After acid washing, the CNT yield of Fe(A) increased to 315 mg/gPP. While Fe(A)∗, EDTA∗ and HEDTA∗ increased the average CNT diameter, EDA∗ exerted negligible influence. Following purification, the carbon material derived from EDTA exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 17080 S/m at 30 MPa, significantly surpassing that of commercial CNTs (8177 S/m). Furthermore, Raman spectra showed that the ID/IG and IG'/IG ratios of Fe(A) were 0.73 and 0.58, respectively, while those of FeEDA∗, FeEDTA∗ and HEDTA∗ were 0.49/0.82, 0.49/0.88 and 0.46/0.85, respectively. This process demonstrates a cleaner and efficient route for converting plastic waste into functional carbon nanomaterials. The findings provide a potential sustainable solution for plastic valorization and circular carbon material production.
