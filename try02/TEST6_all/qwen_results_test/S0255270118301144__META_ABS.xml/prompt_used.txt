You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis, characterization, and application of ruthenium-doped SrTiO3 perovskite catalysts for microwave-assisted methane dry reforming A series of ruthenium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3) perovskite catalysts were synthesized by conventional and microwave-assisted hydrothermal methods. The structure was analyzed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) confirming the formation of the perovskite phase with some TiO2 anatase phase in all the catalysts. Microwave irradiation decreases the temperature and time of synthesis from 220 °C for 24 h (conventional heating) to 180 °C for 1h, without affecting the formation of perovskite. A 7 wt. % ruthenium-doped SrTiO3 catalyst showed the best dielectric properties, and thus its catalytic activity was evaluated for the methane dry reforming reaction under microwave heating in a custom fixed-bed quartz reactor. Microwave power, CH4:CO2 vol. % feed ratio and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) were varied in order to determine the best conditions for performing dry reforming with high reactants conversions and H2/CO ratio. Stable maximum CH4 and CO2 conversions of ∼99.5% and ∼94%, respectively, at H2/CO ∼0.9 were possible to reach with the 7 wt. % ruthenium-doped SrTiO3 catalyst exposed to maximum temperatures in the vicinity of 940 °C. A comparative theoretical scale-up study shows significant improvement in H2 production capability in the case of the perovskite catalyst compared to carbon-based catalysts.
