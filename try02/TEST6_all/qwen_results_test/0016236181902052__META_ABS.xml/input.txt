Conversion of non-coking coals to coking coals by thermal hydrogenation Coking properties are observed in four non-coking coals, a lignite, a subbituminous coal, a semianthracite and an oxidized bituminous coal which had been treated by partial thermal hydrogenation. The effects of temperature, reaction time and hydrogen pressure on liquid and solid product yields are examined. Microscopic examination of the hydrogenated solid residues shows that they all contain structures somewhat spherical in shape which are associated with mesophase development. The dilatation, plastic character and free swelling index of the hydrogenated solid products were considerably better than those of the original coals. Dilatation residues produced from hydrogenated solids exhibited anisotropic structures.
