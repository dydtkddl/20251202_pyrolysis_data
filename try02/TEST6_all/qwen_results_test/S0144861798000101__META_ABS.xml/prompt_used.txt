You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solid state13C NMR investigation of lipid ligands in V-amylose inclusion complexes The characteristics of the ligands in inclusion complexes formed from stearic, palmitic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids, glycerol monooleate (GMO), glycerol monopalmitate (GMP) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) have been studied by13C NMR in dry and hydrated forms of the complexes, with13C labels being used for the car☐yl and C-1(3) glycerol carbons in stearic acid and GMO, respectively.13C NMR provides definitive proof that V-amylose inclusion complexes have been formed with the mono-car☐ylic fatty acids of varying degrees of unsaturation, GMO, GMP and LPC. The chemical shift of the mid-chain methylenes in stearic acid moves about 1.5 ppm upfield upon complexation with the1H rotating frame relaxation times becoming identical for the lipid and amylose. With the exception of docosahexaenoic acid, the mid-chain methylenes inside the V-helical segments have essentially the same chemical shift for all the other unsaturated fatty acids and lipids investigated. The cross-polarisation dynamics for the car☐yl and glycerol groups in stearic acid and GMO, respectively, have indicated that these bulky polar groups occupy highly mobile conformations in the hydrated complexes which must lie outside the V-helical segments adjacent to the amorphous domains.
