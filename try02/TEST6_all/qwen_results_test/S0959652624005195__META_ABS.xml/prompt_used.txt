You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-pressure oligomerization of diluted ethylene on a HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst The oligomerization at low pressure of diluted ethylene coming from secondary streams is an attractive route for hydrocarbon production, by means of a low cost and energy efficient process. To evaluate the viability of this process, the effect of dilution with N2 or syngas on the low-pressure oligomerization of ethylene (1.5 bar) was studied on a catalyst prepared with a HZSM-5 zeolite agglomerated in a mesoporous matrix of α- and γ-Al2O3, aiming to produce C5+ hydrocarbons (gasoline). The experiments were performed in a fixed bed reactor at 325 °C and a space time of 10.6 gcatalyst h molC −1. For an ethylene partial pressure of 0.33 bar, conversion surpassed 80 % and high C5+ hydrocarbon yield was obtained: >40 % with N2 as diluent; and, >30 % with syngas. The greater effect of syngas dilution on suppressing the formation of aromatics is explained by the role of H2 in decreasing the extent of dehydrocyclization reactions. The dilution of ethylene limits the extent of the reaction stages, but it also attenuates the stages for coke formation, by facilitating the diffusion of soft coke in the mesoporous matrix and contributing to decrease the deposition of hard coke in the zeolite micropores. Consequently, a pseudo-steady state of the catalyst is reached with a notable remnant activity for the formation of higher hydrocarbons.
