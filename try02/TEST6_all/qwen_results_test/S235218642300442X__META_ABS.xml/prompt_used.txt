You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent development in metal-organic framework-based hybrid nanocomposites for pollutants remediation from wastewater: Challenges and opportunities The ecological balance of natural water reservoirs has been disrupted by pollutants generated from agricultural, industrial, and human activities, resulting in significant impacts on human safety and environmental security. Metal-organic framework (MOF) composites have emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional adsorbents. These MOF composites exhibit remarkable capabilities for the effective removal of harmful organic pollutants from aqueous solutions. This review aims to critically examine recent advancements in developing MOFs-based adsorbents and photocatalysts for eliminating water pollutants. The review begins by providing a comprehensive overview of various synthesis methods for MOF composites, including solvothermal, hydrothermal, microwave-assisted, and mechanochemical techniques. Each method is thoroughly explained, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the review investigates the interaction mechanisms between MOFs and organic pollutants, specifically emphasizing MOF-carbon, MOF-metallic semiconductor, and MOF-polymer-based composites. This detailed analysis sheds light on the adsorption and degradation mechanisms for these new innovative materials. Importantly, this review paper not only summarizes the current state of MOF composites but also discusses the challenges associated with their large-scale production and practical utilization. The major issue addressed is the utilizing MOFs in powdered form, which presents handling and separation difficulties. To tackle this issue, this review proposes potential solutions to enhance the practicality and applicability of MOFs in large-scale applications. Overall, this review contributes to the ongoing efforts aimed at achieving sustainable water treatment.
