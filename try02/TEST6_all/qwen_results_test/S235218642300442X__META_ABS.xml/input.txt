Recent development in metal-organic framework-based hybrid nanocomposites for pollutants remediation from wastewater: Challenges and opportunities The ecological balance of natural water reservoirs has been disrupted by pollutants generated from agricultural, industrial, and human activities, resulting in significant impacts on human safety and environmental security. Metal-organic framework (MOF) composites have emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional adsorbents. These MOF composites exhibit remarkable capabilities for the effective removal of harmful organic pollutants from aqueous solutions. This review aims to critically examine recent advancements in developing MOFs-based adsorbents and photocatalysts for eliminating water pollutants. The review begins by providing a comprehensive overview of various synthesis methods for MOF composites, including solvothermal, hydrothermal, microwave-assisted, and mechanochemical techniques. Each method is thoroughly explained, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the review investigates the interaction mechanisms between MOFs and organic pollutants, specifically emphasizing MOF-carbon, MOF-metallic semiconductor, and MOF-polymer-based composites. This detailed analysis sheds light on the adsorption and degradation mechanisms for these new innovative materials. Importantly, this review paper not only summarizes the current state of MOF composites but also discusses the challenges associated with their large-scale production and practical utilization. The major issue addressed is the utilizing MOFs in powdered form, which presents handling and separation difficulties. To tackle this issue, this review proposes potential solutions to enhance the practicality and applicability of MOFs in large-scale applications. Overall, this review contributes to the ongoing efforts aimed at achieving sustainable water treatment.
