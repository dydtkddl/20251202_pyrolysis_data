You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of Mixed Plastics via Catalytic Hydrogenolysis over Layered Multifunctional Ru/Nb-MMT Catalyst Catalytic hydrogenolysis, as a relatively mature technique, has attracted considerable attention for plastic waste recycling due to its potential applications. However, existing processes are primarily limited to single-type plastics and are seldom effective for complex real-world mixtures, such as those containing polyolefins, oxygenated plastics, and chlorinated plastics. Thus, the development of multifunctional catalysts capable of efficiently converting mixed plastics remains a critical challenge. In this study, we designed a layered multifunctional solid catalyst, Ru/Nb-MMT, which was engineered by supporting NbOx species and Ru nanoparticles on montmorillonite (MMT) to synergistically activate C-C, C-O, and C-Cl bonds. Additionally, CaO mitigates the inhibitory effect of in-situ generated water by regenerating accessible active sites and thus restores catalytic performance. Moreover, Ru/Nb-MMT exhibits excellent dechlorination capability in the co-conversion of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), yielding over 99% non-solid products, demonstrating high efficiency in treating chlorinated plastic waste. The synergistic “layered mass transport–acid activation–metal hydrogenolysis” mechanism endows Ru/Nb-MMT with high activity, stability, and cost-effectiveness in the one-pot conversion of multi-component plastic mixtures (PE, PET, PPO, PC, PVC). This approach significantly simplifies the valorization of complex plastic wastes, showing great potential to improve process efficiency and economic viability, while also providing new insights for the design of catalysts in catalytic hydrogenolysis.
