Valorization of Mixed Plastics via Catalytic Hydrogenolysis over Layered Multifunctional Ru/Nb-MMT Catalyst Catalytic hydrogenolysis, as a relatively mature technique, has attracted considerable attention for plastic waste recycling due to its potential applications. However, existing processes are primarily limited to single-type plastics and are seldom effective for complex real-world mixtures, such as those containing polyolefins, oxygenated plastics, and chlorinated plastics. Thus, the development of multifunctional catalysts capable of efficiently converting mixed plastics remains a critical challenge. In this study, we designed a layered multifunctional solid catalyst, Ru/Nb-MMT, which was engineered by supporting NbOx species and Ru nanoparticles on montmorillonite (MMT) to synergistically activate C-C, C-O, and C-Cl bonds. Additionally, CaO mitigates the inhibitory effect of in-situ generated water by regenerating accessible active sites and thus restores catalytic performance. Moreover, Ru/Nb-MMT exhibits excellent dechlorination capability in the co-conversion of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), yielding over 99% non-solid products, demonstrating high efficiency in treating chlorinated plastic waste. The synergistic “layered mass transport–acid activation–metal hydrogenolysis” mechanism endows Ru/Nb-MMT with high activity, stability, and cost-effectiveness in the one-pot conversion of multi-component plastic mixtures (PE, PET, PPO, PC, PVC). This approach significantly simplifies the valorization of complex plastic wastes, showing great potential to improve process efficiency and economic viability, while also providing new insights for the design of catalysts in catalytic hydrogenolysis.
