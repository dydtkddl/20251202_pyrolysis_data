You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon-negative syngas production via CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic yard waste: A case study on horse chestnut shells Yard trimmings, a major component of municipal solid waste, are abundant and carbon-neutral feedstocks used for renewable-energy production. However, their complex lignocellulosic structures limit the efficiency of energy conversion via conventional biological methods. This study presents a thermochemical strategy for syngas generation from yard trimmings. Among these, horse chestnut shells (HCSs) are one of the representative types of yard trimmings produced in large quantities worldwide from ornamental trees. Given their abundance and sustainability potential, HCSs were selected as the model biomass for this study. Lab-scale pyrolysis was conducted from 100 to 640 °C at a constant heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a CO2 atmosphere, which enhanced the process sustainability by promoting gas-phase reactions with HCS-derived volatiles. In this setting, CO2 acted as a mild oxidant, converting volatile biocrude components into CO and facilitating syngas production. The incorporation of a 5 wt% Ni-based catalyst accelerated these CO2-assisted reactions, increasing the syngas yield (CO/H2 ratio: 3.7) by 2.51-fold compared to that of conventional catalytic pyrolysis under N2. Net CO2 emissions were reduced to −87.55 mg g−1 HCSs, indicating effective CO2 utilisation during the process. These results establish CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis as an effective method of valorizing lignocellulosic waste while contributing to CO2 mitigation.
