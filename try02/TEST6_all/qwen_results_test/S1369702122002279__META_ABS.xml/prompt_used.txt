You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive overview of carbon dioxide capture: From materials, methods to industrial status The separation and sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 is one of the most effective steps to counter global warming by curtailing the excess CO2 levels in the atmosphere. However, to achieve the global climate change targets, in addition to the capture of CO2 from the point sources, complementary carbon-negative technologies that capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere are also necessary. The most crucial aspect of any CO2 capture technology is the selection of a suitable sorbent, which is the most efficient in a specific temperature, pressure, and moisture range. The urgent nature of the CO2 crisis has led to overwhelming contributions from researchers globally in terms of different sorbents, measurement techniques, reactors, and processes. Additionally, to develop a commercially viable CO2 capture technology, a detailed and holistic techno-economic analysis is also vital. In this review, we have documented the recent progress on CO2 capture studies using different solid sorbents under various operational conditions, along with the methodologies and reactors used for these studies. Furthermore, this review presents a detailed account of the industrial status of various existing CO2 capture technologies, including direct air capture and its techno-economic prospects. This review aims to provide a bird’s eye view of the status of CO2 capture research with a particular emphasis on the most recent developments in this field.
