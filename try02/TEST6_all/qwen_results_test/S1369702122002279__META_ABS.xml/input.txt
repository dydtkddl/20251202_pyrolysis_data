A comprehensive overview of carbon dioxide capture: From materials, methods to industrial status The separation and sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 is one of the most effective steps to counter global warming by curtailing the excess CO2 levels in the atmosphere. However, to achieve the global climate change targets, in addition to the capture of CO2 from the point sources, complementary carbon-negative technologies that capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere are also necessary. The most crucial aspect of any CO2 capture technology is the selection of a suitable sorbent, which is the most efficient in a specific temperature, pressure, and moisture range. The urgent nature of the CO2 crisis has led to overwhelming contributions from researchers globally in terms of different sorbents, measurement techniques, reactors, and processes. Additionally, to develop a commercially viable CO2 capture technology, a detailed and holistic techno-economic analysis is also vital. In this review, we have documented the recent progress on CO2 capture studies using different solid sorbents under various operational conditions, along with the methodologies and reactors used for these studies. Furthermore, this review presents a detailed account of the industrial status of various existing CO2 capture technologies, including direct air capture and its techno-economic prospects. This review aims to provide a bird’s eye view of the status of CO2 capture research with a particular emphasis on the most recent developments in this field.
