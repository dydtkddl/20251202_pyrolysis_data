Characterization of multi-material 316L-Hastelloy X fabricated via laser powder-bed fusion The aim of this work is to provide firsthand knowledge of 316 L stainless steel (316 L) and Hastelloy X (HX) multi-material processing via laser powder bed fusion (PBF). Specifically, microstructure of the interface is studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface metrology is performed to characterize the resulting surface roughness at the interface followed by tensile and flexural testing of multi-material samples to characterize the mechanical properties of the interfaces. Results showed that use of proper process parameters for each individual material led to formation of a compositional gradient at the interface that stretched for 240 μm (10–12 layers) with no evidence of cracking or porosity. The interface exhibited higher surface roughness compared to 316 L or HX as measured by arithmetic mean height, Sa, and maximum valley depth, Sv, parameters. During tensile testing, samples failed in the 316 L region away from the interface, with comparable yield strength, ultimate strength, and ductility. Finally, it was concluded that the “naturally” formed interface created a compositional gradient which was defect free due to similar values of coefficient of thermal expansion, input energy density, and different Marangoni numbers of the materials.
