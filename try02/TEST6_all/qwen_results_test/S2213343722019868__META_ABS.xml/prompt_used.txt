You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on lignin waste valorization by catalytic pyrolysis: Catalyst, reaction system, and industrial symbiosis mode The lignin waste from lignocellulose biorefinery limits its green recycling development. Lignin is a kind of natural aromatic polymer with a complex three-dimensional amorphous structure. Catalytic pyrolysis technology has been employed to convert lignin waste into high-grade aromatic compounds, which can realize the full-component refining of biomass. However, the catalytic pyrolysis of lignin has faced problems such as low target product selectivity and poor catalyst stability, which affects the conversion efficiency and economy. This review aims to scope the latest developments the lignin waste valorization by catalytic pyrolysis from the aspects of lignin structure characteristics, catalytic pyrolysis mode, catalyst types, and catalytic pyrolysis reaction system, respectively. The latest aspects of catalyst and catalytic pyrolysis reaction system development in the lignin pyrolysis process have been emphatically analyzed. Based on a critical analysis of the scientific literature, the industrial symbiosis model of cross-industry comprehensive utilization of biorefinery lignin waste with a focus on catalytic pyrolysis technology was proposed for accurately incorporating catalytic pyrolysis technology into the biorefinery system. Finally, several perspectives on designing efficient and commercial application strategies of lignin waste energy utilization are addressed. This review can provide a scientific reference for further research studies on lignin waste residue produced by lignocellulose biorefinery.
