You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Xylanase increases the selectivity of the enzymatic hydrolysis with endoglucanase to produce cellulose nanocrystals with improved properties Enzyme-mediated isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is a promising environment friendly method with expected lower capital and operating expenditures compared to traditional processes. However, it is still poorly understood. In this study, an endoxylanase was applied as accessory enzyme to assess its potential to increase the selectivity of an endoglucanase during cellulose hydrolysis to isolate CNCs with improved properties. Only combinations of the enzymes with xylanase activity equal to or higher than the endoglucanase activity resulted in CNCs with improved properties (i.e., crystallinity, thermostability, uniformity, suspension stability and aspect ratio). The beneficial effects of the accessory enzyme are related to its hydrolytic (xylan and cellulose hydrolysis) and non-hydrolytic action (swelling of cellulose fibers and fiber porosity) and on the ratio of the enzymes, which in turn allows to tailor the properties of the CNCs. In conclusion, compared to the traditional sulfuric acid hydrolysis method, accessory enzymes help to isolate cellulose nanomaterials with improved and customized (sizes, aspect ratio and morphology) properties that may allow for new applications.
