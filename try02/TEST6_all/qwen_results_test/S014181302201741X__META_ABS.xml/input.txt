Xylanase increases the selectivity of the enzymatic hydrolysis with endoglucanase to produce cellulose nanocrystals with improved properties Enzyme-mediated isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is a promising environment friendly method with expected lower capital and operating expenditures compared to traditional processes. However, it is still poorly understood. In this study, an endoxylanase was applied as accessory enzyme to assess its potential to increase the selectivity of an endoglucanase during cellulose hydrolysis to isolate CNCs with improved properties. Only combinations of the enzymes with xylanase activity equal to or higher than the endoglucanase activity resulted in CNCs with improved properties (i.e., crystallinity, thermostability, uniformity, suspension stability and aspect ratio). The beneficial effects of the accessory enzyme are related to its hydrolytic (xylan and cellulose hydrolysis) and non-hydrolytic action (swelling of cellulose fibers and fiber porosity) and on the ratio of the enzymes, which in turn allows to tailor the properties of the CNCs. In conclusion, compared to the traditional sulfuric acid hydrolysis method, accessory enzymes help to isolate cellulose nanomaterials with improved and customized (sizes, aspect ratio and morphology) properties that may allow for new applications.
