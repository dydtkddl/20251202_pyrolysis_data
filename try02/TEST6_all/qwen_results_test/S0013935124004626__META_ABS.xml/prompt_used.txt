You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of char from pyrolysis of plastic wastes into alternative activated carbons for heavy metal removal The valorization of post-consumer mixed plastics in pyrolysis processes represents an abundant reservoir of carbon that can be effectively converted into useful chars. This process not only holds appeal in terms of improving plastic waste concerns but also contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, thus aligning with the principles of a circular economy paradigm. In this study, the char produced from the pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed plastic waste has been activated with Na2CO3, KOH, NaOH, and K2CO3 to improve the textural, structural, and composition characteristics, leading to improved adsorption capability. These characteristics were studied by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscopy, elemental and immediate analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The developed surface area (SBET) was 573, 939, 704 and 592 m2 g−1 for Na2CO3, KOH, NaOH and K2CO3 activated carbons, respectively. These activated chars (ACs) were tested for the adsorption of heavy metals in both synthetic waters containing Pb, Cd, and Cu and industrial wastewater collected at an agrochemical production plant. Na2CO3-AC was the best performing material. The metal uptake in synthetic waters using a batch set-up was 40, 13 and 12 mg g−1 for Pb, Cd and Cu. Experiments in a column set-up using Na2CO3-AC resulted in a saturation time of 290, 16, and 80 min for Pb, Cd, and Cu synthetic waters, respectively, and metal uptakes of 26.8, 4.1, and 7.9 mg g−1, respectively. The agrochemical effluents, containing mainly Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn were tested in a plug-flow column. The metal uptake notably decreased compared to synthetic water due to a competition effect for active sites.
