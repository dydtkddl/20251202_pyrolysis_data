You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coating super-crosslinked polycyclic aromatic molecules on hard carbon microspheres for a sodium-ion battery anode Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising contender for next-generation energy storage systems. Hard carbon is regarded as the most promising anode for commercial SIB, however, the large number of defects on its surface cause irreversible electrolyte consumption and an uneven solid electrolyte interphase film. An advanced molecular engineering strategy to coat hard carbon with polycyclic aromatic molecules is reported. Specifically, polystyrene-based carbon microspheres (CSs) were first synthesized and then coated with polycyclic aromatic molecules derived from coal tar pitch by spray-drying and followed by oxidation. Compared to the traditional CVD coating method, this molecular framework strategy has been shown to reduce the number of defects on the surface of CSs without sacrificing internal storage sites and suppressing transport kinetics in hosting the sodium ions. Besides the lower surface defect concentration, the synthesized hybrid carbon microspheres (HCSs) have a larger grain size and more abundant closed pores, and have a higher reversible sodium storage capacity. A HCS-P-60% electrode has a capacity of 332.3 mAh g−1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.5%. It also has a superior rate performance of 246.6 mAh g−1 at 2 C and a 95.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work offers new insights into designing high-performance hard carbon microsphere anodes, advancing the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries.
