Coating super-crosslinked polycyclic aromatic molecules on hard carbon microspheres for a sodium-ion battery anode Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising contender for next-generation energy storage systems. Hard carbon is regarded as the most promising anode for commercial SIB, however, the large number of defects on its surface cause irreversible electrolyte consumption and an uneven solid electrolyte interphase film. An advanced molecular engineering strategy to coat hard carbon with polycyclic aromatic molecules is reported. Specifically, polystyrene-based carbon microspheres (CSs) were first synthesized and then coated with polycyclic aromatic molecules derived from coal tar pitch by spray-drying and followed by oxidation. Compared to the traditional CVD coating method, this molecular framework strategy has been shown to reduce the number of defects on the surface of CSs without sacrificing internal storage sites and suppressing transport kinetics in hosting the sodium ions. Besides the lower surface defect concentration, the synthesized hybrid carbon microspheres (HCSs) have a larger grain size and more abundant closed pores, and have a higher reversible sodium storage capacity. A HCS-P-60% electrode has a capacity of 332.3 mAh g−1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.5%. It also has a superior rate performance of 246.6 mAh g−1 at 2 C and a 95.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work offers new insights into designing high-performance hard carbon microsphere anodes, advancing the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries.
