You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interconnected pyrolysis and gasification of typical biomass in a novel dual fluidized bed A novel 50 kg/h dual fluidized bed (DFB) was designed and constructed, and pilot study of interconnected pyrolysis and gasification/activation were conducted. Four typical biomass materials were investigated and compared in DFB system. Pyrolyzer temperature and riser temperature were 480–550 °C and 800–850 °C, respectively. Dolomite were used as bed material, and superheated steam was adopted as the fluidizing gas in pyrolyzer and transport gas in loop seals. Biochars were comprehensively characterized and analyzed, and were potential matrix for carbon-based materials. Biochar from wood sawdust was the best carbon-based material matrix compared to other biochars with the highest adsorption capacities of iodine (397.08 mg/g) and methylene blue (600.15 mg/g). Phenols and benzenes (total content of 63.26–97.36%) were the richest components in all bio-oils. Non-condensable pyrolysis gas from corn cob had the highest heating value (10.14 MJ/Nm3) and largest H2 content (23.91 vol%). The total energy yield was 63.54–84.95%, while energy efficiency was 63.79–82.47%. The carbon fixation ratio was in the range of 38.61–53.27% and the highest carbon fixation ratio was 53.27% from peanut shells. The advantages and feasibility of interconnected pyrolysis and gasification/activation technologies by DFB for biomass utilization and carbon capture were assessed in this pilot study. DFB is a promising technology to achieve carbon negative economy, and deserves more research in the future.
