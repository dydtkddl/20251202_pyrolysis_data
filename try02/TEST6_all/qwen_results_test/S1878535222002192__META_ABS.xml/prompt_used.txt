You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrafast 99% Polyethylene terephthalate depolymerization into value added monomers using sequential glycolysis-hydrolysis under microwave irradiation Effective and efficient hybrid depolymerisation technologies are emerging as high potential sustainable routes with considerable benefits over conventional recycling methods for the achievement of circular economies for plastics. Herein, combined green and fast glycolysis-hydrolysis depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was carried out under microwave irradiation (MW) with excellent efficiencies. In MW assisted glycolysis of PET, the catalytic activity of two deep eutectic solvents (DES) based on (choline chloride-urea (DES 1)) and (choline chloride-thiourea (DES 2)) was evaluated and compared. Optimised glycolysis conditions were determined using Box Behnken Design (BBD) to attain maximum weight loss of PET, low crystallinity and increased carbonyl index of residual PET. DES volume of 4 mL, 5.5–6 mL of ethylene glycol, and 0.5 min MW irradiation time resulted in a prominent rise in PET weight loss and carbonyl index of residual PET. DES 2 showed an improved catalytic activity than that of DES 1 which is associated to its stronger interaction with EG and PET polymer chains during the course of the reaction. Residual PET obtained post glycolysis reaction was further depolymerized using MW assisted hydrolysis in the presence of weakly basic Na2CO3 and EG. Within 3-minute, the proposed sequential depolymerization technologies facilitated ≈99% conversion of PET to terephthalic acid (TPA), monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET), and bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) monomers produced at a yield of 62.79–80.66%, 17.22–34.79% and 0.54–0.59% respectively. Application on post-consumer PET sample also revealed very satisfactory results with 96.77–98.25% PET conversion and 60.98–78.10% yield of TPA.
