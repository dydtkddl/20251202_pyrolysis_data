You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unscrambling why plastics aren't detectable in chicken eggs Several food groups have been reported to contain varying concentrations of plastics. This study was designed to quantitatively investigate for the first time in Australia the presence of plastics in store-bought chicken eggs. Three commonly consumed brands of free-range, free-range organic, barn-laid and backyard (home-laid) chicken egg samples were analyzed for seven common polymers (i.e., polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, poly-(methylmethacrylate) and polycarbonate). Samples were extracted by enzyme digestion and pressurized liquid extraction, followed by quantitative analysis through double-shot microfurnace pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. No plastics were detected at concentrations > limit of detection (LOD) (from 0.04 μg/g for PS to 0.22 μg/g for PVC) in the egg samples analyzed, regardless of brand and category, suggesting limited exposure of Australians to plastics from consuming eggs This study provides valuable baseline data and underscores the importance of continued monitoring to ensure the safety and integrity of food supplies in the face of rising environmental plastic pollution.
