Unscrambling why plastics aren't detectable in chicken eggs Several food groups have been reported to contain varying concentrations of plastics. This study was designed to quantitatively investigate for the first time in Australia the presence of plastics in store-bought chicken eggs. Three commonly consumed brands of free-range, free-range organic, barn-laid and backyard (home-laid) chicken egg samples were analyzed for seven common polymers (i.e., polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, poly-(methylmethacrylate) and polycarbonate). Samples were extracted by enzyme digestion and pressurized liquid extraction, followed by quantitative analysis through double-shot microfurnace pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. No plastics were detected at concentrations > limit of detection (LOD) (from 0.04 μg/g for PS to 0.22 μg/g for PVC) in the egg samples analyzed, regardless of brand and category, suggesting limited exposure of Australians to plastics from consuming eggs This study provides valuable baseline data and underscores the importance of continued monitoring to ensure the safety and integrity of food supplies in the face of rising environmental plastic pollution.
