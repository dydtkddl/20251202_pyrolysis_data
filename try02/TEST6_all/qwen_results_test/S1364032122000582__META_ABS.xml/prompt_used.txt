You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignocellulosic biomass as renewable feedstock for biodegradable and recyclable plastics production: A sustainable approach Rapid increment in fossil-derived single-use plastic disposal has led to human-made plastic mountains and leading to ecological imbalance. Therefore, the development of alternative environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and biobased plastics using lignocellulosic biomass renders sustainability. Lignocellulosic biomass offers an unprecedented opportunity to produce renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials for the replacement of fossils-based derivatives. The present review comprehensively delineates the potential of lignocellulosic biomass to produce biodegradable and recyclable plastics and plastic composites. Initially, various available pretreatment methods for the deconstruction of natural recalcitrance for fuel and chemical production are summarized, along with the challenges and scope of the integrated biorefinery approach. Energy chemicals such as ethanol, hydrogen produced under biorefinery approach may serve as precursor for bioplastics productions for sustainable bio future. Recyclable and biodegradable polymers such as polyglycolic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, polylactic acid, polybutylene succinate, polyvinyl alcohol, biobased polyethylene, biobased polyethylene terephthalate and cellulose acetate have been critically reviewed. Furthermore, the limitations, hurdles, and future scope of commercially available biorefinery industries are deliberated. Thus, technical development and integration in current biorefinery could promote the economical production of biobased biodegradable and recyclable plastics, simultaneously addressing waste biomass utilization constraints.
