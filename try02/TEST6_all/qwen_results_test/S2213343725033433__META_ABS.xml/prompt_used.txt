You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ordered mesoporous carbons: A catalyst solution for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process, which is known for its high energy consumption and pollution. The development of high-performance electrocatalysts is essential for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Carbon materials have been extensively studied because of their low cost, abundance, high scope for modification, and stable electrochemical properties. Among these, ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) have emerged as ideal candidates for the efficient catalytic synthesis of H2O2 owing to their abundant defect sites, numerous mesoporous channels, and large surface area. This review provides an overview of the H2O2 electrosynthesis over OMC catalysts and its application in the environmental field. First, the mechanism of H2O2 electrosynthesis using OMC catalysts is discussed. Next, we review the influence of structural regulation and defect engineering of OMCs, including modification of the pore architecture modification, oxygen-containing functional group alterations, and heteroatom doping. Then, the application of OMC for the degradation of organic pollutants in an electro-Fenton system is introduced. Finally, this paper discusses current challenges and explores future research directions, offering insights for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis and its environmental treatment applications.
