Ordered mesoporous carbons: A catalyst solution for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process, which is known for its high energy consumption and pollution. The development of high-performance electrocatalysts is essential for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Carbon materials have been extensively studied because of their low cost, abundance, high scope for modification, and stable electrochemical properties. Among these, ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) have emerged as ideal candidates for the efficient catalytic synthesis of H2O2 owing to their abundant defect sites, numerous mesoporous channels, and large surface area. This review provides an overview of the H2O2 electrosynthesis over OMC catalysts and its application in the environmental field. First, the mechanism of H2O2 electrosynthesis using OMC catalysts is discussed. Next, we review the influence of structural regulation and defect engineering of OMCs, including modification of the pore architecture modification, oxygen-containing functional group alterations, and heteroatom doping. Then, the application of OMC for the degradation of organic pollutants in an electro-Fenton system is introduced. Finally, this paper discusses current challenges and explores future research directions, offering insights for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis and its environmental treatment applications.
