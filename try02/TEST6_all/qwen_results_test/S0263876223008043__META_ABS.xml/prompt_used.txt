You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hindering nanoparticle growth in reverse microemulsion synthesized CeO2/γ-Al2O3 reverse water gas shift catalyst Efficient CO2 conversion to fuels and chemicals is of paramount importance for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions that accelerate climate change. In CO2 conversion reactions, catalyst nanoparticle growth and sintering under reaction conditions pose significant challenges, limiting the catalytic performance and catalyst stability. In this study, high surface area CeO2/γ-Al2O3 nano-catalysts were synthesized via the reverse microemulsion method and evaluated for reverse water gas shift. The effect of the active phase dispersion on the CeO2 nanoparticle growth was investigated via X-ray diffraction and gas adsorption. The 47.9 wt% CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst showed complete selectivity to CO generation, while attaining nearly equilibrium values for CO2 conversion at 600 °C and 8000 mL/(g h). As compared to bulk CeO2, nanoparticle growth in the CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst was hindered significantly, resulting in a relatively stable catalytic performance, similar to that of the bulk CeO2. Our findings reveal that the reverse microemulsion synthesized γ-Al2O3 support significantly decreases CeO2 nanoparticle growth and agglomeration. This reduction in nanoparticle sintering contributes to the enhanced catalytic performance and stability, facilitating efficient CO2 reduction.
