Technical review of metamaterial-integrated phase change material frameworks for metal hydride reactors Phase change materials (PCMs) are highly effective in thermal energy storage, absorbing and releasing large amounts of latent heat during phase transitions. This helps regulate temperature fluctuations in hydrogen storage employing metal hydride (MH) systems. However, the challenge lies in managing heat efficiently while maintaining the structural integrity of these materials over repeated cycles of heat absorption and release. This is where integration with structural design for the reactor plays a pivotal role. Metamaterials can be tailored to provide superior mechanical support, excellent thermal conductivity, and enhanced durability in PCM-MH systems. When integrated into PCMs and MH systems, metamaterials can create a composite structure that not only facilitates efficient heat dissipation but also ensures that the PCMs retain their functionality over long-term use. The use of advanced mechanical metamaterial designs addresses the issue of thermal expansion and contraction within the system, thereby minimizing material degradation and improving the system’s lifespan. This article reviews recent advances in embedding PCMs within metal-hydride tanks utilizing mechanical metamaterials. It first outlines the basics of MH storage, the thermal roles of PCMs, and key gaps in their joint use. It includes a comparison of heat transfer, load sharing, and manufacturability of the metamaterial, along with fabrication routes ranging from powder-bed fusion to casting. A numerical case study couples the PCM and MH governing equations in a gyroid lattice, validating the model and revealing faster charge–discharge times compared to finless beds. The obstacles then weigh in on material utilization, energy demand, and scale-up costs, flagging issues such as interfacial stresses and defects associated with additive manufacturing. The review closes with design guidelines and research paths toward reliable, large-scale PCM-metamaterial MH reactors.
