You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Technical review of metamaterial-integrated phase change material frameworks for metal hydride reactors Phase change materials (PCMs) are highly effective in thermal energy storage, absorbing and releasing large amounts of latent heat during phase transitions. This helps regulate temperature fluctuations in hydrogen storage employing metal hydride (MH) systems. However, the challenge lies in managing heat efficiently while maintaining the structural integrity of these materials over repeated cycles of heat absorption and release. This is where integration with structural design for the reactor plays a pivotal role. Metamaterials can be tailored to provide superior mechanical support, excellent thermal conductivity, and enhanced durability in PCM-MH systems. When integrated into PCMs and MH systems, metamaterials can create a composite structure that not only facilitates efficient heat dissipation but also ensures that the PCMs retain their functionality over long-term use. The use of advanced mechanical metamaterial designs addresses the issue of thermal expansion and contraction within the system, thereby minimizing material degradation and improving the system’s lifespan. This article reviews recent advances in embedding PCMs within metal-hydride tanks utilizing mechanical metamaterials. It first outlines the basics of MH storage, the thermal roles of PCMs, and key gaps in their joint use. It includes a comparison of heat transfer, load sharing, and manufacturability of the metamaterial, along with fabrication routes ranging from powder-bed fusion to casting. A numerical case study couples the PCM and MH governing equations in a gyroid lattice, validating the model and revealing faster charge–discharge times compared to finless beds. The obstacles then weigh in on material utilization, energy demand, and scale-up costs, flagging issues such as interfacial stresses and defects associated with additive manufacturing. The review closes with design guidelines and research paths toward reliable, large-scale PCM-metamaterial MH reactors.
