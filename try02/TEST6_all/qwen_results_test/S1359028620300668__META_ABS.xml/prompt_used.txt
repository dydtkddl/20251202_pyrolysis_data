You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

What’s new in ceramics sintering? A short report on the latest trends and future prospects Despite sintering has a history even longer than human civilization (its discovery dates back at least to 25,000 years ago), in the past decade, new exciting challenges have emerged in the field: reduction of environmental impact, densification of metastable phases, complete consolidation of ultra-refractory compounds, precise microstructural design to control properties of functional ceramics and integration between inorganic-organic compounds. In order to meet such challenges, new sintering routes employing electric fields/currents, water/solvents and external loads have been developed. The research also opened new questions about unexpected (and still not completely understood) interactions between electricity, presence of water/liquid, heating and diffusion processes. In this manuscript, we have rationalized the last-ten-years research in the field of sintering for the consolidation of ceramics. The processes are collected into three main groups: flash-like (sintering under relatively large electric fields and the material is internally heated by the Joule effect), spark plasma sintering-like (combination of pressure and limited electric field) and hydro-consolidation (sintering at temperature below ≈ 350 °C in the presence of a liquid under an applied pressure). This paper aims to point out common features and differences among different techniques. Finally, future research trends and new paradigm in material processing are anticipated.
