You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrochars of mixed marine biomass and plastic wastes: Carbonization scenarios and the performance as ketoprofen adsorbents The hydrothermal (HT) conversion of mixed biomass and plastic waste to hydrochar adsorbents has attracted significant attention; however, factors controlling the structure and adsorption properties of hydrochar remain still poorly understood. Herein, HT treatment of the marine biomass waste (crab shells (CR) and fishery waste-derived chitin (CT) and chitosan (CS)) mixed with plastic waste (polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) at temperatures of 200–250 °C and residence times of 4–12 h was conducted to prepare hydrochars for screening their adsorption characteristics towards ketoprofen, a pharmaceutical pollutant. PET underwent efficient degradation when processed with marine biomass, particularly in mixtures with CS, which facilitated PET depolymerization through an aminolysis reaction. Hydrochars derived from PET mixed with CS demonstrated adsorption capacities for ketoprofen of ca. 25 mg/g due to the presence of the amine, amido, and aromatic groups providing sites for electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and π-π interactions with ketoprofen. The ketoprofen adsorption was best described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich-type isotherm. On the other hand, no significant decomposition of PE was observed during the HT treatment of PE and biomass mixtures even in the presence of H2O2 oxidizer. However, the hydrochars of CS and CR prepared in the presence of PE exhibited markedly improved ketoprofen adsorption capacity compared to hydrochars of CR and CS. The results of this study demonstrate the benefits of combining plastic and biomass in the waste streams to control waste degradation along with the structure and adsorption properties of the hydrochars.
