You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanical performance enhancement of wire-arc directed energy deposited tungsten/steel multi-material structures through heat treatments Integrating materials with distinct properties (e.g., tungsten and steel) into a single structure offers significant performance benefits for demanding engineering applications. Among available manufacturing techniques, wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED) has gained attention for its capability to fabricate complex multi-material components with minimal waste. Nevertheless, the integration of tungsten and steel remains challenging due to their mismatched thermal and mechanical characteristics, which often result in high residual stresses and weak interfacial bonding. In this study, heat treatment was investigated to improve the structural integrity of wire-arc DED-fabricated tungsten/steel components. Instead of relying solely on experimental trial-and-error, simulations were employed to determine a suitable heat treatment condition—holding at 900 °C for 120 min followed by cooling at 5 °C/min. This treatment effectively relieved residual stress while simultaneously altering the microstructure: the tungsten alloy exhibited grain refinement, whereas the steel showed moderate grain coarsening. Mechanical testing demonstrated a 16 % increase in tensile strength, from 521 ± 4 MPa in the as-printed condition to 602 ± 7 MPa after heat treatment. Notably, the fracture location shifted from interface in the as-printed state to within the steel region after heat treatment, confirming enhanced interfacial bonding.
