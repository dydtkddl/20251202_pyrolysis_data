You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of a new combined method for pre-extraction of essential oils and catalytic fast pyrolysis of pine sawdust A new combined method for the pre-extraction of essential oils (EOs) and the uniformly dispersion of alkaline earth metal oxide (AEMO) on pine sawdust (PS) was investigated. EOs were firstly extracted from PS after mixing with a certain amount of AEMO through steam distillation (SD), and then the pretreated PS was utilized in the process of fast pyrolysis to produce the upgraded bio-oil. A maximum extraction yield of EOs was 1.61 wt% from PS mixed with 5 wt% CaO within 300 min, compared with 1.21 wt% from the control (raw PS). The proportion of alcohols in EOs increased significantly when using PS mixed with AEMO. When PS was pretreated by the combined AEMO mixing and SD, the content of hydrocarbons in organic phase of the bio-oil increased significantly while that of acids and CnHmOx decreased. The analysis of physicochemical properties for the bio-oil further demonstrated that the quality of bio-oil was improved based on the new pretreatment method. Furthermore, the maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C in almost all cases.
