  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study involves pyrolysis of waste reverse osmosis membranes, but the primary focus is on membrane capacitive deionization performance and DFT calculations, lacking measurable pyrolysis-specific experimental data such as product yields or catalytic performance."
