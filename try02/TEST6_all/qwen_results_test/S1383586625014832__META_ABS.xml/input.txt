Dissolved black carbon-FeOx precipitates as electron shuttles activate persulfate and facilitate Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle for efficient iopamidol degradation: Non-radical pathway and outer-sphere mechanism Iodinated X-ray contrast media, as a frequently used medical diagnosis in the imaging of internal organs, soft tissues, and blood vessels, are widely encountered in water environments because of their non-metabolic ability. Herein, a series of co-precipitates (DBC-FeOx) of dissolved black carbon (DBC) and FeOx were successfully synthesized. The chelation of Fe species with COO– groups in DBC enhanced the excellent electron transfer capability and persulfate (PS) activation performance of the resulting DBC-FeOx, thus boosting iopamidol (IPM) degradation. The IPM removal rate constant in the DBC-FeOx/PS was 35 times and 4.6 times higher than those observed in the DBC/PS and FeOx/PS systems, respectively. There existed an appropriate C/Fe molar ratio in the DBC-FeOx co-precipitates for PS activation, and the IPM degradation was driven by both radical and non-radical pathways. Fe sites were the primary active sites in DBC-FeOx for PS activation, and C=O groups played an important role in accelerating the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle by promoting rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing radical oxidation pathways. Concurrently, DBC-FeOx acted as an electron shuttle to promote the electron transfer from IPM to PS, creating non-radical pathways for IPM removal. IPM degradation processes involved amide hydrolysis oxidation, hydrogen extraction, and deiodination. The typical iodine species HOI was also converted to non-toxic IO3 - after IPM decomposition, thus reducing potential risks.
