You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dissolved black carbon-FeOx precipitates as electron shuttles activate persulfate and facilitate Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle for efficient iopamidol degradation: Non-radical pathway and outer-sphere mechanism Iodinated X-ray contrast media, as a frequently used medical diagnosis in the imaging of internal organs, soft tissues, and blood vessels, are widely encountered in water environments because of their non-metabolic ability. Herein, a series of co-precipitates (DBC-FeOx) of dissolved black carbon (DBC) and FeOx were successfully synthesized. The chelation of Fe species with COO– groups in DBC enhanced the excellent electron transfer capability and persulfate (PS) activation performance of the resulting DBC-FeOx, thus boosting iopamidol (IPM) degradation. The IPM removal rate constant in the DBC-FeOx/PS was 35 times and 4.6 times higher than those observed in the DBC/PS and FeOx/PS systems, respectively. There existed an appropriate C/Fe molar ratio in the DBC-FeOx co-precipitates for PS activation, and the IPM degradation was driven by both radical and non-radical pathways. Fe sites were the primary active sites in DBC-FeOx for PS activation, and C=O groups played an important role in accelerating the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle by promoting rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing radical oxidation pathways. Concurrently, DBC-FeOx acted as an electron shuttle to promote the electron transfer from IPM to PS, creating non-radical pathways for IPM removal. IPM degradation processes involved amide hydrolysis oxidation, hydrogen extraction, and deiodination. The typical iodine species HOI was also converted to non-toxic IO3 - after IPM decomposition, thus reducing potential risks.
