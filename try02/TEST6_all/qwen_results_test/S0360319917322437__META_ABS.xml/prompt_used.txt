You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-oil production from hydrothermal liquefaction of waste Cyanophyta biomass: Influence of process variables and their interactions on the product distributions Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste Cyanophyta biomass at different temperatures (factor A, 260–420 °C), times (factor B, 5–75 min) and algae/water (a/w) ratios (factor C, 0.02–0.3) by single reaction condition and Response Surface Method (RSM) experiments was investigated. By single reaction condition runs, maximum total bio-oil yield (29.24%) was obtained at 350 °C, 60 min and 0.25 a/w ratio. Maximum bio-oil HHV of 40.04 MJ/kg and energy recovery of 51.09% was achieved at 350 °C, 30 min, 0.1 a/w ratio and 350 °C, 60 min, 0.25 a/w ratio, respectively. RSM results indicate that effect of AB interaction was significant on light bio-oil yield. Both AC and AB had more remarkable influence than BC on heavy bio-oil yield and aqueous total organic carbon (TOC) recovery whereas BC was noticeable on ammonia nitrogen (NH3 N) recovery in aqueous products. By model-based optimization of highest bio-oil yield, the highest bio-oil yield reached 31.79%, increasing by 8.72% after RSM optimization, and light and heavy bio-oil yield was 17.44% and 14.35%, respectively. Long-chain alkanes, alkenes, ketones, fatty acids, phenols, benzenes, amides, naphthalenes were the main components in light bio-oil. Some alcohols, phenols and aromatics were primarily found in heavy bio-oil. Solid residue after HTL consisted of numerous microparticles (∼5 μm) observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) analysis shows these particles primarily contained C, O, Mg, P and microelements, derived from Cyanophyta cells.
