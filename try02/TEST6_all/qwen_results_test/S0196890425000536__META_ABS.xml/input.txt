Recent advancements in ammonia catalytic cracking and waste heat reforming technologies: A review Due to the challenges in hydrogen storage and transportation, ammonia is gaining widespread attention as a promising hydrogen carrier, aiming to advance the development of low-carbon and sustainable energy systems. To support large-scale ammonia applications in industry, low-temperature ammonia catalytic cracking (400–500 °C or lower) and waste-heat ammonia reforming technologies have emerged as key research areas. This work reviews recent progress in the mechanisms and kinetics of ammonia cracking reactions, introducing advanced ammonia cracking catalysts, including noble metals, non-noble metals, and multi-metallic systems. The discussion addresses optimization strategies, key influencing factors, and characterization and testing methods, offering clear direction for the development of cost-effective catalysts for low-temperature ammonia cracking. Moreover, this review introduces waste heat ammonia reforming technology applied to internal combustion engines and gas turbines, including the design of thermal coupling between catalytic reactor and combustor, catalyst performance, waste heat recovery methods and overall thermal efficiency, in order to provide recommendations and guidance for the development of ammonia-hydrogen conversion and utilization technologies in future energy systems.
