You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On deconvolution for understanding synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polypropylene The synergistic effects on syngas observed in co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polypropylene (PP) were systematically investigated on a fixed bed reactor with tailored feedstock configurations in this paper. The synergistic effects focused on evolutionary and cumulative behaviors of evolved syngas were quantified by juxtaposing the results from co-pyrolysis of pinewood-PP mixtures with weighted results from the pyrolysis of pinewood and PP as individual components. Examination of different feedstock configurations revealed quantified contributions on volatile interactions and catalytic effect of char to the overall synergy. Results showed that syngas yield, H2 yield and CO yield with co-pyrolysis were promoted by 27%, 80% and 63%, respectively, as compared to the weighted aggregates from individual pyrolysis. Reduced char residue and improved energy yield in co-pyrolysis contributed to a remarkable enhancement in apparent thermal efficiency from 69.93% to 80.67%. Interactions between volatiles evolved from pinewood and PP suppressed C n H m formation while significantly enhancing H2 and CO yields. Mutual interactions between the volatiles accelerated the evolution of each gas component during co-pyrolysis. Pinewood char showed a negligible catalytic effect in evenly mixed configuration, but this effect was pronounced in separated PP and pinewood char. The porous structure of pinewood char can be easily blocked by the fused PP during co-pyrolysis, which was responsible for the delayed C n H m and syngas evolution. This paper provides results that help assist to elucidate the detailed synergistic mechanism during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes.
