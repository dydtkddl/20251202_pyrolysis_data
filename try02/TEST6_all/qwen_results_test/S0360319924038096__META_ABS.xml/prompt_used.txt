You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of pyrolysis temperature on the optimal conversion of residual biomass to clean syngas through fast-pyrolysis/steam gasification integration The present work examines the performance of an integrated pyrolysis/gasification energy system, considering biochar as a key element of integration, and assessing the impact of pyrolytic pretreatment on the system behavior. Firstly, softwood pellet (SWP) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) were pyrolyzed using a screw-type reactor in semi-continuous operation (at 400 °C and 500 °C). The steam gasification of biochar at 850 °C was then simulated using a kinetic model based on the results of devolatilization tests performed in a lab-scale fluidized-bed reactor. The results showed that pyrolytic pretreatment significantly reduced tar contamination in the gasification syngas to 0.3g/Nm3, compared to 24.2 and 18.7g/Nm3 resulting for raw SCG and SWP, respectively. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluation of the integrated system confirmed that cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion efficiency of the integrated processes were not affected, despite the different quality of the syngas produced, also highlighting the differences in H2 production between the two feedstocks.
