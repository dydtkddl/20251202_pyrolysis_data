Plasma-engineered interfaces for next-generation biosensing Nonthermal plasma (NPT) has emerged as a transformative tool in biosensor engineering, offering unique capabilities in surface functionalization, nanostructuring, and reactive species generation—all under ambient, biologically compatible conditions. This review critically examines how NTP overcomes key limitations in biosensor design, including low sensitivity, poor biorecognition stability, and inefficient signal transduction. We discuss the physicochemical principles of NTP, its generation modalities, and the mechanistic basis for its interaction with biological interfaces. By enabling covalent biomolecule immobilization, tailoring interfacial energy, and engineering nanoscale topographies, NTP significantly enhances the performance of electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric biosensors. We also explore solutions to persistent challenges, such as plasma-biomaterial compatibility and process reproducibility, through adaptive tuning, biocompatible coatings, and predictive modeling. Emerging strategies integrating NTP with nanostructured films, microfluidics, and AI-guided biosensor architectures are highlighted as the next frontier. Collectively, this review positions NTP not merely as a modification method but as a functional architect of intelligent, multiplexed biosensing platforms. Its role in enabling real-time, minimally invasive diagnostics for personalized healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable technologies underscores its transformative potential in next-generation bioanalytical systems.
