You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plasma-engineered interfaces for next-generation biosensing Nonthermal plasma (NPT) has emerged as a transformative tool in biosensor engineering, offering unique capabilities in surface functionalization, nanostructuring, and reactive species generation—all under ambient, biologically compatible conditions. This review critically examines how NTP overcomes key limitations in biosensor design, including low sensitivity, poor biorecognition stability, and inefficient signal transduction. We discuss the physicochemical principles of NTP, its generation modalities, and the mechanistic basis for its interaction with biological interfaces. By enabling covalent biomolecule immobilization, tailoring interfacial energy, and engineering nanoscale topographies, NTP significantly enhances the performance of electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric biosensors. We also explore solutions to persistent challenges, such as plasma-biomaterial compatibility and process reproducibility, through adaptive tuning, biocompatible coatings, and predictive modeling. Emerging strategies integrating NTP with nanostructured films, microfluidics, and AI-guided biosensor architectures are highlighted as the next frontier. Collectively, this review positions NTP not merely as a modification method but as a functional architect of intelligent, multiplexed biosensing platforms. Its role in enabling real-time, minimally invasive diagnostics for personalized healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable technologies underscores its transformative potential in next-generation bioanalytical systems.
