You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Confined dissipation cage in dual-shell structured Ti3C2Tx@CNTs/Ni hollow spheres for lightweight and broadband electromagnetic wave absorption Ti3C2Tx can dissipate energy well due to its high conductivity, but at the expense of severe electromagnetic (EM) wave reflection, which is exacerbated by self-stacking. Despite various attempts to tackle this problem, the excessive isolation of Ti3C2Tx and massive high-density inorganic components render these designs unfavorable for lightweight and broadband absorption. Meanwhile, improvements in absorption performance are related to active surface and polarization interface expansion, as well as conductive path reconstruction, but the main contributing factor remains unknown. In this work, the dual-shell structured Ti3C2Tx@CNTs/Ni-HS (hollow sphere) composites are fabricated. This structure creates a confined dissipation cage, where the CNTs/Ni shell confines the electron transfer among spheres and prevents self-restacking and the tightly contacted Ti3C2Tx shell forms an uninterrupted conductive path for effective dissipation. Therefore, Ti3C2Tx@CNTs/Ni-HS-1 exhibits a broad effective absorption band of 6.1 GHz and a minimum reflection loss of −64.6 dB at a mass ratio of only 15 wt%. Importantly, when hollow structure cracks, although large active surface and polarizable interface remain, the absorption capacity of fragmented Ti3C2Tx@CNTs/Ni-HS-1 deteriorates, indicating rational conductive path in confined dissipation cage is the main factor in achieving excellent performance. This work provides new insight for the rational design of high-performance absorbers.
