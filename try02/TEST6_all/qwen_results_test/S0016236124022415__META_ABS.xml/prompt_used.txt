You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An experimental investigation on performance, emission and combustion characteristics of IC engine using liquid fuel produced through catalytic co-pyrolysis of pressed oil cake and mixed plastics with the addition of nanoparticles The study focuses on using a combination of diesel and a liquid fuel derived from the co-pyrolysis of pressed neem cake (PNC) and mixed waste plastics (MWP) containing waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) in equal amounts with the help of cupric oxide (CuO) catalyst. The engine analysis was carried out using diesel and five different blends of co-pyrolysis oil with diesel in proportions of 20 % (20 % pyrolysis oil + 80 % diesel = PD20), 40 % (PD40), 50 % (PD50) and 100 % pyrolysis oil (PD100), respectively. Initially, the co-pyrolysis oil was produced using PNC and MWP in a ratio of 1:2 under different operating temperatures between 350 °C and 650 °C. The process temperature was optimized to yield maximum liquid oil, and the characterization study was performed. In addition to that, CeO2 nanoadditives were used to improve the properties of PD20 fuel. Different dosages of nanoadditives were blended with PD20 to prepare PD20@25 (PD20 + 25 ppm CeO2), PD20@50, PD20@75, and PD20@100. The objective of the study is to assess the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine utilizing co-pyrolysis oil-diesel blend by including the nanoadditives. The analysis was carried out on a single-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine mounted with an eddy current dynamometer. The experiments demonstrated that the combination of PD20 and 50 ppm CeO2 resulted in a 6 % increase in thermal efficiency when compared to other blended fuels and diesel. When compared to all fuels, the PD20@50 produced a higher decrease in CO and HC emissions by roughly 30 and 6.2 %, respectively. The combustion analysis showed that the heat release rate (HRR) and maximum cylinder pressure were also found to have improved by adding nanoparticles.
