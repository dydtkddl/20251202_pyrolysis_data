You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Self-activated pyrolytic synthesis of S, N and O co-doped porous carbon derived from discarded COVID-19 masks for lithium sulfur batteries The continuous spread of COVID-19 has produced a large number of abandoned disposable medical masks (DMMs), which have a greater negative impact on the environment and biosafety. In response to this issue, a method for rapid microwave sulfonation, nitrification and oxidation of DMMs was proposed to convert DMMs with low carbonization efficiency into aromatic carbon with good thermal stability, which not only maintained 51 wt% of initial mass at 1000 °C, but also achieved in situ co-doping of S, N and O. Subsequently, porous carbons derived from DMMs were synthesized by self-activation pyrolysis, which avoided consumption of alkali and metal salts in the traditional activation process. It was further found that low pyrolysis temperature was not enough to produce enough active material H2 and H2O to obtain high specific surface area, while increasing pyrolysis temperature could adjust the specific surface area of as-prepared carbon, ranging from 52 m2·g−1 to as high as 890 m2 g−1. Thanks to synergistic effect of S, N, and O co-doping and hierarchical porous structure, the first discharge specific capacity of sample synthesized by self-activated pyrolysis at 900 °C was 1459.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C, and the discharge specific capacity retention at 0.5 C after 400 cycles was 52.3%.
