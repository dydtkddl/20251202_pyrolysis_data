You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence laws of operating parameters on coal pyrolysis characteristics Pyrolysis is a vital route to achieve clean and efficient utilization of coal. This work comprehensively summarizes coal macromolecular structures, and reaction mechanism, influencing laws of main operating factors of coal pyrolysis, as well as its co-pyrolysis with biomass. Coal pyrolysis originates from the cracking of its organic matters, which are composed of inordinately complicated 3-D macromolecular networks with interconnected pores. The whole process is complicated, undergoes five stages and its product compositions and properties vary with diverse reaction conditions. Temperature is the most influencing parameter to determine process extent and a high temperature dramatically cracks coal, which is favorable for volatile yield improvement. Coal type, particle size, atmosphere, pressure, heating rate, catalyst insertion, etc. also impact the process and modify product distribution and characteristics. Desirable target effect can be achieved by proper process parameters regulation. The addition of biomass can also optimize pyrolysis process, which promotes feedstock utilization efficiency simultaneously. Synergistic effects can be found during co-pyrolysis of coal and biomass, and high hydrogen content and inorganic components in biomass are responsible for the synergistic effects.
