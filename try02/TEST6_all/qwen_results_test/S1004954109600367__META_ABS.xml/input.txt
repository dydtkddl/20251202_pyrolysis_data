Establishment of Kinetic Model for Catalytic Pyrolysis of Daqing Atmospheric Residue An 8-lump kinetic model was proposed to predict the yields of propylene, ethylene and gasoline in thecatalytic pyrolysis process of Daqing atmospheric residue. The model contains 21 kinetic parameters and one for catalyst deactivation. A series of experiments were carried out in a riser reactor over catalyst named LTB-2. The kinetic parameters were estimated by using sub-model method, and apparent activation energies were calculated according to the Arrhenius equation. The predicted yields coincided well with the experimental values. It shows thatthe kinetic parameters estimated by using the sub-model method were reliable.
