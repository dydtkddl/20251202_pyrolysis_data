You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal liquefaction: A promising technology for renewable energy and environmental clean-up applications Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has emerged as an effective thermochemical technology that sustainably converts wet biomass into biocrude, which is the most significant precursor for renewable energy applications such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It has also been deployed for addressing environmental challenges such as removing hazardous contaminants. The ultimate aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art HTL research, focusing on its potential applications in biocrude and environmental remediation. The review covers various biomass feedstocks, process parameters, and other aid-in methods underlying HTL. Key findings from recent studies are discussed, highlighting the efficiency of HTL in producing biocrude oil, higher heating value, and energy recovery. Likewise, the advantages and disadvantages of integrating HTL and anaerobic digestion with respect to addressing downstream waste are explored. The current studies and limitations of biocrude-based SAF have been updated. Furthermore, the review summarises the critical role of HTL in removing environmental pollutants (e.g., PFAS, microplastic, bioactive/organic contaminants, and heavy metals). Finally, a discussion of the challenges (e.g., the variability and inconsistency of the feedstock, process optimisation, biocrude quality, etc.) and future prospects for HTL technology, emphasising its role in promoting sustainable and clean energy solutions, will be concluded.
