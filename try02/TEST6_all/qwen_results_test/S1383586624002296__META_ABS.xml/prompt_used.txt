You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste PET-derived MOF-5 for high-efficiency removal of tetracycline Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accounts for 40 % of discarded plastics, and its recycling products have outstanding environmental protection and energy-saving performance, so how to improve the current low recycling rate of waste PET has caught increasing attention. In this paper, waste PET plastic was depolymerized to prepare terephthalic acid (TPA) as an organic linker to synthesize MOF-5. MOF-5 was applied to the adsorption of tetracycline (TC). The batch experiments exhibited that kinetic and isotherm data best fitted the pseudo-first-order model and Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 2325.55 mg g-1. The regeneration rate of MOF-5 at the fifth cycle was 85.51 %. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy both indicated the main adsorption mechanism of MOF-5 toward TC could be attributed to hydrogen bonding and the ionic interactions between the unsaturated bonds (C=O and O–C=O) in MOF-5 and TC molecules. Alginate hydrogel with 30–150 mg MOF-5 loading provided better adsorption performance toward TC than MOF-5 powder, and 90 mg MOF-5 loaded hydrogel performed the highest removal rate of 66.28 %. This work proposed a novel method using waste plastics as raw materials to synthesize pollutant adsorbent, which had an enlightening effect on pollutant treatment.
