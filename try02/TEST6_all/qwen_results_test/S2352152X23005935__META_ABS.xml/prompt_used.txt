You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State-of-the-art hydrogen generation techniques and storage methods: A critical review Hydrogen is a clean, versatile, and energy-dense fuel that has the potential to play a key role in a low-carbon energy future. However, realizing this potential requires the development of efficient and cost-effective hydrogen generation and storage technologies. Hydrogen can be generated from a variety of sources, including fossil fuels, biomass, and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. In regard to the renewable energy sources, this paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art in hydrogen generation methods including water electrolysis, gasification, dark fermentation, steam reforming, photocatalytic water splitting and water thermolysis. Further, this paper presents a review of the various hydrogen storage methods, including compression, liquefaction, liquid organic carriers, and solid-state storage. These technologies offer the potential for improved efficiency, safety, and environmental performance, and may play a key role in the transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. Finally, the advantages and challenges of hydrogen energy, and future perspectives on the improvement of hydrogen storage methods are well emphasized. Overall, the development of efficient and cost-effective hydrogen generation and storage technologies is essential for the widespread adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy source. Continued research and development in this field will be critical to advancing the state-of-the-art and realizing the full potential of hydrogen as a key element in a sustainable energy future.
