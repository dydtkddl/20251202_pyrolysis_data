RETRACTED: Utilization of agricultural lignocellulosic wastes for biofuels and green diesel production This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief. A journal-wide investigation by Elsevier’s Research Integrity & Publishing Ethics team identified violations of the journal’s policies on conflict of interest related to the submission and review of this paper. Review of this submission was handled by Guest Editor Wei-Hsin Chen despite an extensive record of collaboration, including co-publication, with one of the paper co-authors (Kit Wayne Chew). Acceptance of the article was partly based upon the positive advice of reviewers who were closely linked to one of the authors (Chew). This compromised the editorial process and breached the journal’s policies. The authors disagree with this retraction and dispute the grounds for it.
