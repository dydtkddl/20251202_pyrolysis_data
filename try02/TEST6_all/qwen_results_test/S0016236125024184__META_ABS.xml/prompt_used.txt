You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improving the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene and polypropylene with acidic clay catalysts using pre-degradation method Catalytic pyrolysis of plastics with clay catalysts was studied using pyrolysis reactor experiments and GC analysis of the formed liquid. In quest for improving the quantity and quality of the product yields, during catalytic pyrolysis of plastic pellets rather than fine powder, pre-degradation was used as a pre-treatment method. A detailed study of the effect of various experimental conditions of the method was carried out and applied to the catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins with clay catalysts. As revealed by the experiments, pre-degradation as a pre-treatment method increased the liquid yield while decreased the coke yield compared to conventional mixing with optimal operating conditions of 150 °C temperature and 10 min holding time. Increasing the temperature or reaction time beyond this limit continued to decrease coke yield and improved coke volatility but decreased liquid yield. No coke from normal mixing volatilised below 500 °C, in contrast to pre-degradation pyrolysis coke, in particular at holding times of 10 min and above. Furthermore, specific effects of clay based catalyst type and polymer type were investigated on liquid product yield as well as product distribution.
