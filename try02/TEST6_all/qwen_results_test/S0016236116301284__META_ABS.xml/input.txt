Production of green aromatics via catalytic cracking of Canola Oil Methyl Ester (CME) using HZSM-5 catalyst with different Si/Al ratios This research paper has focused on the production of green aromatics from Canola Oil Methyl Ester (CME). In order to evaluate the aromatic production statistically, General Factorial Design (GFD) was utilized. HZSM-5 catalyst with two different Si/Al ratios of 50 and 80 was applied in the experiments. The effects of two operating parameters namely reaction temperature and Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV) on aromatic products yield were examined. Temperature of the reaction was varied in the range of 375–500°C while WHSV was either 2 or 4h−1. CME was catalytically cracked in a tubular reactor inside a furnace using HZSM-5 catalyst. The major products were hydrocarbon liquid, gases and water. Liquid Hydrocarbon Product (LHP) was analyzed using Gas Chromatography (GC) in order to determine the aromatic content specifically BTX. The results showed that the temperature and WHSV are significant parameters in production of aromatics from methyl ester. Both catalysts yielded toluene as a major aromatic compound followed by Para–Meta xylenes and benzene. It was found that HZSM-5 with lower Si/Al ratio is a promising catalyst for production of aromatics from long chain methyl esters.
