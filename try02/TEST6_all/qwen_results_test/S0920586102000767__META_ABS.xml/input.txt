Polymer waste recycling over “used” catalysts Catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was carried out under nitrogen using a laboratory fluidised bed reactor operating at 360°C with catalyst to polymer feed ratio of 2:1 and at 450°C with catalyst to polymer feed ratio of 6:1 under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts used in this study were ZSM-5, US-Y, ASA, fresh FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) commercial catalyst (Cat-A) and equilibrium FCC catalysts with different levels of metal poisoning were studied. The initial results for polymer degradation at 360°C (catalyst to polymer ratio of 2:1) in a fluidised bed reactor in terms of the yield of volatile hydrocarbon products were: model catalysts>commercial FCC catalyst>E-Cats. However, when the process conditions more closely resembled to FCC conditions, the fresh commercial FCC catalyst was more favourable in terms of the yield of volatile hydrocarbon products. The degradation of HDPE over E-Cats although reduced was similar to ASA in product selectivity and yield, and the level of metal contamination did not affect the product stream generated. A simple economic evaluation of polymer recycling process is reported showing that a catalytic system based on E-Cats appears comparable in costs to a commercial thermal cracking plant.
