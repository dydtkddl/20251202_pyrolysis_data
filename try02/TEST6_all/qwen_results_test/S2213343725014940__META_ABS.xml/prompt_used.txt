You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treating waste with waste: Spent bleaching earth-derived hydrochars for water decontamination via a heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction Upcycling spent bleaching earth (SBE) into value-added carbonaceous catalysts for sustainable water treatment remains a challenge. In this study, we developed carbonaceous catalysts derived from SBE to address issues associated with SBE disposal in the oil refining process and the decontamination of organic pollutants from water. Specifically, SBE-derived hydrochars were explored as effective catalysts for Fenton-like reactions to remove antibiotic tetracycline (TC). Hydrochar pyrolyzed at 600 °C (HSBEC-600) exhibited a significant TC removal efficiency, achieving nearly 100 % removal within 25 min. Compared to pyrochar (direct pyrolysis of SBE at 600 °C), HSBEC-600 exhibited a 1.4-fold increase in TC removal efficiency, primarily due to its higher content of surface oxygenated functional groups. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) collectively confirmed the dominant role of hydroxyl radical (HO•). Theoretical calculations elucidated the critical role of C꞊O sites of hydrochar in activating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), with the *OOH intermediate facilitating peroxygen bond cleavage to produce HO•. Toxicity assessments of the TC degradation intermediates inferred a reduction in toxicity after the degradation reaction. Moreover, the HSBEC-600/H2O2 system exhibited excellent adaptability across a wide pH range (3.2–11.4) and maintained high TC removal efficiency (>90 %) with different real water matrices. This study proposes a feasible strategy for the rational design of SBE-based catalysts, facilitating the utilization of SBE resources and water remediation.
