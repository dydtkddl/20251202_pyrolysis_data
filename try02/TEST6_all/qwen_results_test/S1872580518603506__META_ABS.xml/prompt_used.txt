You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and process optimization of randomly oriented C/C composites by a novel method Conventional ways of fabricating C/C composites are unable to achieve wetting in the core of the carbon fiber tow by molten pitch because a single tow has thousands of fibers. Pitch stabilization after infiltration into the carbon fiber preform results in local oozing of the pitch and a non-uniform microstructure due to non-uniform pitch stabilization in the preform. The objective of this research was to devise a method by which complete wetting of fibers in the tow with mesophase pitch is attained by mixing stabilized pitch and chopped and scattered carbon fibers, followed by hot-pressing and carbonization. The influence of process parameters on the carbon yield of the stabilized mesophase pitch is evaluated. The carbon yield divided by processing time and the carbon yield multiplied by the ratio of the apparent density to real density of the C/C composites are used to optimize process parameters. Results show that complete wetting of fibers with mesophase pitch is attained by this method. The carbon yield of the stabilized mesophase pitch decreases with heating rate and the mass ratio of stabilized pitch to carbon fibers, and increases with hot-pressing pressure. At high pressures and high mass ratios, local oozing of the stabilized pitch occurs. The optimum C/C composite was prepared under a hot-pressing pressure of 15 MPa, a heating rate of 0.2 °C/min and a mass ratio of stabilized pitch to carbon fibers of 1:1.
