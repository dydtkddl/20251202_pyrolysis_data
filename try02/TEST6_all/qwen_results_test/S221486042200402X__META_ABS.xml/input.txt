A review on additive manufacturing of refractory tungsten and tungsten alloys We review the progress of additive manufacturing effort on refractory metal tungsten and tungsten alloys. These materials are excellent candidates for a variety of high temperature applications but extremely challenging to fabricate via additive manufacturing due to a series of existing issues during the manufacturing. We outline these issues and discuss the current understanding and progress to tackle them. Laser powder-bed-fusion, laser directed-energy-deposition, and electron beam powder-bed-fusion are three common techniques that have been applied to additively manufacture pure tungsten. This overview discusses current observations and understanding on the issues associated with each of these techniques. We identify future research opportunities in additive manufacturing of refractory metals.
