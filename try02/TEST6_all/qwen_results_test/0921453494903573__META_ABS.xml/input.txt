Magnetic properties of superconducting Y-Pd-B-C The macroscopic magnetic properties of the superconducting phase in a multiphase YPd5B3C0.3 sample have been determined and analyzed. We have found that (1) the compound is an extreme Type-II superconductor with the upper critical field H c2 at 0 K, H c2(0)∽9 T and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ#62;10, (2) the H c2(T) and the irreversibility line H i(T) are very close, implying that thermal activation and thermal fluctuations of vortices both play a minor role in the flux dynamics of this compound, (3) the superconducting grains in the as-synthesized sample seem to be well connected despite the fact that the superconducting volume fraction is less than 50%.
