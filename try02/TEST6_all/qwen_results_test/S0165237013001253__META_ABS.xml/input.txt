Catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene: A comparison between pillared and restructured clays In this work, three restructured smectite clays, namely a saponite, a montmorillonite, and a beidellite, as well as their Al- and Fe/Al-pillared derivatives, have been tested for their performance in the catalytic cracking of a medium-density polyethylene. All reduce the cracking process temperature to 300°C, as compared with >650°C for uncatalysed pyrolysis. Although generally less active than a selected H-ZSM5 (Si/Al=235) zeolite, they are instead superior to this catalyst as regards liquid hydrocarbon formation. Different products categories can be obtained by different catalysts: in particular a choice between aliphatics and aromatics products can be made by utilising the appropriate catalysts.
