You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of common plastics and their mixtures to produce valuable petroleum-like products In the present study, polystyrene (PS), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and their mixture undergo intermediate isothermal pyrolysis at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C inside a tubular semi-continuous reactor under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The liquid pyrolytic oil samples recovered in each case were analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to identify and quantify the different products formed. It was found that polyethylenes (HDPE and LDPE) behave similarly in these pyrolysis conditions. For instance, GC analysis showed consecutive triplet series of linear aliphatic hydrocarbons at each carbon number of the alkane, 1-alkene, 1,(N-1)-alkadiene where N is the carbon number. On the other hand, PP, LDPE, and HDPE pyrolytic oil were rich in olefinic compounds. However, the case was quite different for PS. The pyrolytic oil was constituted totally of aromatic compounds ranging from mono to tri aromatic hydrocarbons. Styrene was the main product, along with other products such as styrene dimer, styrene trimer, benzene, toluene, bibenzyl, and α-methylstyrene. Results showed an increase in lighter hydrocarbons as the temperature increased, especially for styrene, where the weight fraction in the oil increased from 40 wt.% to 60 wt.%. Ultimately, a synergistic effect was observed with mixed plastic pyrolysis, yielding lighter compounds with a lower liquid quantity. In addition, the quality of the oil seems to be improved by the increase of around 10 wt.% of both aromatic and light compounds from the expected value at the expense of the heavier fraction. The computed lower heating value (LHV) for gaseous and liquid products ranged between 40 MJ/kg and 51 MJ/kg. A quick glance at the possible end use of each oil was investigated along with a principal component analysis (PCA) on the pyrolytic oil.
