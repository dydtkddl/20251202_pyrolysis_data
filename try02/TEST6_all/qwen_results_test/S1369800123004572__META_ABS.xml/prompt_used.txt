You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D-hexagonhelical TiO2-monoliths: Design, printing process and solar photoactivity Solid 3D titanium dioxide (TiO2) structures with hexagonhelical (3DHH) geometry were possible to achieve through additive printing technology. The monoliths acquired the shape and hydrodynamic requirements of a tubular solar CPC photoreactor. The optimum printing parameters were achieved with a 1.2 mm ∅ nozzle, and a dosing rate of 0.87 ml/min, with a duration of 10 min per complete manufactured piece. The heat treatment (Tam⇨180°C30 min ⇨250°C30 min ⇨350°C30 min) applied to the printed pieces does not modify the active anatase/rutile weight ratio (82.9/17.1). On the contrary, the mechanical resistance improved remarkably after the heat treatment: a compressive stress 5 folds higher (307.81 ± 15.31 kPa) was observed in comparison with the pieces without heat treatment. The most important shrinkage in diameter and height are generated throughout the dehumidification process at room temperature of free drying for 24 h (Δ∅ = 3.86 ± 0.43 mm and Δh = 3.78 ± 0.16 mm respectively). In contrast, the size changes were insignificant after heat treatment (Δ∅ = 0.075 ± 0.12 mm and Δh = 0.15 ± 0.01 mm). The microscopic morphology shows changes on the surface of the monoliths with deagglomerated flat shapes after heat treatment. Persistent degradation of the IBP model compound was observed over 10 cycles under solar irradiation in a laboratory-scale photoreactor using twelve heat-pretreated 3DHH-TiO2 monoliths. In addition, 10 cycles were compared for monoliths without thermal processing. Including both cases (monoliths with and without heat treatment), 90% of the solar experiments degraded between 50 and 95% of the initial IBP concentration per cycle (200 mg/L). The resistance to erosion acquired by heat treatment allows mechanical stability for photocatalytic purposes while maintaining significant solar activity. The commercial use of heterogeneous photocatalytic processes on an industrial scale could soon be achieved with the support of 3D additive manufacturing.
