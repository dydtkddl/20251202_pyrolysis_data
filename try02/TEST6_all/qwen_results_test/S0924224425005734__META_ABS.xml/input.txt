Electric field-based technologies for functional modification of food biopolymers: Recent advances and trends in proteins, dietary fibers and starches Background The development of novel food ingredients with tailored functional properties is a key strategy to meet consumer demands for healthier, sustainable products and to improve the technological performance of food formulations. Fibers, starches, and proteins are fundamental biopolymers that determine texture, stability, and sensory attributes, and their techno-properties can be significantly enhanced through structural modification. In recent years, electric field-based technologies have gained prominence as innovative tools to precisely modify these macromolecules, providing an efficient alternative to conventional chemical or thermal treatments. Scope and approach This review provides a critical discussion of recent trends (2020-2025) in the use of ohmic heating (OH), moderate electric fields (MEF), high-voltage electrical discharge (HVED), and pulsed electric fields (PEF) to modify the technological properties of proteins, dietary fibers, and starches for ingredient design. The mechanisms by which these technologies induce structural and conformational changes, the process parameters influencing the outcomes, and the impacts on hydration, solubility, emulsification, gelling, viscosity, retrogradation, and digestibility, among other functional properties are systematically discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on highlighting the advantages of these techniques in producing sustainable, high-performance ingredients through controllable, mild, and sustainable processes. Key findings and conclusions Electric field-based technologies are important tools in food ingredient engineering, enabling targeted modification of fiber hydration and water-holding capacity, starch gelatinization and retrogradation behavior, and protein solubility and emulsifying properties. PEF and HVED excel in non-thermal, structural disruption, OH and MEF promote uniform heating and conformational rearrangements, and all provide opportunities for designing novel ingredients with improved technological and nutritional attributes. As research advances, optimizing processing parameters and scaling up industrial applications will be crucial to fully harness their potential for the development of novel, sustainable food ingredients aligned with market and sustainability trends.
