You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Control of macromolecular architecture during the reactive functionalization in the melt of olefin polymers The functionalization of polyolefins is a useful methodology to chemically convert these extremely important commodities into value-added polymers by generating materials with additional properties, such as adhesion, dyeability, paintability, wettability, and compatibility that are not characteristic of the starting macromolecules with a paraffin structure. Owing to the intrinsic chemical resistance and low reactivity of polyolefins, the post-modification processes involve the use of free-radicals and are generally carried out at high temperature, rendering the reactions non-selective. Cross-linking and degradation set boundaries of the desired grafting reaction and their extent of grafting depends on the type of polyolefin and nature/type of chemicals used. The occurrence of these side reactions can severely damage the structure of polyolefins with poor control of ultimate properties. The main purpose here is to describe the conventional process in terms of chemical reactions involved, down to the molecular mechanism, and the dependence on chemicals/reagents nature and amounts. Particular attention is focused on methodologies aimed to hinder side reactions. The corresponding new functionalization approaches are based on well-known process chemistry and are all directed to control the grafting levels and structure/architecture of the initial polymer. Finally, a section is devoted to problems related to the radical post-modification processes of polypropylenes and obtaining new interesting materials by controlling their structure/architecture with the use of specific mono- or poly-functional co-agents as macroradical stabilizers.
