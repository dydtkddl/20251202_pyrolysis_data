You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plasma-assisted synthesis of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) characterized by online UV–Vis analysis An online UV–Vis analysis system is established to reveal the dynamic characteristics of plasma-assisted synthesis of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC). Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma is generated in a vibrated-bed reactor intermittently so that the decoupled processes, i.e., the plasma initiated chlorination step and the chlorine migration step, are mimicked and operated repeatedly at atmospheric pressure. The instant chlorine consumption rate shows corresponding cyclic curves, illustrating evident plasma initiation followed by chlorine migration inside particles. The mechanism of process decoupling concept is therefore demonstrated vividly. Under the same power density of plasma, temperature is ascertained as a key factor to influence the PVC chlorination process. PVC particles with smaller sizes tend to be chlorinated easily, while other particle properties such as specific surface area and microstructure also exert complicated effect on the chlorination process. SEM results show that plasma can destroy the film layer on the particle surface, which makes the secondary sub-particles inside a PVC particle expose to the environmental chlorination gas and plasma. A pyrolysis GC–MS analysis helps to identify the molecular structure of CPVC product in terms of the compositions of chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene in the pyrolized products, which are formed by chlorine atoms bonded on polymer chains.
