3D printed flow reactors for the synthesis of single crystal perovskites Defect-free single crystal perovskites have unique photophysical properties that makes them highly attractive for a range of optoelectronic applications. However, their syntheses largely rely on batch protocols, which are limited in terms of reproducibility and scalability. Here, a new methodology is presented to develop tailored continuous-flow platforms for the synthesis of lead halide perovskites. The digital design of the reactors and their manufacturing with 3D printing, employing commercially available resins and low-cost stereolithography, was achieved. The reactor chamber was designed to facilitate the continuous slow addition of reagents to the reaction chamber, thus maintaining a constant concentration of reagents inside the reactor. The highly controlled synthetic conditions allowed for a high reproducibility of the crystallization process, with yields ranging between 8 and 15% in weight in eight consecutive reaction cycles. The crystals produced were characterized and demonstrated excellent photoluminescence properties.
