Recycling of waste from polymer materials: An overview of the recent works Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental problems caused by polymeric waste accumulation generated from day-to-day applications of polymer materials such packaging and construction. The recycling of polymeric waste helps to conserve natural resource because the most of polymer materials are made from oil and gas. This paper reviews the recent progress on recycling of polymeric waste form some traditional polymers and their systems (blends and composites) such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), and introduces the mechanical and chemical recycling concepts. In addition, the effect of mechanical recycling on properties including the mechanical, thermal, rheological and processing properties of the recycled materials is highlighted in the present paper.
