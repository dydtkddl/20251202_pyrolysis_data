You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High stable NiCoAl catalyst prepared by combustion method for the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived phenolic compounds: Effect of calcination temperature The hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived phenolic compounds holds great promise for biomass-derived liquid fuel production. However, achieving a consistently high cyclohexane yield poses a formidable challenge. In this study, NiCoAl catalysts were successfully synthesized using the solution combustion method for the hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-oil. The impact of calcination temperature on the preparation of NiCoAl catalysts was investigated. The results indicate that the selectivity of cyclohexane exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as the calcination temperature rises. Notably, the NiCoAl-600 catalyst reached 99.99% guaiacol conversion, with the highest selectivity of cyclohexane (97.96%) achieved. Characterization results demonstrate that the transition of the spinel structure from normal to inverse with rising calcination temperature. Moreover, the catalyst particle size initially decreases and then increases, while the oxygen vacancy concentration in the catalyst increases. It was found that these properties contribute to a better hydrodeoxygenation performances of guaiacol and other phenolic compounds over non-noble NiCoAl catalyst. Possible reaction pathway and mechanism are proposed and discussed. Additionally, the spinel-structured NiCoAl-600 catalyst has good thermal stability, ensuring potential application in the upgrading of lignin-oil.
