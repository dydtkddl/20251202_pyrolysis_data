You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of the materials utilized in the design and fabrication of biogas digesters This work aims to discuss the different materials used in the construction and fabrication of biogas digesters, which are critical for sustainable energy generation. The study analyzes a broad spectrum of materials, including civil construction materials such as bricks, sand, stone, and concrete, thermoplastics like polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene, composite materials, and metallic substrates such as steel. These materials play a vital role in the structural integrity and functionality of biogas digesters, fulfilling various purposes depending on their properties. The main aim of this review is to consolidate and compare the properties inherent to each material, discuss the attributes of their designs, and outline their specific applications for the development of biogas digesters. The methodology involves a qualitative analysis of existing research, highlighting the techniques of adapting various materials that could accelerate the development of biogas technologies. Furthermore, the review examines the biogas production process within digesters made from materials such as stones, cement, thermoplastics, and ferrous alloys, which are also used for gas storage. Our findings indicate that small-scale, domestic biogas digesters predominantly use cement-based materials due to their rigidity, robustness, and long service life. In contrast, material selection for large-scale or commercial biogas plants is influenced by a complex relationship between the properties of the materials and the environmental factors, considering the distinct physical, electrical, and thermal characteristics of each material. Nevertheless, plastic-based digesters emerge as a promising alternative in regions facing logistical challenges, attributed to their chemical resistance, flexibility, and recyclability.
