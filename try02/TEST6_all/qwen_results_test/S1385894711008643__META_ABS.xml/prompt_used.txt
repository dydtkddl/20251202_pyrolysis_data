You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of time and temperature on pyrolysis of plastic wastes in a semi-batch reactor The objective of this work is the study of the influence of temperature and time in the products obtained in the pyrolysis of plastic wastes. The thermal behaviour of a mixture, which resembles municipal plastic wastes has been studied both in a thermogravimetric analyser and in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor at atmospheric pressure in order to establish the most appropriate time–temperature combination for plastic waste pyrolysis. It has been proved by the authors that temperature has a strong effect in the characteristics of pyrolysis liquids and to a lesser extent in gas and solid properties. At the lowest temperature tested (460°C), a great proportion of extremely viscous liquids with high content of long hydrocarbon chains are obtained, while at the highest temperature tested (600°C) low proportion of liquids with a high content of aromatics is produced. The effect of time is not as strong as that of temperature except for very short reaction times (0–15min). 15–30min was established as the optimum reaction time range, since total conversion is achieved and longer reaction times do not produce any effect neither in conversion nor in products characteristics. 500°C has been found to be the most appropriate temperature for the pyrolysis of such plastic waste in terms of both conversion and quality of the products.
