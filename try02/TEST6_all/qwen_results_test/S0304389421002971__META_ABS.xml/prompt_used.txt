You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Do FeCl3 and FeCl3/CaO conditioners change pyrolysis and incineration performances, emissions, and elemental fates of textile dyeing sludge? The pyrolysis and incineration performances of sulfur-rich textile dyeing sludge (TDSS) were determined in response to the additions of FeCl3 or FeCl3 + CaO. The emissions of eight air pollutants from the incineration and pyrolysis were systematically identified. The 3-to-8% FeCl3 additions increased the comprehensive combustibility index by 2.14 and 1.62 times, respectively, as opposed to the 5-to-10% FeCl3 + 8-to-15% CaO additions. The CaO addition inhibited the TDSS incineration, while the FeCl3 addition increased HCl emission. NO x , SO2, and H2S emissions decreased initially and increased between 600 and 950 °C. SO2 and NO x emissions rose with FeCl3 but FeCl3 + CaO. FeCl3 catalyzed NO x , while CaO retained SO2. The main pyrolysis gas/liquid products were alkane, alkenes, nitrile, heterocyclic compounds, benzene, and its derivatives. Benzene and its derivatives accounted for 55.33% of the control group and 42.25–57.23% of the treatment groups. The FeCl3 and FeCl3 + CaO additions did not significantly influence the pyrolysis products. The measured versus thermodynamically simulated SO x and HCl emissions were consistent. Neural network-based simultaneous optimizations of the non-linear dynamics of eight kinds of gases pointed to 50% and 14.4% reductions in the emissions and the pyrolytic temperature, respectively, with the 3% FeCl3, relative to the control.
