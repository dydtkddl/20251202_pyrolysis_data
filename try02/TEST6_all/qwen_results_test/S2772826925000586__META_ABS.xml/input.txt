Synergistic effect of Fe-promoted catalyst and low-rank coal absorber in microwave-assisted plastic pyrolysis The escalating accumulation of plastic waste has become a pressing environmental crisis, requiring innovative valorization strategies. This study investigated a microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) system employing low-rank coal (LRC) as a microwave absorber, HZSM-5 as an acidic catalytic matrix, and iron (Fe) as a redox promoter to convert polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE) into high-quality liquid fuels. Proximate analysis confirmed the high volatility of the plastics and the dual role of LRC as both a microwave susceptor and carbon co-reactant. Systematic variation of microwave power (300–800 W) and residence time (30–180 min) revealed that higher powers enhanced oil yield, with reactivity following the order PS > PP > PE. The Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst delivered the most significant improvements, reducing density and viscosity while increasing °API gravity (>35) and calorific value (>50 MJ/kg), thereby meeting or surpassing conventional light fuel specifications. GC–MS and FTIR analyses confirmed distinct product distributions: PS-derived oils rich in aromatics, PE dominated by linear alkanes/olefins, and PP producing mixed hydrocarbons, with very low oxygenated species. The synergistic interplay of LRC for rapid heating, HZSM-5 for catalytic cracking, and Fe for dehydrogenation/aromatization enabled the selective production of light hydrocarbons. Collectively, the findings establish the Fe/LRC/HZSM-5 system as a technically viable and energy-efficient platform for valorizing segregated plastic waste streams into petroleum-like fuels. While the present study focused on single-polymer feedstocks, future work will extend to binary and ternary blends under microwave heating, explore continuous-flow reactor integration, and assess techno-economic feasibility at larger scales, advancing both waste management and renewable energy agendas.
