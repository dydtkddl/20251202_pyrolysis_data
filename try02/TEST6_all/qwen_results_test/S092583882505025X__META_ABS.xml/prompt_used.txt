You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hierarchical microstructure engineering of MOF-derived Co/N-doped carbon composites for tailored impedance matching and enhanced microwave absorption The increasing demand for lightweight and efficient microwave absorbers has underscored the importance of simultaneously optimizing electromagnetic attenuation and impedance matching. Although MOF-derived carbon nanocomposites offer tunable conductivity and versatile microstructures, prior research has largely focused on single-structure modifications, overlooking the broader impact of microstructural configuration. In this study, we systematically engineered four distinct structural configurations, including solid, hollow, porous, and hollow-porous, within a unified ZIF-67-derived Co/N-doped carbon system. Comparative analysis reveals that hierarchical structure modulation plays a decisive role in balancing impedance matching and attenuation mechanisms. Specifically, the hollow-porous composite (HM-CoNC) achieves synergistic enhancement through multi-interface polarization, scattering, and conductive/magnetic losses, enabled by the integration of mesopores, internal cavities, and uniformly dispersed Co nanoparticles. As a result, HM-CoNC exhibits a minimum reflection loss of −69.52 dB at 1.62 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth of 5.25 GHz at 1.69 mm, outperforming its structural counterparts. Radar cross-section simulations further validate its stealth potential with a 29.87 dB·m2 reduction relative to the uncoated substrate. These findings provide valuable insight into the microstructure-performance relationship and highlight hierarchical engineering as an effective strategy for designing high-performance microwave absorbing materials.
