You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of municipal solid waste air gasification for higher H2 production along with the validation via kinetics and statistical approaches This study aimed to investigate municipal solid waste (MSW) gasification to produce hydrogen (H2) at optimum levels. Therefore, the gasification of MSW was initially investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometer (MS). The leading gases detected by the MS included; H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. Afterward, the gasification was carried out in the tubular batch reactor to investigate the composition, gasification products, and syngas properties (H2/CO molar ratio, H2 + CO, lower heating value (LHV), H2 yield)) under some influencing parameters. Due to the dominating reaction temperature, a significant increase in H2 (25.41% to 39.70%) and gas (57.10–74.93%) production accompanied a notable decrease in tar (16.48–8.54%) and char (28.40–15.52 wt%) contents. Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and central composite design (CCD) models were applied to investigate kinetic and statistical parameters which showed better results. Optimum H2 production of 45.79 mol% with H2/CO, H2 + CO, LHV, and yield of 1.78, 72.78 mol%, 9.96 MJ/Nm3, and 13.83 mol kg-MSW−1 respectively was obtained at optimal temperature, particle size, and heating rate of 703.49 ℃, 3.21 mm, and 5 ℃/min respectively, which can be an appropriate fuel for Fischer Tropsch process for manufacturing of transportation fuels.
