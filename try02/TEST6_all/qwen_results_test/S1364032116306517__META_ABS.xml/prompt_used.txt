You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Models for the combustion of single solid fuel particles in fluidized beds: A review Combustion is a key process of energy utilization in fluidized beds. To achieve higher efficiency and lower pollution, a fundamental understanding of the complex combustion behavior is required. Mathematical modeling plays important roles in the exploration of the complex process and the prediction of combustion performance. Up to now, many models of the combustion of solid fuel particles have been presented. This study gives a detailed review of the proposed combustion models for common solid fuels, i.e., coal, biomass, and solid waste. The combustion models for coal and biomass have matured. However, models for solid waste have seldom been studied and need to be studied further. Considering the complex compositions of biomass and solid waste, a systematic model library based on many works should be proposed for them in the future. In addition, the transformation behavior of hazardous substance (F, Cl, and heavy metals) in solid waste should also be considered in combustion models in the future. Moreover, advanced measuring methods, such as laser measurements, should be used in future works to better understand the reaction mechanism during combustion and improve the accuracies of the models. An overall and accurate model library for the combustion of various type of solid fuels is expected to be established in the future, which will be helpful in the design, adjustment, and operation of combustion systems.
