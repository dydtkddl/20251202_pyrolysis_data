Models for the combustion of single solid fuel particles in fluidized beds: A review Combustion is a key process of energy utilization in fluidized beds. To achieve higher efficiency and lower pollution, a fundamental understanding of the complex combustion behavior is required. Mathematical modeling plays important roles in the exploration of the complex process and the prediction of combustion performance. Up to now, many models of the combustion of solid fuel particles have been presented. This study gives a detailed review of the proposed combustion models for common solid fuels, i.e., coal, biomass, and solid waste. The combustion models for coal and biomass have matured. However, models for solid waste have seldom been studied and need to be studied further. Considering the complex compositions of biomass and solid waste, a systematic model library based on many works should be proposed for them in the future. In addition, the transformation behavior of hazardous substance (F, Cl, and heavy metals) in solid waste should also be considered in combustion models in the future. Moreover, advanced measuring methods, such as laser measurements, should be used in future works to better understand the reaction mechanism during combustion and improve the accuracies of the models. An overall and accurate model library for the combustion of various type of solid fuels is expected to be established in the future, which will be helpful in the design, adjustment, and operation of combustion systems.
