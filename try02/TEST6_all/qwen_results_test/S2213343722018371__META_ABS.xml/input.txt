A study on the co-combustion of excavated waste and municipal solid waste: Thermogravimetric characteristics and gaseous pollutants emission To investigate the co-combustion behavior, a thermogravimetric analyzer combined with Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) analysis was conducted on the blending samples of excavated waste (EW) and municipal solid waste (MSW) at different ratios. In addition, the co-combustion experiment at 700, 800, and 900 °C was carried out on a fixed bed reactor to determine the typical gaseous pollutants emission. The degree of interaction is evaluated by the weight loss deviation rate of co-combustion and individual combustion. The greater the deviation rate indicates the more significant interaction effect. The results showed that there were significant interactions between MSW and EW during the co-combustion process. Co-combustion with MSW improved the ignition, burnout and comprehensive combustion performance of EW samples, and the improvement of the co-combustion performance of EW which was landfilled in 2005 (05-EW) was more obvious than that landfilled in 2015 (15-EW). The blending ratio of MSW below 40% can avoid the obvious incremental effect on the generation of HCl, SO2 and NOx, and the above gaseous pollutants were significantly suppressed at 700–800 ℃. Furthermore, co-combustion of 15-EW with MSW was more likely to exhibit inhibitory effects on gaseous pollutant emission. Based on the results of thermogravimetric analysis and pollutant emission experiment, the low MSW blending ratio (below 40%) and low combustion temperature (between 700 and 800 °C) could improve the combustion conditions of EW and suppress the emission of gaseous pollutants.
