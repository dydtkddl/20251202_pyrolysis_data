You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PMMA-grafted silica aerogel nanoparticles via in situ SR&NI ATRP: Grafting through approach An organic modifier with vinyl moiety, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (MPS), was employed to surface modification of hydrophilic silica aerogel nanoparticles. After that, double bond moieties on the surface were incorporated in grafting through polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) via in situ simultaneous reverse and normal initiation technique for atom transfer radical polymerization (SR&NI ATRP). Grafting through polymerization of MMA results in tailor-made poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with twofold chains. Successful surface modification of hydrophilic silica aerogel nanoparticles with MPS is demonstrated by Furrier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm is applied to examine surface area and structural characteristics of the synthesized silica aerogel nanoparticles. Evaluation of size distribution and morphological studies were performed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Conversion and molecular weight determinations were carried out using gas and size exclusion chromatography respectively. Addition of MPS-functionalized silica aerogel nanoparticles by 3 wt% results in decrement of conversion from 87 to 66%. By adding 3 wt% MPS-functionalized silica aerogel nanoparticles, molecular weight (Mn) of free MMA chains decreases from 13,563 to 9365; however, polydispersity index (PDI) value increases from 1.19 to 1.56. Although PDI values of attached MMA chains are increased from 1.48 to 2.08, Mn values reveal an increment by adding MPS-functionalized silica aerogel nanoparticles content. Low PDI values of the products can appropriately demonstrate the living nature of polymerization. An increment of thermal stability of the nanocomposites by increasing MPS-functionalized silica aerogel nanoparticles is demonstrated by TGA results. Differential scanning calorimetry also shows a decrement in glass transition temperature by increasing MPS-functionalized silica aerogel nanoparticles loading.
