You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modulating reactive oxygen species in O, S co-doped C3N4 to enhance photocatalytic degradation of microplastics Photocatalytic microplastic (MP) degradation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a considered environmentally friendly and sustainable approach for eliminating MP pollution in aquatic environments. However, it faces challenges due to the low migration and rapid recombination efficiency of charge carriers in photocatalysts. Herein, oxygen and sulfur co-doped carbon nitride (OSCN) nanosheets were synthesized through thermal polymerization coupled with a thermosolvent process. The O and S co-doping can reduce the bandgap and improve the light response of carbon nitride (C3N4). Meanwhile, O/S dopants effectively improve the delocalization of electron distribution, leading to increased carrier separation capacity, thereby promoting the formation of ROS and enhancing photocatalytic performance. Compared to C3N4, OSCN demonstrated significantly higher photocatalytic degradation and mineralization rates for MPs, including polyethylene (PE, traditional petroleum-based MPs) and polylactic acid (PLA, biodegradable bio-based MPs). Specifically, the mass loss of PE and PLA increased by 32.8 ​% and 34.1 ​%, respectively. Notably, •OH and 1O2 generated by OSCN synergistically catalyzed the degradation of PE, while •OH was the primary radical triggering the photolysis and hydrolysis of PLA. This study holds significant implications for the application of photocatalysis technology in the remediation of MP pollution in aquatic environments.
