Study on the co-pyrolysis of waste tires and plastics Polymer waste has attracted worldwide attention recently due to its potential environmental risks if not disposed of properly. In this study, waste tires (WTs) and three typical kinds of waste plastics (WPs, PVC, PP, and PE) were selected to investigate the characteristics and products distribution of the co-pyrolysis process via TG-FTIR/MS. DTG curves of WTs and WPs mixture show more than one stage. In accordance with the difference in comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) and activation energy, synergy effect exists during the co-pyrolysis process of WT and WP. Among these mixture systems, WTs & PE and WPs & PVC mixture present the highest and lowest CPI values, respectively. Similarly, WTs & PVC (46.75 kJ mol−1) and WTs & PE (318.37 kJ mol−1) exhibit the minimum and maximum activation energies, respectively. Furthermore, the co-pyrolysis mechanism of WTs and WPs through the Malek method was also explored, in which both individual components and mixture followed the principle model of one-dimensional diffusion. In addition, the distribution of products has been analyzed with FTIR and MS. Consequently, the present study will give insight into the co-processing of WTs and WPs, so as to provide basic knowledge for the pyrolysis of polymer waste.
