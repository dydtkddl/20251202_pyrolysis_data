You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the co-pyrolysis of waste tires and plastics Polymer waste has attracted worldwide attention recently due to its potential environmental risks if not disposed of properly. In this study, waste tires (WTs) and three typical kinds of waste plastics (WPs, PVC, PP, and PE) were selected to investigate the characteristics and products distribution of the co-pyrolysis process via TG-FTIR/MS. DTG curves of WTs and WPs mixture show more than one stage. In accordance with the difference in comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) and activation energy, synergy effect exists during the co-pyrolysis process of WT and WP. Among these mixture systems, WTs & PE and WPs & PVC mixture present the highest and lowest CPI values, respectively. Similarly, WTs & PVC (46.75 kJ mol−1) and WTs & PE (318.37 kJ mol−1) exhibit the minimum and maximum activation energies, respectively. Furthermore, the co-pyrolysis mechanism of WTs and WPs through the Malek method was also explored, in which both individual components and mixture followed the principle model of one-dimensional diffusion. In addition, the distribution of products has been analyzed with FTIR and MS. Consequently, the present study will give insight into the co-processing of WTs and WPs, so as to provide basic knowledge for the pyrolysis of polymer waste.
