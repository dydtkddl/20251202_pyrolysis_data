You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of cohesive meat and bone meal in a bubbling fluidized bed with an intermittent solid slug feeder Meat and bone meal (MBM) is a mass-produced by-product of the meat rendering industry. It has great potential as a feedstock for the production of bio-fuels. Meat and bone meal, however, is a highly cohesive and temperature sensitive material and has traditionally been found to be very difficult, if not impossible, to feed properly into pyrolysis reactors or bubbling fluidized beds. This study showcases an application of the ICFAR intermittent solid slug feeder technology and its capability of successfully feeding the MBM regularly at an average feeding rate of 0.34g/s into the reactor. A highly automated and instrumented fast pyrolysis pilot plant has been used to process meat and bone meal residues and to operate within a wide range of temperatures (450–600°C). This is the first study dealing with the pyrolysis of pure meat and bone meal at various operating conditions continuously fed into a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor. All liquid and solid products have been analyzed (yields, HHV, GC–MS, elemental analysis, and ash mineral analysis). The homogenous bio-oil produced is an attractive fuel with a significant high heating value (HHV) of 31.5MJ/kg and an average liquid yield of 43wt% at 550°C. The highest water-free HHV (36.7MJ/kg) was found at 500°C, with a liquid yield of 35wt% at this temperature. The optimized pyrolysis temperature, at which the heat from the gas combustion can provide the heat required for processing MBM, while maximizing the bio-oil liquid yield and process energy yield, is 550°C. Under these conditions, the pyrolysis process energy yield is 91%. The study also demonstrates a new technique to accurately determine the heat of pyrolysis reaction energy required by the process, using a non-invasive water calibration method.
