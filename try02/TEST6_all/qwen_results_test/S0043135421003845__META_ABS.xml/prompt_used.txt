You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrochar derived from municipal sludge through hydrothermal processing: A critical review on its formation, characterization, and valorization Additional options for the sustainable treatment of municipal sludge are required due to the significant amounts of sludge, high levels of nutrients (e.g., C, N, and P), and trace constituents it contains. Hydrothermal processing of municipal sludge has recently been recognized as a promising technology to efficiently reduce waste volume, recover bioenergy, destroy organic contaminants, and eliminate pathogens. However, a considerable amount of solid residue, called hydrochar, could remain after hydrothermal treatment. This hydrochar can contain abundant amounts of energy (with a higher heating value up to 24 MJ/kg, dry basis), nutrients, and trace elements, as well as surface functional groups. The valorization of sludge-derived hydrochar can facilitate the development and application of hydrothermal technologies. This review summarizes the formation pathways from municipal sludge to hydrochar, specifically, the impact of hydrothermal conditions on reaction mechanisms and product distribution. Moreover, this study comprehensively encapsulates the described characteristics of hydrochar produced under a wide range of conditions: Yield, energy density, physicochemical properties, elemental distribution, contaminants of concern, surface functionality, and morphology. More importantly, this review compares and evaluates the current state of applications of hydrochar: Energy production, agricultural application, adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, and nutrient recovery. Ultimately, along with the identified challenges and prospects of valorization approaches for sludge-derived hydrochar, conceptual designs of sustainable municipal sludge management are proposed.
