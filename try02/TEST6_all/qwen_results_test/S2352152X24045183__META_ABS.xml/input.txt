Investigation of chemical kinetic models for electrolyte solvent vapors released from thermal runaway lithium-ion batteries The vent gas generated from electrolyte decomposition during thermal runaway is the primary cause of fires in lithium-ion batteries. Accurate chemical kinetic models contribute to a deeper understanding of the rapid redox and reaction kinetics during the thermal runaway process in lithium-ion batteries, laying the foundation for the design of safer storage batteries. This study conducted combustion experiments on ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) and optimized a comprehensive chemical kinetic model for linear carbonate esters (LCEs). The laminar burning velocity (LBV) of EMC/air was measured via a 36-l constant volume combustion chamber at an initial temperature of 373 ± 2 K, initial pressure of 0.7–1.6 atm, and equivalence ratio of 0.6–1.6. Here, we present a novel method to optimize chemical kinetic models of LCEs. The method accurately screens the candidate reactions in the seed kinetic model through global sensitivity analysis and perturbation testing. The genetic algorithm was subsequently used to optimize the rates of candidate reactions in the new kinetic model within a small range (0.2–5 times the original values). The optimized model (Modelopt) enhanced the predictive accuracy of LBV and IDT by 28.4 % and 43.1 %, respectively, and reduced the prediction errors for EMC and DMC pyrolysis while retaining the prediction accuracy of DEC pyrolysis. Finally, experimental data outside of the optimization procedure were used to further validate the applicability of Modelopt.
