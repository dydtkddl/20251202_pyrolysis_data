You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of municipal sewage sludge and microalgae Chlorella Vulgaris: Products’ optimization; thermo-kinetic study, and ANN modeling Co-pyrolysis of microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (MCV) and municipal sewage sludge (MSS) was performed in a fixed-bed reactor to explore the influence of temperature (400–600 °C), mixing ratio (MCV/MSS = 0–1), and Argon flow rate of 0.20 to 0.80 L/min on pyrolysis products. The process was optimized using RSM to maximize bio-oil (BIO), minimize biochar (BIC), and biogas (BIG) yields. According to the ANOVA results, the mixing ratio has the most remarkable impact on BIO yield, and temperature has the highest influence on both BIC and BIG efficiency. By using numerical optimization, the optimum values of reaction parameters were T = 520 °C, mixing ratio (MCV/MSS) = 0.82, and Argon flow rate of 0.55 L/min. The third, second, and third-order of chemical reaction models can fit the pure MSS, MCV, and mix pyrolysis utilizing the Coats-Redfern technique, respectively. Also, master plots approaches were used to identify dominant reaction mechanisms. The values of the Eα calculated from non-model fitting methods for MSS, MCV, and co-pyrolysis are obtained in the domain of 79.19–125.59, 182.41–194.73, and 149.55–216.61 kJ/mol, in that order. The presence of the synergetic and inhibitive influences generated by the co-pyrolysis of MSS and MCV has been demonstrated by the improved and reduced weight loss rate, respectively. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) models with the architectures (3*8*3) and (2*8*1) were built to simulate and predict pyrolysis yields and the thermal decomposition of individual and co-pyrolysis process, demonstrated a strong agreement between the actual data and predicted data (R2 ⩾ 0.999) are considerably closer to 1.
