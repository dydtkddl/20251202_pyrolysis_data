You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantitatively tracing microplastics in sewage sludge using thermodesorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry combined with pyrolysis Sewage sludge is a major source of environmental microplastics. To address this issue, a reliable mass-based methodology was developed for the identification and quantification of five frequently detected microplastics in sewage sludge—polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)—using pyrolysis combined with thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-TD-GC/MS). The method achieved detection limits ranging from 0.14 μg to 3.70 μg and was utilized to assess microplastics removal during wastewater and sludge treatment processes, covering sizes from 0.22 μm to 5.00 mm. Total microplastics concentrations decreased from 8714.59 ± 228.48 μg/g dry weight (dw) in primary sedimentation sludge to 3828.41 ± 557.92 μg/g dw in secondary sedimentation sludge, with PE, PET, and PVC as the dominant polymers. Size- and polymer-dependent deposition patterns were noted during wastewater treatment. Further treatments—including centrifugal dewatering, thermal hydrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and compression dewatering—reduced microplastics concentrations from 6033.18 ± 77.94 μg/g dw in raw sludge to 470.82 ± 48.08 μg/g dw in final sludge. Centrifugal dewatering significantly removed microplastics while thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion had minimal effects. This study establishes a robust methodology for quantifying microplastics in sludge and insights into their removal processes, aiding source prevention for microplastics contamination.
