You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study of the co-hydrocracking mechanism of polyolefin plastics and atmospheric residue The recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is a significant challenge owing to its inherent resource attribute and the resulting environmental issues. Slurry-phase hydrocracking technology, which employs a dispersed catalyst with high dispersion and catalytic activities, is a promising technology to process mixed feedstocks of inferior heavy oils and plastic powders. Herein, the slurry-phase co-hydrocracking of polyolefin plastics and atmospheric residue (AR) using a dispersed Mo-based catalyst is investigated in detail. Experimental results indicate that the cracking of polyolefin plastics generates free radicals, leading to the formation of gas and naphtha, as well as condensing with residue macromolecular free radicals to produce AR and coke products. Therefore, the distribution and composition of the co-hydrocracking products are influenced by the addition of polyolefin plastics, particularly highly reactive polypropylene (PP). Furthermore, the saturate, aromatic, resin, and C7-asphaltene (SARA) of the co-hydrocracking AR products are separated and systematically analyzed to investigate the synergistic reaction mechanism of polyolefin plastics and heavy oil at the molecular level. For the heavy products, the results show that the polyolefin-derived small molecule hydrocarbon free radicals will combine with the hydrocarbon free radicals generated by heavy oil, thereby leading to an increase in both the side chain number and branching degree of the AR product.
