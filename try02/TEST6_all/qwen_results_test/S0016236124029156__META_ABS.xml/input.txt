Experimental study of the co-hydrocracking mechanism of polyolefin plastics and atmospheric residue The recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is a significant challenge owing to its inherent resource attribute and the resulting environmental issues. Slurry-phase hydrocracking technology, which employs a dispersed catalyst with high dispersion and catalytic activities, is a promising technology to process mixed feedstocks of inferior heavy oils and plastic powders. Herein, the slurry-phase co-hydrocracking of polyolefin plastics and atmospheric residue (AR) using a dispersed Mo-based catalyst is investigated in detail. Experimental results indicate that the cracking of polyolefin plastics generates free radicals, leading to the formation of gas and naphtha, as well as condensing with residue macromolecular free radicals to produce AR and coke products. Therefore, the distribution and composition of the co-hydrocracking products are influenced by the addition of polyolefin plastics, particularly highly reactive polypropylene (PP). Furthermore, the saturate, aromatic, resin, and C7-asphaltene (SARA) of the co-hydrocracking AR products are separated and systematically analyzed to investigate the synergistic reaction mechanism of polyolefin plastics and heavy oil at the molecular level. For the heavy products, the results show that the polyolefin-derived small molecule hydrocarbon free radicals will combine with the hydrocarbon free radicals generated by heavy oil, thereby leading to an increase in both the side chain number and branching degree of the AR product.
