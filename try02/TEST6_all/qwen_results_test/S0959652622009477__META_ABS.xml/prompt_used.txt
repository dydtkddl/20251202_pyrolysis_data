You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbonaceous materials as effective adsorbents and catalysts for the removal of emerging contaminants from water The elimination of emerging contaminants (ECs) from aquatic environment has become a worldwide concern due to their widespread occurrence and consequent detrimental effects on living organisms. This review aims to highlight the applicability of carbonaceous materials including activated carbon, biochar, carbon nanofibers, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon aerogel for ECs removal. This review depicts the versatility of carbonaceous material as an adsorbent, as a catalyst and as a catalyst support for ECs removal. The mechanistic aspects involved in the adsorptive removal of ECs through π-π interactions, electrostatic interaction, n-π interactions, H-bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and pore filling were emphasized. An in-depth discussion on the catalytic properties of carbonaceous materials to activate peroxydisulfate (PS), peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and hydrogen peroxide leading to ECs degradation via radical and non-radical pathways were provided. The significance of carbonaceous materials when employed as catalyst support in photocatalysis, heterogeneous Fenton and catalytic ozonation was exemplified.
