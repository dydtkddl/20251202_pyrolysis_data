Recovery of aluminum from plastic packages containing aluminum by gasification The standing pouch, a packaging material made of multiple layers of plastic and metal, presents a significant challenge for full recycling. Gasification shows promise as a method to recover aluminum from this type of waste and convert it into energy. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of gasification in treating aluminum-containing plastic packages, and recovering aluminum while identifying the optimal combinations of temperature and equivalence ratio (ER) to achieve the best outcomes. The study achieved a conversion rate of 43.06 wt% to 69.42 wt% of the original waste mass into syngas, with aluminum recovery rates ranging from 35.2 % to 65.3 %. Temperature and ER alterations affected the product distribution, aluminum recovery rate, and aluminum partitioning in the products. The results indicated that the combination of 700 °C, ER = 0.4 would provide the largest amount of syngas about 69.42 %, which is the main product of the gasification process, and therefore, this combination is the most optimal for syngas-yielding purposes. Under the reclaiming aluminum is more prioritized, the combination of 800 °C, ER = 0.6 would be the most optimal condition, the majority of Al in fuel was found in char and fly ash were 67.5 % and 4.81 %, respectively. The study focused on the partitioning of aluminum during the gasification process, which was observed to mainly exist in the form of Al2O3(s), with gaseous species including AlCl3(g), AlH(g), and Al2O(g) due to their medium volatility. As the ER increased, the amount of O2 also increased, leading to more Al2O3(s) formation. In conclusion, this research provides a foundation for further exploration of gasification as a means of energy conversion and metal recovery.
