You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of aluminum from plastic packages containing aluminum by gasification The standing pouch, a packaging material made of multiple layers of plastic and metal, presents a significant challenge for full recycling. Gasification shows promise as a method to recover aluminum from this type of waste and convert it into energy. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of gasification in treating aluminum-containing plastic packages, and recovering aluminum while identifying the optimal combinations of temperature and equivalence ratio (ER) to achieve the best outcomes. The study achieved a conversion rate of 43.06 wt% to 69.42 wt% of the original waste mass into syngas, with aluminum recovery rates ranging from 35.2 % to 65.3 %. Temperature and ER alterations affected the product distribution, aluminum recovery rate, and aluminum partitioning in the products. The results indicated that the combination of 700 °C, ER = 0.4 would provide the largest amount of syngas about 69.42 %, which is the main product of the gasification process, and therefore, this combination is the most optimal for syngas-yielding purposes. Under the reclaiming aluminum is more prioritized, the combination of 800 °C, ER = 0.6 would be the most optimal condition, the majority of Al in fuel was found in char and fly ash were 67.5 % and 4.81 %, respectively. The study focused on the partitioning of aluminum during the gasification process, which was observed to mainly exist in the form of Al2O3(s), with gaseous species including AlCl3(g), AlH(g), and Al2O(g) due to their medium volatility. As the ER increased, the amount of O2 also increased, leading to more Al2O3(s) formation. In conclusion, this research provides a foundation for further exploration of gasification as a means of energy conversion and metal recovery.
