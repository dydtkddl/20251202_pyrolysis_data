You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen-rich gas production from hydrochar derived from hydrothermal carbonization of PVC and alkali coal This work targets to produce hydrogen-rich syngas by steam gasification of hydrochars obtained from co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and alkali coal. Hydrochar properties were assessed in terms of ultimate analysis, proximate analysis and the content of typical elements. The syngas, tar and char properties were investigated to explore the steam gasification performace of hydrochars. The co-HTC facilitated the destruction of the hydrophilic groups based on the O/C atomic ratio. The co-HTC increased the yield of H2 and CH4, while the CO2 yield was concurrently reduced. A relative high H2/CO ratio of around 1.65–3.96 was achieved when gasified hydrochar under the various temperature. This temperature was supposed to be an acceptable operational window for yielding H2-rich syngas. The catalytic effect of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) on H2 production was weakened due to the AEEMs removal during the co-HTC, while the H2 production could be remedied by the PVC addition. The evolution of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) convinced the event of primary or secondary tars transformed into the tertiary tar. The rich pore structure of char indicated that char have good potential in adsorption, and the adsorption experiment of malachite green confirmed this point of view.These findings will offer comprehensive data on the coal upgrading and hydrochar gasification.
