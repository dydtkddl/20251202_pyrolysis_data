You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metallised seaweed-derived bio-char catalyst preparation and its application in the pyrolysis process for the waste fishing nets and marine biomass utilisation Marine biomass and plastic wastes are one of the most significant ecological issues of water pools, which could be adapted for energy recovery through pyrolysis. Moreover, a catalytical process could be applied to improve the quality and adaptability of the formed product. This study investigates seaweed (SWD) and fishing nets (FN) standalone pyrolysis with and without commercial ZSM-5 catalysts. Therefore, the newly created seaweed char-based metals (iron and copper) impregnated catalysts were investigated using SEM-EDS, XRD, and pore size distribution examination and applied for the selected feedstock pyrolysis process. The study revealed that bio-char contains 335 m2/g of surface area, while the impregnation process increased it to 1066 and 790 m2/g with copper and iron, respectively. Pyrolysis products investigation showed that the main derivatives of the FN liquid fraction are caprolactam and hexanenitrile, while the SWD liquids mainly consist of variously substituted aromatic and phenolic compounds. Copper-impregnated catalyst increased the amount of caprolactam to 54.3 % and hexanenitrile to 31.7 % (FN), while the amount of toluene was increased to 84.2 % (SWD) in the total liquid fraction. This research provides information regarding the promising route of newly created biochar preparation and application as a catalyst for the pyrolysis product upgrading.
