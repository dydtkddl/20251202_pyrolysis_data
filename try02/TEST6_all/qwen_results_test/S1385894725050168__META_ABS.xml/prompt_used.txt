You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ni-Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for syngas production in pyrolysis-dry reforming of plastics - the effect of amine nature on catalyst performance Pyrolysis combined with dry reforming (PCDR) is eco-friendly technology for plastic waste management, allowing for sustainable production of syngas. Design of suitable catalysts with high performance and stability is crucial for its industrialization. In this work, Ni-Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized using organic–inorganic precursors. Three types of amines (hexylamine – aliphatic linear, cyclohexylamine – aliphatic cyclic, aniline – aromatic) were used as carbon source in the precursor preparation to investigate their effect on catalyst physicochemical properties and its catalytic performance. Catalytic performance of the obtained catalysts was examined in PCDR of model waste plastic mixture. It was revealed that catalytic activity of catalysts prepared with aliphatic amines was higher compared to aromatic aniline, amine commonly used for carbide synthesis. The differences in catalyst properties, which affected their catalytic activity were characterized using N2-adsorption at −196 °C, XRD, H2-TPR, SEM, TG/DTG and CO2-adsorption methods. A correlation was observed between amine molecule complexity and Mo2C crystallite size, significantly affecting hydrogen generation. The less complex the amine, the smaller the crystallite and the increased hydrogen production. Moreover, the use of aliphatic amines resulted in the stronger Ni-support interactions, the increased number of more favorable, larger mesopores as well as the presence of the metallic Mo phase and the lack of unbound carbon in contrast to the catalyst obtained using aniline. The catalyst synthesized using hexylamine increased H2 yield by more than tenfold, syngas yield by more than threefold, and the H2/CO ratio by fivefold, which offers an opportunity for future industrialization of PCDR.
