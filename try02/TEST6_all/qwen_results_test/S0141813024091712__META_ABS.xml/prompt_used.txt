You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Facile preparation of solid gelatin foams by a water-lean batch foaming process Existing polystyrenic and polyolefinic packaging foams are non-biodegradable, and persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Gelatin foams are an interesting alternative, given their biodegradability, biocompatibility, solution-based processability, low cost, and non-toxicity. However, current methods for preparing gelatin foams, such as freeze-drying, microfluidic foaming, and batch foaming, are not suitable for high-volume production. In this context, we report the preparation of solid gelatin foams by a water-lean batch foaming process that involves simply mixing bloomed gelatin with a blowing agent, selected from inorganic bicarbonates and cyclic organic carbonates, and heating the resulting mixture in an open mold. The foaming was primarily attributed to CO2 produced by blowing agents, while the transformation from discrete gelatin granules to a continuous foam was facilitated by the melting, flowing, and fusion of the bloomed gelatin granules into a homogeneous mass upon heating. This process is simple, inexpensive, sustainable, and versatile, making it highly suitable for high-volume production of biodegradable foams, particularly for use in loose-fill packaging applications.
