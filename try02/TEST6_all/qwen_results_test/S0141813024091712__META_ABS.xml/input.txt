Facile preparation of solid gelatin foams by a water-lean batch foaming process Existing polystyrenic and polyolefinic packaging foams are non-biodegradable, and persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Gelatin foams are an interesting alternative, given their biodegradability, biocompatibility, solution-based processability, low cost, and non-toxicity. However, current methods for preparing gelatin foams, such as freeze-drying, microfluidic foaming, and batch foaming, are not suitable for high-volume production. In this context, we report the preparation of solid gelatin foams by a water-lean batch foaming process that involves simply mixing bloomed gelatin with a blowing agent, selected from inorganic bicarbonates and cyclic organic carbonates, and heating the resulting mixture in an open mold. The foaming was primarily attributed to CO2 produced by blowing agents, while the transformation from discrete gelatin granules to a continuous foam was facilitated by the melting, flowing, and fusion of the bloomed gelatin granules into a homogeneous mass upon heating. This process is simple, inexpensive, sustainable, and versatile, making it highly suitable for high-volume production of biodegradable foams, particularly for use in loose-fill packaging applications.
