You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted depolymerization of PET over heterogeneous catalysts The accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is rising and poses a significant environmental and health threat. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), used mainly in single-use plastic bottles, accounts for a substantial fraction of this waste. The currently employed recycling strategies are inadequate to deal with the global plastic waste problem. PET glycolysis is a promising depolymerization method but has mainly been conducted using homogeneous catalysts; developing active and sustainable catalysts, and more energy-efficient processes remain challenges. Here, we implement microwave heating in PET glycolysis and identify ZnO as an excellent heterogeneous catalyst. We demonstrate the influence of ZnO's particle size and facet and hydrogen bonding on its activity. Finally, we demonstrate excellent performance for real-world post-consumer PET waste deconstruction with rapid depolymerization into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving > 95% yields in less than 10 min. Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment also indicates that BHET produced by ZnO-catalyzed glycolysis has lower global warming potential than the petrochemical-based production and homogeneously-catalyzed glycolysis.
