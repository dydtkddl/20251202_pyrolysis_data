Microwave-assisted depolymerization of PET over heterogeneous catalysts The accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is rising and poses a significant environmental and health threat. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), used mainly in single-use plastic bottles, accounts for a substantial fraction of this waste. The currently employed recycling strategies are inadequate to deal with the global plastic waste problem. PET glycolysis is a promising depolymerization method but has mainly been conducted using homogeneous catalysts; developing active and sustainable catalysts, and more energy-efficient processes remain challenges. Here, we implement microwave heating in PET glycolysis and identify ZnO as an excellent heterogeneous catalyst. We demonstrate the influence of ZnO's particle size and facet and hydrogen bonding on its activity. Finally, we demonstrate excellent performance for real-world post-consumer PET waste deconstruction with rapid depolymerization into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving > 95% yields in less than 10 min. Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment also indicates that BHET produced by ZnO-catalyzed glycolysis has lower global warming potential than the petrochemical-based production and homogeneously-catalyzed glycolysis.
