You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste-to-Energy technologies for municipal solid waste management: Bibliometric review, life cycle assessment, and energy potential case study Inadequate municipal solid waste (MSW) management threatens public health and the environment. The waste-to-energy (WtE) route allows the production of electricity, heat, and other valuable chemical products. WtE consists of incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, and some emerging technologies. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct a bibliometric analysis of WtE technologies for MSW management research. Scopus-indexed articles were examined between 1971 and 2023. Four periods were defined and analyzed in terms of their most significant results. In addition, the most pertinent journals (Waste Management, Chemosphere, and Waste Management & Research) ranked first, second, and third, respectively. Moreover, the top contributor countries include one in America (the United States), three in Asia (China, Japan, and India), and five in Europe (Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). Throughout a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) case study, the environmental performance of gasification and incineration were compared as relevant technologies for treating MSW were contrasted. Gasification excelled in seven environmental parameters, suggesting that developing strategies for MSW gasification on a commercial scale should prioritize this aspect. Finally, the energy potential was assessed, which provided valuable information on the societal benefits of WtE technologies in various sectors, such as education, health, and electromobility. Under their respective contexts, stakeholders should enhance MSW sorting policies, pretreatment methods, and emerging valorization options. The growing global interest in WtE requires a social, environmental, and economic evaluation before implementation.
