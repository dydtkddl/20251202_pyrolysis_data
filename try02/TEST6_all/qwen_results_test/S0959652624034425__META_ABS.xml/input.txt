Waste-to-Energy technologies for municipal solid waste management: Bibliometric review, life cycle assessment, and energy potential case study Inadequate municipal solid waste (MSW) management threatens public health and the environment. The waste-to-energy (WtE) route allows the production of electricity, heat, and other valuable chemical products. WtE consists of incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, and some emerging technologies. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct a bibliometric analysis of WtE technologies for MSW management research. Scopus-indexed articles were examined between 1971 and 2023. Four periods were defined and analyzed in terms of their most significant results. In addition, the most pertinent journals (Waste Management, Chemosphere, and Waste Management & Research) ranked first, second, and third, respectively. Moreover, the top contributor countries include one in America (the United States), three in Asia (China, Japan, and India), and five in Europe (Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). Throughout a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) case study, the environmental performance of gasification and incineration were compared as relevant technologies for treating MSW were contrasted. Gasification excelled in seven environmental parameters, suggesting that developing strategies for MSW gasification on a commercial scale should prioritize this aspect. Finally, the energy potential was assessed, which provided valuable information on the societal benefits of WtE technologies in various sectors, such as education, health, and electromobility. Under their respective contexts, stakeholders should enhance MSW sorting policies, pretreatment methods, and emerging valorization options. The growing global interest in WtE requires a social, environmental, and economic evaluation before implementation.
