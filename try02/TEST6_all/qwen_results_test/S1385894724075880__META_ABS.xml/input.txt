Effect of CeO2 morphology and Ru impregnation method on CH4 selectivity reduction in polyethylene waste conversion to liquid fuels and lubricants Hydrogenolysis of polyolefins offers a sustainable pathway by giving plastic waste a second life as valuable resources, transforming it into fuels and lubricants. Supported Ru catalysts have shown potential for depolymerizing polyolefins under mild conditions; however, depolymerization via terminal C-C bond cleavage can lead to the excessive formation of CH4. This study investigated the effects of CeO2 morphology and Ru impregnation method on the suppression of CH4 formation and increasing liquid and wax proportions (C5-C41) in the production of liquid fuels and lubricants through polyethylene hydrogenolysis. Controlling the morphology of CeO2 and impregnating Ru via electrostatic adsorption can enhance the formation of oxygen vacancies and strengthen the interaction between Ru and CeO2. The presence of defects in CeO2 also correlated with smaller particle size of Ru and a higher hydrogen reservoir site, which effectively suppress CH4 formation.
