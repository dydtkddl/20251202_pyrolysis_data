Advanced engineered nanostructures for aerospace technology: A review Engineered structural nanocomposites with tunable properties is immensely useful in the area of next generation aerospace engineering. Therefore, this review gives an elaborate account on diverse applications of nanomaterials for the advanced aerospace technology. Graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based materials synthesized employing pyrolysis are used in the linear actuator multilayer insulation support (LAMLIS), proton exchange membrane fuel cell, propulsion system of CubeSat ALICE, low power neutralizer for electrospray thrusters, radiometer’s light absorber for RAVAN, and fillers for development of structural part of the spacecraft. Metal oxide based composites such as, TiO2NPs, ZnONPs, SnO2NPs, MgONPs, ZnO2NPs, CrO2NPs, CuZnONPs, CoZnONPs, and NiZnONPs are widely used in energy storage devices, dye-sensitized cells, anode material for lithium-ion batteries, fuel droplet combustion of rocket propellant grade 2 fuel, and thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) based composite solid propellants (CSPs). Nanocomposites with MgH2-VTi-CNTs, RuNPs, Mg2NiH4 NPs, SiO2NPs, ZrO2, Ir, and AlNCs help in different in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and life support by providing thermal insulation for space suits and aircrafts that protects from radiation and temperature fluctuations. Thus, incorporation of nanocomposites with improved thermoelectric properties and mechanical strength into aerospace components is a rational approach to facilitate space exploration initiatives.
