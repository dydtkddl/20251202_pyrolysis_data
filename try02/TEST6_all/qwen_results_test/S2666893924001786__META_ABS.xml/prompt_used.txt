You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plant-based chitosan for the development of biodegradable packaging materials Plant-derived materials and edible films have developed as viable substitutes for standard packaging materials, enabling sustainable and ecologically acceptable alternatives. Chitosan, a cationic carbohydrate polymer derived from animal or marine sources, as well as from agricultural waste such as mushrooms or various fungi possesses excellent properties such as film formation, mechanical strength, non-toxicity, biodegradability, edibility, UV-blocking ability, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial functionality, justifying its potential as packaging/coating material for fresh agricultural products. Chitosan is obtained through the deacetylation of chitin. The quantity of waste generated in a mushroom farm varies from 5–20 % of the total yielding quantity. Filamentous fungi's cellular structure, which is rich in chitin, provides a convenient method for chitin extraction. Fungal-derived chitosan offers the advantage of controllable physicochemical characteristics, including degree of deacetylation and molecular weight, compared to chitosan obtained from crustaceans. This versatility makes fungal chitosan suitable for various utilizations in food, pharmaceutical, and biomedical management. It can be utilised for different purposes in these fields. This review primarily emphasizes the extraction of chitin from mushrooms and various fungal sources, comparing different extraction methods and chitosan-based materials fabrication techniques. Additionally, it discusses the crucial characteristics of chitosan that make it convenient for high value-added functions in the food industry. To sum up, plant-based chitosan films have the potential to completely transform the packaging sector by providing environmentally friendly substitutes for traditional materials. Accepting these advances will help build a more resilient and sustainable earth, encourage the circular economy, and reduce the amount of plastic trash produced.
