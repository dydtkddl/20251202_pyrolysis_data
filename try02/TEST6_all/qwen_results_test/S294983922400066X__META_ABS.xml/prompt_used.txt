You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Repurposing lignin rich biorefinery waste streams into the next generation of sustainable solid fuels Value added lignin rich waste sludges from biorefinery processes are, as yet untapped valuable feedstocks that can be reformed into clean, high quality solid fuels. By water washing sludges produced from base hydrolyzed waste, a material stripped of water-soluble alkali and alkaline earth metals (ash) can be obtained. This work shows how leached bagasse, barley and wheat straw sludges can be valorised into clean, low ash solid biofuels that can be used to supplement global energy demands. Repurposed lignin rich sludges of 1.00–2.00 mm particle size feedstocks were found to exhibit calorific values +17.3 %, +16.8 % and +11.7 % for bagasse, wheat, and barley straw sludges, respectively higher than their untreated waste counterparts. Additionally, by employing densification in the absence of a binder, <0.25 mm particles of leached sludge feedstocks were found to experience 16.0 % (bagasse), 12.0 % (wheat) and 4.0 % (barley) increases to their calorific values. This provides options for sustained energy from waste production and consumption campaigns, diversifying feedstock options for green solid fuels
