You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Scalable deposition techniques for large-area perovskite photovoltaic technology: A multi-perspective review Perovskite photovoltaic technology holds great promise for the solar energy industry due to its high efficiency and fascinating potentialities for low-cost production. However, overcoming stability and scalability challenges by addressing environmental concerns is crucial for their successful deployment in the market. While perovskite solar cells have shown promising power conversion efficiency and long-term lifetime once produced by using small-scale production facilities, the scaling up of the device production without losing in performance and stability, still remains a not-trivial task. As matter of the fact, research and development efforts are currently ongoing to bring the perovskite solar technology closer to the market. From this point of view, the choice and the optimization of a specific deposition method depends on several factors like scalability, cost-effectiveness, and peculiar requirements required by the featured application. In this review, a comprehensive description of deposition methods for large area substrate is provided followed by an exhaustive collection of the main published progresses on large area perovskite solar devices. In particular, the large-area compatible deposition techniques will be categorized in the two main families based on solution and physical deposition processes, while pros and cons of both families are investigated in view of their potentialities for low-cost and high-throughput industrial production. Not least, hybrid deposition methods combining specific features of both solution and vacuum deposition techniques will be suggested as a way to leverage both their advantages. In addition, the main characterization techniques for large area devices will be described as a powerful way to select the proper deposition technique for supporting the development of commercial product based on perovskite technology. The opened challenges and the new routes for moving perovskite from lab to fab are finally suggested and discussed.
