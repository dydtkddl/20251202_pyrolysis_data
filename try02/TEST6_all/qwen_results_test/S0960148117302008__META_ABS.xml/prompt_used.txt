You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of different operating parameters on the syngas composition in a two-stage gasification process This research used a two-stage fluidized-bed gasifier to investigate the effects of the temperature, equivalence ratio, and steam/biomass ratio on the syngas composition. When the operating temperature in the first stage increased from 700 °C to 900 °C, the proportion of H2 in the syngas increased significantly. After passing through the second stage (900 °C), the syngas produced from the first stage underwent the thermal reaction again, and the proportion of H2 was further increased. When the ER value increased from 0.2 to 0.3, the proportion of H2 in the syngas increased; whereas, when the ER value increased to 0.4, the amount of H2 produced was reduced. For S/B ratio, an increase to 0.5 enhanced the steam content of the gasifier and accelerated the methane–steam reforming reaction, thus producing more H2 (up to 52 mol%). Furthermore, when the operating temperature of the fluidized bed reactor at the second stage was set at 900 °C, the proportion of H2 in the syngas could still be effectively improved to more than 42 mol% although the operating temperature at the first stage was only 700 °C. The proportion of H2 was enhanced to more than 52 mol% with a combination of appropriate ER and S/B ratio values.
