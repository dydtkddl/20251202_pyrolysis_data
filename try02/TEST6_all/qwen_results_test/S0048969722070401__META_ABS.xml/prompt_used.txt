You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar–goethite composites inhibited/enhanced degradation of triphenyl phosphate by activating persulfate: Insights on the mechanism In this study, the biochar–goethite composites (MBC@FH) were synthesized through co–ball milling and the degradation of triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) was compared in persulfate (PDS) alone system and MBC@FH&PDS systems. The results showed that TPhP can be effectively degraded in PDS alone system and degradation efficiency reached up to 90 % within reaction of 8 h, at a PDS concentration of 10 mM, a reaction temperature of 30 °C and a system pH of 6.12. The obvious degradation can be ascribed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by self–decompose of PDS, among which 1O2, ∙OH and O2∙− play a major role in the degradation process. Although 350 °C biochar–goethite composites (MBC35@FH) and 800 °C biochar–goethite composites (MBC80@FH) facilitated PDS activation to produce more ROS, the catalytic degradation of TPhP was different in their systems. The degradation of TPhP was inhibited by MBC35@FH due to its stronger adsorption for TPhP, while MBC80@FH promoted TPhP degradation and degradation efficiency was up to 100 % within 6 h. 1O2 and SO4∙− played a stronger degradation role than ∙OH and O2∙− in above systems. The transformation of Fe species, functional groups (oxygen–containing functional groups, pyrrolic nitrogen) and persistent free radicals (PFRs) on the MBC@FH were involved in the PDS activation to produce ROS. Furthermore, MBC80@FH was more capable of activating PDS than MBC35@FH due to its abundant defect sites, larger specific surface area, more PFRs, higher Fe content and stronger electron transfer capability. In addition, seven possible TPhP intermediates were identified and possible degradation pathways of TPhP were proposed accordingly. This study illustrated that not all metallic carbon catalysts are necessarily beneficial for organic contaminants degradation.
