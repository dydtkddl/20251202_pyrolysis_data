You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Crystallization and grain growth characteristics of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition Knowledge about the crystallization and grain growth characteristics of metal oxide thin films is essential for effective microstructural engineering by thermal post-annealing and the integration to Si-based miniaturized electroceramic devices. Finite size and interface effects may cause fundamentally different behavior compared to three dimensional macroscopic systems. This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the crystallization kinetics and microstructural evolution upon thermal post-annealing of amorphous 200nm and 1.2μm thin films of 8mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using ex- and in-situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy techniques. The layers exhibit a remarkably low crystallization temperature of 200–250°C while exposure to energetic electrons induces the formation of randomly dispersed ~20nm sized crystallites already at ambient temperature. The isothermal amorphous to crystalline phase transformation kinetics can be described quantitatively by the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov model. They reveal characteristics of a three dimensional growth under cation bulk diffusion control with heterogeneous nucleation that changes from continuous to instantaneous initial seeding at temperatures above 300°C. Large (>100nm) equiaxed grains are formed rapidly without a stabilization of transient nanocrystals during the thermally induced phase transformation. A stagnation of normal grain growth resulting in a logarithmic normal size distribution is observed once the average grain dimensions approach the film thickness. The results on the crystallization and grain growth of the PLD-grown YSZ films are evaluated with regards to the fabrication of YSZ solid electrolyte membranes for Si-supported micro solid oxide fuel cells and gas sensors.
