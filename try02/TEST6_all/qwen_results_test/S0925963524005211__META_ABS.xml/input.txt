Growth and characterization of carbon nanotubes and study of modified carbon fiber—A review Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention from both academia and industry due to their unique mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Many scholars have been devoted to pursuing its growth mechanism for more than three decades, which is the core of high quality and high yield preparation of CNTs. However, the requirement of exploring its growth mechanism is raised higher, and the combination and cross-use of in situ characterization and machine learning are the key techniques to explore its growth mechanism. The above technologies have important application prospects for the modification and performance enhancement of carbon fiber (CF) on the basis of exploring the growth mechanism of CNTs. And it has been possible to grow CNTs on CF with the trend of industrialization. Therefore, in-depth study of the growth mechanism of CNTs and their enhancement of CF properties is still a key concern and development direction in the future, which has important high-value applications in the manufacture of high-performance products and enhancement of interfacial properties of composite materials.
