You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In depth thermokinetic investigation on Co-pyrolysis of low-rank coal and algae consortium blends over CeO2 loaded hydrotalcite (MgNiAl) catalyst This study investigates the co-pyrolysis behavior of bituminous coal (100%BC), algae consortium (100%AC), and their blends at various blending ratios. The pure and coal-biomass blends were characterized using CHN-S, GCV, and FTIR analysis. Whereas, the co-pyrolysis of blends were performed in a TGA. The deviation between the experimental and calculated values of weight loss (WL%), the residue left (RL%), and the maximum rate of weight loss (wt%/min) was used to calculate the synergistic effects. Kinetic parameters were investigated using the Coats-Redfern integral method through eighteen (18) reaction mechanistic models. The activation energy (Ea) for 100%BC was 85.04 kJ/mol through the F3 model, whilst for 100%AC showed 78.22 kJ/mol using the D3 model. Thermodynamic parameters such as Enthalpy ( ∆ H ) and Gibbs free energy ( ∆ G ) showed positive values, while Entropy ( ∆ S ) was negative for each coal-biomass blend. The catalytic co-pyrolysis of the optimum blend (20BCE-80AC) was studied using CeO2 loaded MgNiAl (CeO2 @MNA) as a multifunctional catalyst. The increased WL% displayed a positive effect toward a higher yield of volatile matter. Ea of the optimum blend in co-pyrolysis was further reduced through catalytic co-pyrolysis and Ea in the first and second stages was 72.48 kJ/mol and 13.76 kJ/mol, while 3 wt% catalyst loading further reduced its Ea in both stages to 67.82 kJ/mol and 41.21 kJ/mol. The use of CeO2 @MNA at 3 wt% loading showed a reduction in the peak devolatilization temperature (Tp) of the optimum blend substantially increasing the reaction rate, and reducing the Ea required for the decomposition process.
