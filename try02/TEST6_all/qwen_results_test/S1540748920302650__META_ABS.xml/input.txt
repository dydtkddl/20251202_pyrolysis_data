Unraveling synergistic effects on pyrolysis reactivity and indene formation in co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene Synergistic effect is one of the most important interactions between different fuel components and is very influential on combustion characteristics such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and soot emissions, pyrolysis/oxidation reactivity and so on. In order to explore the potential synergistic effects between aromatics and open-chained fuels, pure toluene pyrolysis, pure acetylene pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene were investigated in a flow reactor using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry at 1057–1340 K and 1 atm. Mole fractions of fuels and key products including both stable and reactive ones were evaluated. The experimental results indicate that in the co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene, the decomposition of both fuels is greatly stimulated and the formation of indene is significantly improved compared to the pyrolysis of pure toluene and pure acetylene. As a result, remarkable synergistic effects can be observed on pyrolysis reactivity and indene formation. A kinetic model for co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene was updated from our previous toluene model and was validated against the new data. The modeling analysis reveals that the unimolecular decomposition reaction of toluene producing benzyl radical and H atom is the chain-initiation reaction in both pure toluene pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene. In the pure toluene pyrolysis, the self-combination reaction forming bibenzyl dominates the consumption of benzyl radical and results in strong chain termination. In the co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene, instead of the chain-termination reaction, a circulating reaction sequence initiating from the reaction between benzyl radical and acetylene continuously converts toluene and acetylene to indene and H2, which can explain the observed synergistic effects on pyrolysis reactivity and indene formation in the co-pyrolysis of toluene and acetylene.
