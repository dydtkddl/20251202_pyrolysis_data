You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and feasibility study of bio-waste valorization through pyrolysis for energy and materials production in the concept of circular economy The pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis characteristics of large abundant bio-wastes, namely date pits (DP), peanut shells (PS), coffee grounds (CG), and tea waste (TW) were investigated in detail. The TG/DTG and pyrolysis procedures were used to examine the thermal pyrolysis behavior of these agro-wastes and their blends (50%CG/50%DP, 50%CG/50%PS, 50%DP/50%PS, 50%TW/50% DP,50%TW/50%PS and 50%CG/50% TW by weight). The characterization of these feedstock has shown their suitability for energy and material valorization. Experiments were carried out in a batch pyrolysis at a medium heating rate of 10 °C/min. The goal was to identify the best combination aiming to produce either char or hydrogen-rich gas, which can contribute to the development of the circular bio-economy. It was demonstrated that pyrolysis favored the liquid product, fluctuating from 34.31% (TW) to 50.92% (DP), while the co-pyrolysis greatly increased the gaseous product, which ranged between 42.02% (TW-DP) and 55.17% (PS-TW). The blending of CG and PS resulted in heightened reactivity, leading to an enhanced generation of H2 (34.44%). The optimal mixture was found to be CG-TW, showcasing superior performance in terms of gas quality (38.39% H2) and yield (53.74%). This outcome underscores the potential of CG and TW as a synergistic blend for efficient hydrogen-rich gas production. The FTIR findings revealed that the recovered biochars have the potential to serve as solid fuels, biofertilizers, or carbon materials. Additionally, they could be used as eco-friendly precursors for chemical and related industries. By analyzing various waste mixtures and their respective pyrolysis properties, this research aims to contribute to the development of sustainable waste management practices as well as efficient energy and material production methods.
