Prospects for paired electrolysis at industrial currents Paired electrolysis at industrial current densities offers an energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to thermocatalytic chemical synthesis by leveraging anodic and cathodic valorization. However, its industrial feasibility remains constrained by system integration, including reactor assembly, asymmetric electron transfer kinetics, membrane selection, mass transport limitations, and techno-economic bottlenecks. Addressing these challenges requires an engineering-driven approach that integrates reactor architecture, electrode-electrolyte interactions, reaction pairing, and process optimization. Here, we discuss scale-specific electrochemical reactor assembly strategies, transitioning from half-cell research to full-scale stack validation. We develop reaction pairing frameworks that align electrocatalyst design with electrochemical kinetics, enhancing efficiency and selectivity under industrial operating conditions. We also establish application-dependent key performance indicators and benchmark propylene oxidation coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen reduction reaction against existing industrial routes to evaluate process viability. Finally, we propose hybrid integration models that embed paired electrolysis into existing industrial workflows, which could alleviate adoption barriers.
