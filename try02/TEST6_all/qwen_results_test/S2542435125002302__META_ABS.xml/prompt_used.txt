You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prospects for paired electrolysis at industrial currents Paired electrolysis at industrial current densities offers an energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to thermocatalytic chemical synthesis by leveraging anodic and cathodic valorization. However, its industrial feasibility remains constrained by system integration, including reactor assembly, asymmetric electron transfer kinetics, membrane selection, mass transport limitations, and techno-economic bottlenecks. Addressing these challenges requires an engineering-driven approach that integrates reactor architecture, electrode-electrolyte interactions, reaction pairing, and process optimization. Here, we discuss scale-specific electrochemical reactor assembly strategies, transitioning from half-cell research to full-scale stack validation. We develop reaction pairing frameworks that align electrocatalyst design with electrochemical kinetics, enhancing efficiency and selectivity under industrial operating conditions. We also establish application-dependent key performance indicators and benchmark propylene oxidation coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen reduction reaction against existing industrial routes to evaluate process viability. Finally, we propose hybrid integration models that embed paired electrolysis into existing industrial workflows, which could alleviate adoption barriers.
