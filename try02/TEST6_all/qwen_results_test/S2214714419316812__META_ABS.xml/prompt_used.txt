You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient removal of arsenic using plastic waste char: Prevailing mechanism and sorption performance The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low-cost plastic char synthesized from pyrolysis of waste Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Polyethylene (PE) for adsorbing Arsenic (As). Adsorption of As under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against changing pH (4–8), contact time (0–40 min) and a dose of char (0.5–1.5 g). The uptake capability was found to be in the range of 10.7–99.4 %. Amongst all the plastic chars used, PE and PVC mixed char showed the highest removal of As that ranged from 71.6–99.4%. Least amount of sorption was shown by PE and PET chars which was found to be in range of 12.4–32.5%. The optimum equilibrium time of 20 min with acidic medium (pH 6.0) at 1.5 g was the best-favored dose for 99.4 % adsorption of As. Pseudo-Second-Order rate effectively fitted well with removal kinetics, whereas Langmuir isotherm models fitted more accurately to the obtained results. The study concluded that plastic chars have a greater possibility to act as a promising sorbent for effective removal of As.
