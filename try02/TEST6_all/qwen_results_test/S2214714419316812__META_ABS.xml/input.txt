Efficient removal of arsenic using plastic waste char: Prevailing mechanism and sorption performance The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low-cost plastic char synthesized from pyrolysis of waste Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Polyethylene (PE) for adsorbing Arsenic (As). Adsorption of As under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against changing pH (4–8), contact time (0–40 min) and a dose of char (0.5–1.5 g). The uptake capability was found to be in the range of 10.7–99.4 %. Amongst all the plastic chars used, PE and PVC mixed char showed the highest removal of As that ranged from 71.6–99.4%. Least amount of sorption was shown by PE and PET chars which was found to be in range of 12.4–32.5%. The optimum equilibrium time of 20 min with acidic medium (pH 6.0) at 1.5 g was the best-favored dose for 99.4 % adsorption of As. Pseudo-Second-Order rate effectively fitted well with removal kinetics, whereas Langmuir isotherm models fitted more accurately to the obtained results. The study concluded that plastic chars have a greater possibility to act as a promising sorbent for effective removal of As.
