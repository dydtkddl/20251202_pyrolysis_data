Thermolysis of acetylene terminated sulfone resins. II. Oligomeric and residual products of degradation Resins from acetylene terminated sulfone (ATS) fractions and related model compounds have been pyrolysed to 1000°C under high vacuum conditions. The residual and oligomeric product fractions of degradation were isolated using the technique of thermal volatilization analysis (TVA). The residues from degradation were weighed and subjected to compositional analysis by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The oligomeric products of degradation were weighed, isolated into preparative TLC bands, and identified through the joint application of IR and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and chemical ionization mass spectroscopy (CIMS). The residues from thermal degradation proved somewhat intractable. On the other hand, analysis of the oligomeric product fractions provided a wealth of identifiable derivatives which confirmed the major role that random scissions play in the degradation process. Residue yields were shown to increase with the polyene concentration in the cured resin. In contrast, the yields of oligomeric products were shown to be inversely related to polyene concentration in the cured resin. ATS and ATB resin were also aged at 250°C and at 300°C in air. Both resins were stable to weight loss at 250°C but ablated slowly at 300°C in air. The ageing process was accompanied by oxidation of the polyene to carbonyl containing derivatives which are stable at 250°C but unstable at 300°C. The AT resins were significantly more stable to weight loss than epoxy resins containing similar structural motifs.
