You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermolysis of acetylene terminated sulfone resins. II. Oligomeric and residual products of degradation Resins from acetylene terminated sulfone (ATS) fractions and related model compounds have been pyrolysed to 1000°C under high vacuum conditions. The residual and oligomeric product fractions of degradation were isolated using the technique of thermal volatilization analysis (TVA). The residues from degradation were weighed and subjected to compositional analysis by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The oligomeric products of degradation were weighed, isolated into preparative TLC bands, and identified through the joint application of IR and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and chemical ionization mass spectroscopy (CIMS). The residues from thermal degradation proved somewhat intractable. On the other hand, analysis of the oligomeric product fractions provided a wealth of identifiable derivatives which confirmed the major role that random scissions play in the degradation process. Residue yields were shown to increase with the polyene concentration in the cured resin. In contrast, the yields of oligomeric products were shown to be inversely related to polyene concentration in the cured resin. ATS and ATB resin were also aged at 250°C and at 300°C in air. Both resins were stable to weight loss at 250°C but ablated slowly at 300°C in air. The ageing process was accompanied by oxidation of the polyene to carbonyl containing derivatives which are stable at 250°C but unstable at 300°C. The AT resins were significantly more stable to weight loss than epoxy resins containing similar structural motifs.
