You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of palygorskite on in-situ thermal behaviours of clay mixtures and properties of fired bricks Clay mixtures have been added with a palygorskite containing clay at 0 wt% to 50 wt% for brick button firing. Through an effective integration of in-situ temperature controllable XRD, thermogravimetric and dilatometric analyses, the real-time thermal behaviours of clay mixtures were studied. Also, the physical, mechanical and thermal performance of obtained fired brick buttons were investigated. The addition of palygorskite containing clay has increased the content of amorphous phases in fired brick buttons, while quartz, cristobalite, mullite and hematite were suppressed. Cordierite, spinel and magnetite are new minerals developed in obtained brick buttons. From 25 to 1150 °C, the brick green bodies underwent five mass loss steps and six dilatometric/contractions. The fibrous morphology of palygorskite no longer existed after 1150 °C firing. Instead, larger-sized acicular cordierite particles are developed. Adding palygorskite has resulted in lower porosity, higher drying shrinkage, firing shrinkage and compressive strength in fired buttons due to reinforced liquid-phase sintering. The effect of palygorskite on vitrification tended to be non-linear and non-uniform. In addition, the colours of brick buttons changed from “light camel” to “black olive” with palygorskite content. Since cracks were developed on the brick buttons added with 40 wt% and 50 wt% palygorskite containing clay, the optimum addition dosage was set at 30 wt%. The obtained compressive strength and thermal diffusivity (25 °C) at this addition amount are 153.8 MPa (24.5% higher than the control sample) and 0.788 mm2/s, respectively.
