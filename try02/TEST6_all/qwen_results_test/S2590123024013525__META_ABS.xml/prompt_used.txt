You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of Ricinus communis outer shell biomass to biochar: Impact of thermal decomposition temperature on physicochemical properties and EMI shielding performance The rising awareness of electromagnetic pollution has increased interest in renewable and ecologically sustainable materials for shielding electromagnetic waves. Research on carbon-based electromagnetic wave absorption materials derived from agro waste is widely explored due to their advantageous characteristics, including low density and consistent physicochemical properties. The research aims to produce biochar with maximum carbon content from Ricinus communis outer shell (RCOS) and to examine the characteristics of biochar/epoxy composites for their application in electromagnetic (EM) shielding. In this study, the composite made from RCOS-based biochar was effectively developed using slow pyrolysis at 400 °C–700 °C. The characterisations of enhanced properties of biochar were conducted by using yield analysis and proximate analysis, elemental analysis, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), electrical conductivity. The biochar pyrolysis results revealed that the biochar yield, fixed carbon and maximum carbon content were 30 wt%, 50.49 wt% and 79.2 wt%, respectively, at 700 °C. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that for the biochar at 700 °C, C=C and C-H functional groups were present, and the others were eliminated as volatile gases during biochar production. TG analysis demonstrated higher biochar stability with residues of 75 % for 700 °C. The biochar produced at 700 °C possesses the maximum electrical conductivity of 95 S/m due to the presence of graphitic carbon. The vector network analyser (VNA) measured a maximum shielding efficiency of 26.5 dB in the X-band frequency when adding 40 wt% biochar prepared at 700 °C to the epoxy matrix. The results suggest that the RCOS biochar/epoxy composites have promise as a novel type of absorbent materials because of their low density, lightweight structure, and extensive absorption capacities. These biochar-based lightweight composites can be used as a shielding material for electronic enclosures, telecommunication equipment, and aerospace applications.
