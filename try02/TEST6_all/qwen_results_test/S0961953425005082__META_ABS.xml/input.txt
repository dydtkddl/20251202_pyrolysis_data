Native and tailor-made microbial cell factories for economic production of bio-renewables: A paradigm shift in industrial biotechnology This review explores the roles of microbial cell factories (MCFs) in the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass for the development of sustainable biorefineries. MCFs are engineered microorganisms optimized to produce valuable bioproducts from renewable resources. Advances in strain engineering, metabolic pathway optimization, and enzyme production are driving the development of efficient consolidated bioprocessing of biomass, where enzyme production is coupled with biomass hydrolysis and fermentation. However, challenges remain, including the high cost of enzymes, inhibition by lignin, and scale-up. The review highlights key strategies for improving the performance of MCFs, including the use of cell immobilization, strain optimization for lignin degradation, and enhanced enzyme stability through protein engineering. The potential for these MCFs to integrate lignin valorization and overcome biomass processing challenges is fundamental for scalability and overall feasibility of biorefineries. The review also discusses regulatory considerations and the commercial viability of key processes and products associated with such cell factories.
