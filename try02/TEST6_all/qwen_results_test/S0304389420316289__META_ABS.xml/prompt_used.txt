You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Weakening the strong Fe-La interaction in A-site-deficient perovskite via Ni substitution to promote the thermocatalytic synthesis of carbon nanotubes from plastics The variation of metal-support interaction (MSI) plays a key role in the synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based on chemical vapor deposition process. This work concentrates on weakening the interaction of Fe-La in an A-site-deficient perovskite (La0.8FeO3-δ) via Ni partial substitution. After reductive treatment, the catalysts were employed for thermocatalytic synthesis of CNTs from plastics. Following the structural, morphological and chemical changes, the catalytic activities of the reductive La0.8NixFe1-xO3-δ (H-LNxF1-x, x = 0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) were correlated with the degree of MSI. Compared with H-LF sample, the H-LN0.15F0.85 sample exhibited the highest catalytic activity, which was attributable to the highest surface coverage of metals as well as the synergistic effect of Fe and Ni species. The yield of CNTs produced from low density polyethylene was 1.44 g/gcatalyst over the H-LN0.15F0.85 sample, which was much higher than that over H-LF sample (0.38 g/gcatalyst).
