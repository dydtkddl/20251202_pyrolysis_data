You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A promising treatment method for Cr(VI) detoxification and recovery by coupling Fe0/Fe3C/C fine powders and circulating fluidized bed This study reports an innovative and efficient method of coupling highly active Fe0/Fe3C/C powders and circulating fluidized bed (Fe0/Fe3C/C CFB) for the treatment of Cr(VI) containing water via detoxification and Cr recovery. It can overcome the shortcomings of Fe/C micro-electrolysis in the conventional fixed bed such as descending chemical reactivity and hydraulic permeability. The effects of inlet Cr(VI) concentration, initial solution pH, gas velocities, solid holdup and hydraulic retention time on the reactor performance were detailedly investigated. The results proved that Fe0/Fe3C/C CFB showed a much high superficial liquid velocity and it favor the increase of reaction dynamics, whereas the surplus solid holdup caused a significant hydrogen evolution. Moreover, due to its inhibited particle self-agglomeration and preserved gap structure, CFB has a much higher performance in terms of efficiency and longevity compared with fixed bed. Based on the qualitative characterizations (XPS, XRD and in-situ Raman), 100% Cr(VI) conversion concurrent with microcrystalline Fe derivatives were found on the surface of Fe0/Fe3C/C in CFB. Quantitative analysis (Mossbauer and acid extraction) demonstrated that the exposed crystallite of selectively catalytic adsorbed Fe(II) speciation was responsible to successive electron transfer in Cr(VI) treatment. Hence, 47% Fe0 utilization and 91.7% Cr(III) recovery proved satisfied compatibility between Fe0/Fe3C/C and CFB. In general, the Fe0/Fe3C/C CFB would provide theoretical basis and technological guidance for the improvement of Fe/C process in industry.
