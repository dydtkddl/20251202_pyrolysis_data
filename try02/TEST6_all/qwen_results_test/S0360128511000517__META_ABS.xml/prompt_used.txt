You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation of carbon nanoparticles from the gas phase in shock wave pyrolysis processes This review deals with the most recent achievements in experimental investigations of the process of carbon nanoparticle formation, at pyrolysis of various carbon bearing species behind shock waves. The diverse diagnostic methods of these processes are described; special attention is given to new methods for measuring the current sizes and optical properties of particles and the temperature of the reacting mixture using time resolved laser-induced incandescence (LII), and IR emission-absorption spectroscopy. The main part of the review provides critical analysis of the numerous results of the kinetics of particle formation at various temperatures, pressures and concentrations of carbon. Particular emphasis is placed on the results obtained by pyrolysis of hydrogen free precursors. It is shown that recent measurements of size dependence of the optical properties of particles, actual temperature of the mixture during pyrolysis of initial substances, and the subsequent growth of nanoparticles require a serious revision of current conceptions regarding the temperature dependence of particle yield and growth rate. Based on this analysis, unified regularities in these processes, with various temperatures and types of initial substances, are suggested. The last section of the paper contains a short review of the methods for modeling the processes of carbon nanoparticle formation in shock waves. Emphasis is placed on the necessity for the elaboration of more general models describing the detailed changes in particle properties during the growth process and the unified regularities of particle growth from hydrocarbons and hydrogen-free precursors as determined in experiments.
