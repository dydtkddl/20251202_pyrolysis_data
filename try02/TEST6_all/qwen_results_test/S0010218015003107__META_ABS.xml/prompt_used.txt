You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution of size distribution and morphology of carbon nanoparticles during ethylene pyrolysis The effects of furnace temperature and residence time on particle size distributions (PSDs) of carbon black, which is a type of carbon nanoparticle, were studied with a scanning mobility particle sizer. Particles were classified according to their mobility diameters by a differential mobility analyzer, followed by thermophoretic sampling by scanning electron microscopy to investigate their carbon black morphologies. PSDs were power-law distributions at short residence times and log-normal distributions at long residence times; these distributions indicate that agglomeration increases with increasing residence time. In addition, few 2.5-nm-sized particles existed above 1540 ± 40 K, while the critical size was 3 nm at 1350 ± 40 K. This finding indicates that the critical size of nuclei changes with temperature. At high temperatures of 1776 and 1676 K, the 100 and 180-nm-sized particles, whose primary particles kept their shape, had very complex morphologies. In contrast, at low temperature at 1570 K, the morphologies of 100 and 180-nm-sized aggregates are relativity simple, and primary particles nearly fused together in those aggregates. These observations indicate that the nucleation rate and fusing behavior change with temperature.
