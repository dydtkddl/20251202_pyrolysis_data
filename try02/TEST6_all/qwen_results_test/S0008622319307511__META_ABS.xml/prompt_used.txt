You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modulating non-linear optical absorption through controlled graphitization of carbon nanostructures containing Fe3C-graphite core-shell nanoparticles Carbonaceous materials containing Fe/Fe3C(core)-graphite(shell) nanoparticles-embedded carbon globules and carbon nanotubes are synthesized using pyrolysis. The thickness of the graphitic shell on the Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles was varied by exposing Fe-acetylacetonate and toluene precursors to different initial temperatures (reaction tube insertion temperatures) T in . Furthermore, the thickness of the graphitic layer and the degree of graphitization along with the defect concentration in the graphitic layer was controlled by this process. A proposed mechanism for the formation of such carbonaceous nanostructures due to variation of T in is provided. Non-linear absorption (NLA) experiments were carried out to explore the effect of graphitization and the role of defects on the laser intensity dependent NLA behaviour of these samples. We demonstrate that degree of graphitization and defect concentration in the highly graphitized layers considerably enhances the NLA behaviour of high intensity laser radiation in the material. The enhancement of NLA coefficient is mainly attributed to the excited state absorption (ESA) and free carrier absorption (FCA) processes. Our results emphasize that the reported carbonaceous materials with optimum amount of defects in the graphitized framework are attractive for optical limiting in laser safety applications.
