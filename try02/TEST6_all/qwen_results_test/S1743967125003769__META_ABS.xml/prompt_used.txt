You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-driven chemical recycling: Tailoring kinetics to polymer waste complexity Precise kinetic models are required for the chemical recycling of polymer waste by pyrolysis to predict conversion and reaction rates, which are fundamental for developing a reactor model. This study evaluates the pyrolysis kinetics of three polymer wastes of different complexity: end-of-life tires, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene. For this purpose, thermogravimetric data obtained at three different heating rates were analyzed using two complementary approaches: 1) a single-step method combining isoconversional and master plot techniques, and 2) a multi-step distributed activation energy model. This work is crucial because it provides the first systematic comparison of fitted conversion and reaction rate curves against experimental data, filling a gap in the existing literature. The results show that the complexity of the feedstock influences the accuracy of the model: The distributed activation energy model outperforms single-step methods for end-of-life tires and correctly captures their multi-component degradation (complex matrix containing natural and synthetic rubber). On the other hand, Friedman/master plots work better for simpler polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, which contain ethylene glycol and terephtalic acid, and styrene, respectively. The derived kinetic parameters enable precise description of temperature-dependent reaction progress, and are the first step in reactor design. This work establishes a waste-specific framework for selecting kinetic models, thereby advancing scalable pyrolysis processes.
