You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A new eco-friendly packaging system incorporating lignocellulose nanofibres from agri-food residues applied to fresh-cut lettuce The present work explored the design and testing, at pilot scale, of a new food packaging prototype, based on biodegradable polymers and eco-materials obtained from agri-food residues using an environmentally friendly process for its application in vegetable products. For this purpose, several film formulations were developed with combinations of polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (Ecoflex®), incorporating different proportions of lignocellulose nanofibres (LCNF) obtained from an enzymatic pre-treatment of wheat straw waste. The production of the LCNF-reinforced packaging (i.e., bag) was carried out at pilot scale. The assessment of its physico-chemical properties showed an improvement of the optical properties, water vapour permeability and antioxidant capacity as compared to a fresh-cut lettuce commercial package. The improvement was more evident in formulations of 70:30 PLA:Ecoflex® with 0.5 and 1% LCNF. The application of the new formulated packaging in a product of fresh-cut lettuce was also tested by simulating real manufacturing, packaging and storage conditions at pilot scale. Results demonstrated levels of microbiological and sensory quality comparable to those observed in the commercial formulation. This work demonstrates that the development of packaging systems obtained from biodegradable materials and valorised with plant biomass from agri-food activity could be the basis for the creation of a more environmentally sustainable food packaging strategy.
