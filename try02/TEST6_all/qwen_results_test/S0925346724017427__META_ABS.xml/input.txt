Isobornyl acrylate‐based photosensitive resins for high-resolution digital light processing 3D printing of garnet ceramics Several photosensitive resins suitable for digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing were developed using own-synthesized garnet oxide powder and other commercially available components. These resins, combined with using of desktop DLP 3D printer, a simple air-debinding process, and subsequent pressureless sintering at high temperatures, enabled the fabrication of dense, defect-free, and semitransparent (Gd, Y)3Al2Ga3O12:Ce ceramics. The precision of the structural elements in the resulting lattice ceramics reached 200 μm, and the structural and optical properties were studied. Regardless of the initial resin composition, the light yield of the resulted ceramics under gamma-radiation was found to be 38–40 photons/keV, with a typical photoluminescence decay time of approximately 65 ns. Such structured ceramics have potential applications for evaluation of radioactive contaminations in gases and liquids, inbuilt monitors of the charged particles beams and imaging techniques utilizing X-rays and thermal neutrons.
