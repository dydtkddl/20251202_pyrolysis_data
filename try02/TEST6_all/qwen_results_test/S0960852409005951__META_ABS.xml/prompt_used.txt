You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of pyrolysis condition on switchgrass bio-oil yield and physicochemical properties The poor and inconsistent physicochemical properties of bio-oil are inhibiting its industrialized production. We investigated the variability in properties of switchgrass bio-oil produced at three pyrolysis temperatures (T =450, 500, and 550°C) and three feedstock moisture contents (MC=5%, 10%, and 15%) in a 3×3 factorial experiment in order to exploit opportunities to improve bio-oil properties through optimization of pyrolysis parameters. Results showed that even with the single type of feedstock and pyrolysis system, the two main factors and their interaction caused large variations in bio-oil yield and most of the measured physicochemical properties. Following improvements of bio-oil properties could be individually achieved by selecting an optimal pyrolysis condition (shown in parenthesis) comparing with the worst case: increase of bio-oil yield by more than twofold (MC=10%, T =450°C), increase of pH by 20.4% from 2.74 to 3.3 (MC=10%, T =550°C), increase of higher heating value by 18.1% from 16.6 to 19.6MJ/kg (MC=10%, T =450°C), decrease of density by 5.9% from 1.18 to 1.11g/cm3 (MC=5%, T =550°C), decrease of water content by 36% from 31.4 to 20.1wt.% (MC=5%, T =450°C), decrease of viscosity by 40% from 28.2 to 17 centistokes (MC=5%, T =550°C), decrease of solid content by 57% from 2.86 to 1.23wt.% (MC=15%, T =550°C), and decrease of ash content by 41.9% from 0.62 to 0.36wt.% (MC=15%, T =550°C). There is no single, clear-cut optimal condition that can satisfy the criteria for a bio-oil product with all the desired properties. Trade-offs should be balanced according to the usage of the end-products.
