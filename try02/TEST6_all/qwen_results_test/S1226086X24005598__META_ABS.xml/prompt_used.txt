You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

NiO-LaCoO3 catalysts for biomass pyrolysis to hydrogen-rich gas This study presents a new pathway for effective and environmentally friendly hydrogen generation from biomass pyrolysis using perovskite-type catalysts for highly valuable biomass conversion. Firstly, the impact of different Ni doping levels on LaCoO3 catalytic reactivity was investigated. On this basis, the impacts of different carbide slag adding proportions and reaction temperatures on the hydrogen yield and concentration were investigated. Among them, the maximum hydrogen yield at 600 °C under Ni3La2Co2 catalyst is 553.79 mL/gbiomass when the proportion of carbide slag is 5:15, and the volume concentration of hydrogen is 62.67 vol%. The outcomes demonstrated that the prepared NiO-LaCoO3 has excellent cycling performance, and the hydrogen yield of the Ni3La2Co2 catalyst decreased only marginally from 546.98 mL/gbiomass to 503.94 mL/gbiomass after ten cycles, with a comparatively small reduction of only 7.87 %. In particular, a high hydrogen concentration of 63.43 vol% is maintained in the pyrolysis gas.
