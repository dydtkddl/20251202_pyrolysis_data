NiO-LaCoO3 catalysts for biomass pyrolysis to hydrogen-rich gas This study presents a new pathway for effective and environmentally friendly hydrogen generation from biomass pyrolysis using perovskite-type catalysts for highly valuable biomass conversion. Firstly, the impact of different Ni doping levels on LaCoO3 catalytic reactivity was investigated. On this basis, the impacts of different carbide slag adding proportions and reaction temperatures on the hydrogen yield and concentration were investigated. Among them, the maximum hydrogen yield at 600 °C under Ni3La2Co2 catalyst is 553.79 mL/gbiomass when the proportion of carbide slag is 5:15, and the volume concentration of hydrogen is 62.67 vol%. The outcomes demonstrated that the prepared NiO-LaCoO3 has excellent cycling performance, and the hydrogen yield of the Ni3La2Co2 catalyst decreased only marginally from 546.98 mL/gbiomass to 503.94 mL/gbiomass after ten cycles, with a comparatively small reduction of only 7.87 %. In particular, a high hydrogen concentration of 63.43 vol% is maintained in the pyrolysis gas.
