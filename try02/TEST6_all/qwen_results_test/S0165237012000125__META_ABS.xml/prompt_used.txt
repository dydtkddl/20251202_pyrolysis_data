You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Syngas production from pyrolysis–catalytic steam reforming of waste biomass in a continuous screw kiln reactor A two-stage continuous screw-kiln reactor was investigated for the production of synthesis gas (syngas) from the pyrolysis of biomass in the form of waste wood and subsequent catalytic steam reforming of the pyrolysis oils and gases. Four nickel based catalysts; NiO/Al2O3, NiO/CeO2/Al2O3, NiO/SiO2 (prepared by an incipient wetness method) and another NiO/SiO2 (prepared by a sol–gel method), were synthesized and used in the catalytic steam reforming process. Pyrolysis of the biomass at a rapid heating rate of approximately 40°C/s, was carried out at a pyrolysis temperature of 500°C and the second stage reforming of the evolved pyrolysis gases was carried out with a catalytic bed kept at a temperature of 760°C. Gases were analysed using gas chromatography while the fresh and reacted catalyst was analysed by scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The reactor design was shown to be effective for the pyrolysis and catalytic steam reforming of biomass with a maximum syngas yield of 54.0wt.% produced when the sol–gel prepared NiO/SiO2 catalyst was used, which had the highest surface area of 765m2 g−1. The maximum H2 production of 44.4vol.% was obtained when the NiO/Al2O3 catalyst was used.
