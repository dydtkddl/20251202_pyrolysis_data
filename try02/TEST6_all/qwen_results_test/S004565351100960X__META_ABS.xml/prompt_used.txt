You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric kinetic analysis and pollutant evolution during the pyrolysis and combustion of mobile phone case The increase in electronic waste, including cellular telephones, worldwide is a worrying reality. For this reason, urgent action on the management of these wastes is necessary within a framework that respects the environment and human health. Mobile phone components can be physically segregated through grinding at the dismantling sites, in order to reuse or reprocess (via chemical or physical recycling) the recovered plastics and valuable metals. A kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case has been carried out under different conditions by thermogravimetry. Several experiments were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere (pyrolysis runs) and also in an oxidative atmosphere with two different oxygen concentrations (10% and 20% oxygen in nitrogen). Dynamic runs and dynamic+isothermal runs have been carried out to obtain much decomposition data under different operating conditions. Moreover some TG–MS runs were performed in order to better understand the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case and identify some compounds emitted during the controlled heating of this material. A scheme of two independent reactions for pseudocomponents has been proposed for the pyrolysis process. For the combustion runs, the scheme proposed includes two pyrolytic reactions competing with other two reactions with formation of an intermediate residue, and finally the reaction of oxidation/burning of the intermediate residue. Furthermore, pyrolysis and combustion runs at 500°C in a horizontal laboratory furnace were carried out. More than 50 compounds, including carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified and quantified. The main semivolatile compounds detected were phenol and styrene. Furthermore, polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like PCBs produced were analyzed. In the combustion run, PCDDs were obtained in higher amounts than PCDFs and HxCDD was the most emitted homologue.
