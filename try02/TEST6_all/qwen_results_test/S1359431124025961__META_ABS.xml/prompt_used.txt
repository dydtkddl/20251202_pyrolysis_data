You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pulverization of municipal solid waste and utilization of pulverized product as alternative fuel for blast furnace injection In order to utilize municipal solid waste (MSW) in blast furnace ironmaking to realize synergistic reduction of pollution and carbon emissions, a novel method for pulverization of MSW by low temperature heat treatment and crushing, and evaluation of the properties of pulverized product for blast furnace injection were performed. In the present research work, residual waste obtained from MSW classification under the conditions of most Chinese cities was used as the representative raw material. The crushing performance of MSW can be improved by heat treatment. Considering the weight loss ratio, pulverization effect and density of heated MSW at different temperatures and durations, the optimal heat treatment parameters can be set as 300 °C and 20 min. The volatile content, fixed carbon content, ash content, S content, lower heating value of the pulverized product were 61.56 wt%, 19.02 wt%, 19.42 wt%, 0.39 wt% and 25.47 kJ/g, respectively. The pulverized product had worse fluidity and similar jet flow compared to industrial injection coal. Its decomposition heat for injection was 1732 kJ/kg. The initial combustion temperature and burnout temperature of the mixed fuel gradually decreased with the increasing of added pulverized product due to its much better combustion property. About 0.163 kg CO2 can be reduced if 1 kg of raw MSW was injected into blast furnace. The experimental results demonstrates that the obtained pulverized MSW could be used for blast furnace ironmaking to some extent as an environmentally friendly, low-carbon, and economically substitute of fossil fuel.
