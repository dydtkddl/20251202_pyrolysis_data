You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrotreating of compounds containing both oxygen and sulfur: effect of para-hydroxyl substituent on the reactions of mercapto and methylmercapto groups The effect of a hydroxyl substituent on the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of mercapto and methylmercaptobenzene was studied using a commercial presulfided CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst in a batch reactor under hydrotreating conditions (160–280°C, 7 MPa). Mercaptobenzene, (methylmercapto)benzene, phenol, 4-mercaptophenol and 4-(methylmercapto)phenol were used as model compounds. The reaction data was evaluated using a pseudo first-order rate model. Thermal reactions of the model compounds were tested separately. The rates of HDS of the mercapto and the methylmercapto substituent were strongly affected by the presence of a hydroxyl substituent in the para position. At 200°C, the HDS reaction rates of 4-mercaptophenol and 4-(methylmercapto)phenol were respectively 4.5 and 3.0 times higher than those of the corresponding oxygen-free compounds. The activation energies of HDS followed the order of the electronegativity of the sulfur atom; the activation energy was about 15% higher for the oxygen-containing compounds, and the methylation of the mercapto group increased the energies further by about the same amount. Thermal reactions of the mercapto group were also significant in the presence of the hydroxyl substituent. HDO of the phenolic hydroxyl was, on the other hand, suppressed in the presence of sulfur-containing substituents.
