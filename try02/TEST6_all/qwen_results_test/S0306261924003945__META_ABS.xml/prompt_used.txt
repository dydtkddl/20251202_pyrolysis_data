You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A virtuous cycle for thermal treatment of polyvinyl chloride and fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass In this study, a highly corrosive substance, hydrogen chloride (HCl), obtained through the dechlorination of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), was utilized for acid pretreatment in the production of lignocellulosic bioethanol. The study determined that the optimal concentration of HCl was 5 wt%, resulting in the highest sugar recovery of 85.98% from oak sawdust when treated at 130 °C for 2 h. The production of bioethanol (BE) by Pichia stipitis using the hydrolysates treated with 5% HCl and enzymes, supplemented with N-sources, demonstrated efficient productivity compared to the control group. To achieve a virtuous cycle, two residues from the dechlorination of PVC and saccharification of oak sawdust were pyrolyzed in a carbon dioxide (CO2) environment. The generation of carbon monoxide (CO) was significantly enhanced by the homogeneous reaction between CO2 and volatiles. This homogeneous reaction led to the modification of the compositional matrix in the oil. The generation of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons in oil was observed under CO2 conditions. To impart high reactivity to CO2, the catalytic pyrolysis of the residues was performed in the presence of Ni/SiO2. Indeed, the CO2 reactivity was catalytically enhanced, which greatly expedited the redox kinetics underlying the chemical reactions of CO2 with volatiles from PVC. The experimental findings provide a great avenue for hybridizing the thermochemical process of PVC and the biological bioethanol production process of lignocellulosic biomass. Such efforts are promising from the perspective of economic viability in the waste-to-energy and biofuel fields.
