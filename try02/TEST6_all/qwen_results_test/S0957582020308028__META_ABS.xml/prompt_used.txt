You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of biochar catalyst from black liquor by spray drying and fluidized bed carbonation for biodiesel synthesis Lab-scale experiments were carried out to investigate a new approach of preparing biochar-based catalyst for transesterification reaction. Black liquor (BL) from cotton pulping process was used as a precursor for preparing the catalyst via spray drying followed by fast carbonization in a fluidized bed reactor. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to statistically analyze and optimize the entire process of catalytic synthesis of biodiesel from a waste frying oil, consisted of the catalyst preparation and transesterification steps. Several major operation parameters of the biodiesel synthesis process, including alkaline loading in biochar, methanol to oil ratio, catalyst loading, and the carbonization temperature of catalyst, were studied for their effects on biodiesel conversion. The optimal condition for achieving the maximum biodiesel conversion (i.e. 91.5 %) was found to be: 27wt% alkaline loading in biochar, 600°C carbonization temperature, 7.7 methanol to oil ratio, and 6.5wt% catalyst loading. Overall, the spry drying fluidized bed carbonization demonstrated its viability for significantly reducing duration of high temperature carbonization, opening up the prospects of manufacturing the catalyst in a much less energy consumption manor.
