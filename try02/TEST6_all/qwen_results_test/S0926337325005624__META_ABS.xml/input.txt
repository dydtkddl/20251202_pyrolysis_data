Pyridinic nitrogen-modulated carbon nanotubes facilitate dual-electron transfer for polymerization-enhanced pollutant removal This study explores the regulation of polymerization-driven pollutant degradation through electronic structure modulation of carbon-based catalysts. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) with tunable pyridinic N content were synthesized by varying N precursors and applied in peroxydisulfate (PDS)-activated systems to evaluate their direct oxidative transfer process (DOTP) pathway performance. The N-CNT with the highest pyridinic N content (65.1 %) achieved nearly 100 % phenol (PhOH) removal with a rate constant (Kobs) of 0.23 min−1, 3.8 times higher than pristine CNTs, along with 90.0 % DOTP contribution and a 250 % increase in PDS utilization. Mechanistic analysis revealed that pyridinic N induced polarized electron density, enhanced dipole-driven pollutant adsorption, and significantly lowered the activation energy of the dual-electron transfer DOTP pathway. This work establishes an effective strategy for enhancing polymerization-based degradation via electronic modulation, offering new theoretical and technological insights for the development of efficient and low-carbon water treatment catalysts.
