You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Twin reactor catalytic assisted pyrolysis for food court waste conversion into high end chemicals Waste generation is growing every day and its disposal presents multiple challenges. One particular type of waste consists of food court waste (FCW) from food areas in malls. Its disposal requires many stages, starting with transportation, continuing with sorting and recycling, and ending with landfilling or combustion. Thus, this study managed to convert FCW into valuable products, disposing of it at the same time in an environmentally friendly way. For this ex situ catalytic pyrolysis process, experiments were performed by passing products from pyrolysis performed at 500 °C through HZSM5 or MeHZSM5 catalyst (Me = Co, Mo) kept at 300, 350 or 400 °C. The upgraded oil contained levoglucosan as main component when HZSM5 catalyst was used, regardless of the catalyst temperature, whereas when CoHZSM5 or MoHZSM5 catalysts were used, the levoglucosan formation was inhibited, with formation of ethylene glycol monoacetate as main component in the produced oil. The best performing catalyst for ethylene glycol monoacetate formation (∼80 % of bio-oil) proved to be MoHZSM5 at 350 °C. Therefore, our study managed address several issues simultaneously: a) costs cuts due to lack of sorting and processing; b) production of important chemicals from waste; c) waste disposal in an environmentally friendly way.
