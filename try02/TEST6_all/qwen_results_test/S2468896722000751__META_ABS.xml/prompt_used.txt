You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Very high cycle fatigue at elevated temperatures: A review on high temperature ultrasonic fatigue Since aviation sector equipment has evolved to very long-life application conditions, critical components and structures are regularly subjected to complex environments and applied stresses in service, which are more prone to cause failure and fracture. That is, various fatigue-critical components (e.g., jet engine parts that are under high-speed vibration) are exposed to a very large number of loading cycles (beyond 10 million) in a very harsh environment (elevated temperature). To closely resemble real (service) conditions for these types of applications, one needs to study non-ambient temperature ultralong life fatigue and assess the controlling mechanisms of crack initiation, relative to the ambient temperature testing, and the associated high-temperature phenomena (e.g., oxidations, recrystallizations, softening, etc.). However, low-/medium-frequency conventional fatigue testing is not practical to conduct very high cycle fatigue experiments (e.g., with a 10 Hz cyclic frequency, it would take 3 years to complete 109 cycles). This state-of-the-are review article aims at assessing the coupling effect of very high cycle fatigue loading and temperature in the ultra-long life fatigue regime (i.e., temperature-dependent very high cycle fatigue response). In other words, this review article provides details for conducting high-temperature very high cycle fatigue experiments by using ultrasonic fatigue testers equipped with the heating module (a high-frequency inductor). Moreover, the principles of VHCF specimen design at elevated temperatures and the challenges of high-temperature oxidation of the test specimen are provided in this review paper. This paper starts with a general introduction on non-ambient temperature very high cycle fatigue, then continuous with elevated temperature ultrasonic fatigue testing and very high cycle fatigue of various metallic materials including conventionally and additively manufactured ones.
