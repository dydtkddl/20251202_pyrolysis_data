You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanisms of polystyrene microplastic degradation by the microbially driven Fenton reaction Natural hydroxyl radical (·OH) production, which partially occurs through the microbially driven Fenton reaction, can enhance the degradation of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs). However, ·OH causes damage to microorganisms, which might in turn restrain the microbially driven Fenton reaction. Thus, whether PS-MPs can be continuously degraded by the microbially driven Fenton reaction and how they are degraded are still unknown. A pure-culture system using Shewanella putrefaciens 200 was set up to explore the effect and mechanism of microbially driven Fenton reaction on PS-MP degradation. In a 14-day operation, ·OH produced by the microbially driven Fenton reaction could degrade PS-MPs with a weight loss of 6.1 ± 0.6% and an O/C ratio of 0.6 (v.s. 0.6 ± 0.1% and 0.1, respectively, in the ·OH quenched group). Benzene ring derivatives such as 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-1-heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were the main soluble products of PS-MP degradation. The ·OH-induced oxidative damage on microorganisms did not affect ·OH production significantly when there was timely replenishment of organic carbon sources to promote reproduction of microorganisms. Thus, PS-MPs can be continuously degraded by microbially driven Fenton reactions in natural alternating anaerobic-aerobic environments. This study also provides a new microbial technique for MP degradation that is different from previous technologies based on microbial plastic-degrading enzymes.
