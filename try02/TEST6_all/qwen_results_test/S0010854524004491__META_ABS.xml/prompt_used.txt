You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress of NiFe2O4 electrode materials in supercapacitors: Preparation, modification, structural regulation, and future challenges Supercapacitors have attracted extensive research attention in the fields of materials science, new devices, and new energy due to their better temperature characteristics, rapid charge-discharge rates, environmental friendliness, and ultra-long cycle life. NiFe2O4, as a pseudocapacitive electrode material with a spinel structure, has shown enormous potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to its low cost, high abundance, and better electrochemical performance. This paper systematically reviews various preparation methods of NiFe2O4 electrode materials, including but not limited to hydrothermal method, solvothermal method, electrospinning technique, sol-gel method, chemical bath deposition (CBD), co-precipitation method, and continuous ion layer adsorption reaction. Strategies for carbon material modification of NiFe2O4 electrodes using graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes, porous carbon, and activated carbon are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on structural regulation methods of NiFe2O4 and its composite materials, comprehensively analyzing different structural design strategies such as heterojunction structure, core-shell structure, hollow structure, dendritic structure, and layered structure, and their effects on material performance. In particular, a detailed analysis of the pore size distribution and specific surface area (SSA) characteristics of porous materials is conducted, and the specific impact mechanisms of pore size and SSA on electrochemical performance are summarized. The paper also focuses on the latest research progress in preparing asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) using NiFe2O4 electrode materials and comprehensively discusses the challenges faced by NiFe2O4 electrode materials and possible future development directions. Through this series of comprehensive analyses, the aim is to provide a solid theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the application of NiFe2O4 electrode materials in the field of supercapacitors.
