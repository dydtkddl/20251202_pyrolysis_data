High density polyethylene thermal pyrolysis: Kinetic and volatilization modeling High-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most widely used plastics, holds immense potential for chemical recycling. However, accurately capturing its complex degradation behavior remains a key challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that integrates kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, accounting for both melt-phase and gas-phase kinetics at a fundamental level, with vapor-liquid equilibrium models based on Peng-Robinson and PC-SAFT equations of state. This integrated framework captures the intricate dynamics of HDPE pyrolysis and enables detailed product characterization. The study’s predictions were validated through micro-pyrolyzer experiments at 550, 600, and 650 °C, using cutting-edge two-dimensional gas chromatography (2D-GC). Conversion profiles were validated using time-resolved experiments conducted at 450 and 500 °C. We also explore how pressure affects the product distribution, how reaction rates differ between the gas and melt phases, and the pivotal role of gas residence time. This innovative approach deepens our understanding of HDPE degradation and lays the groundwork for more efficient and scalable recycling technologies, bringing us closer to a sustainable future.
