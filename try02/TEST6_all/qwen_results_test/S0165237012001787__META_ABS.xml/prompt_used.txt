You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal processing of plastics from waste electrical and electronic equipment for hydrogen production Plastic waste from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) produced from a real-world commercial WEEE recycling centre has been processed using pyrolysis–gasification using a two-stage reaction system to produce hydrogen. In the first stage, the plastic fraction was pyrolysed at 600°C and the evolved pyrolysis gases were passed directly to a second reactor at 800°C and reacted with steam in the presence of a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) which were the main components of the WEEE plastic were reacted to compare with the WEEE plastic. The results showed that the introduction of steam and the catalyst increased the yield of hydrogen. Increasing the nickel content in the catalyst also resulted in higher hydrogen yield. The comparison of the results of WEEE with those of HIPS and ABS showed that WEEE plastic was mainly composed of ABS. The catalyst, after reaction, showed significant deposition of coke composed of filamentous and layered type carbon. Overall the novel processing of waste plastic from electrical and electronic equipment using a two stage pyrolysis–gasification reactor shows great promise for the production of hydrogen.
