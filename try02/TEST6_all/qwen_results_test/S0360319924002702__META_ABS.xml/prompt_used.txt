You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Confined ammonia borane nanocarriers: Tubular and fibrous structures based solid-state hydrogen storage composites This paper introduces a confinement approach to enhance solid-state hydrogen storage by designing a nano-tubular and nano-fibrous structured boron-based storage medium. We detail the preparation of the confinement matrix, emphasizing its nanotubular and microfibrous structures provided by activated halloysite and sepiolite clays to achieve suitable confinement for ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB). The thermolysis characteristics are thoroughly investigated in a lab-scale hydrogen reactor, elucidating the activation effects (thermal, acid, and both thermal-acid) on confinement and hydrogen generation performance. The resulting composite exhibits improved thermal stability and controlled hydrogen desorption characteristics, offering great promise for safe and efficient hydrogen storage applications. This research underscores the potential of tailored nanomaterials in advancing hydrogen storage technologies, with significant implications for clean energy solutions and the sustainable transportation sector. AB confined in acid-activated nano-tubular clay has shown improved hydrogen generation features at 120 °C, resulting in the highest improvement in H2 equivalent per AB mole (98 %) and the initial hydrogen generation rate (233 %) while minimizing induction time up to 90 %.
