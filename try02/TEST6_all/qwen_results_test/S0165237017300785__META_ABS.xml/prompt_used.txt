You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structure-reactivity relationship in pyrolysis of plastics: A comparison with natural polymers Recent advances in plastics recycling confirm the high potential of pyrolysis technologies to enhance recovery and selectivity rates. Modelling the kinetics of this complex process to stimulate scaling-up opportunities remains a major challenge.This study is an attempt to develop practical quantitative reactivity indices for the pyrolysis of natural and synthetic polymers. Representative samples from both categories (coal and pine vs. PET, PE and PMMA) were selected. Their weight loss during pyrolysis was determined experimentally and analyzed using judicious lumping procedures for its initiation, propagation and termination steps. The combined experimental and theoretical approach allowed us to determine apparent activation energies using the isoconversional Friedman method; and the use of Benson’s group contribution method generated reaction enthalpies for the initiation reactions. Increasing activation energies with conversion in each case indicated that bond scission proceeds in order of increasing bond strength. The greater chemical complexity of natural polymers was reflected in the higher coefficients of variability for activation energy and wider ranges of reaction enthalpies. A structure-reactivity relationship based on the Evans-Polanyi theory was used to test the hypothesis that primary pyrolysis kinetics is controlled by cleavage of weakest chemical bonds. While the results show that this approach is promising, especially if confirmed by extension to a larger data set, they also suggest the need to compare the relative kinetic importance of initiation and propagation steps in the sequence of polymer pyrolysis reactions.
