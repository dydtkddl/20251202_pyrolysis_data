You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced microplastics removal from sewage effluents via CTAB-modified magnetic biochar: Efficacy and environmental impact Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are identified as a significant pathway of microplastics (MPs) re-entry into the environment through effluent discharge, thereby emphasizing the need for reliable and efficient treatment methods. This study investigated MPs removal from sewage effluents using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-modified magnetic biochar (RH-MBC-CTAB) as an adsorbent. Biochars from different biomass were synthesized, surface modified, characterized, and compared for their MPs removal efficacy from aqueous matrices. Batch adsorption studies were initially conducted on synthetic water with 1 μm sized polystyrene (PS) MPs using different MP concentrations (1–10 mg/L) and varying adsorbent dosages (1–10 mg/50 mL) to assess the effect of different process parameters, viz. pH (2–10), humic acid (6–25 mg/L), and competitive ions (0.01–0.2 M). The maximum MPs removal (98%) was achieved at the favorable conditions: initial MPs concentration: 10 mg/L, RH-MBC-CTAB dose: 7 mg/50 mL, pH 4, mixing speed: 180 rpm, and contact time: 3 min. Electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding were likely to remove MPs while the MPs adsorption was best fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R 2 = 0.91) and Langmuir isotherm model (R 2 = 0.94) with the maximum adsorption capacity of 247.52 mg/g. Further, the application of RH-MBC-CTAB on the real-time sewage effluents from sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)-based STPs spiked with MPs showed up to 96% MPs removal. The reusability results revealed that developed RH-MBC-CTAB could maintain good stability for up to three reusability cycles, therefore offering extensive potential for the removal of MPs from sewage effluents.
