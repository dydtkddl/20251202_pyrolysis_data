You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorisation of waste biomass and plastics toward light aromatics: Co-catalytic fast pyrolysis of torrefied bamboo and polyethylene over alkali and acid treated hierarchical HZSM-5 Light aromatics are extremely important building blocks which can be prepared from the co-catalytic fast pyrolysis (Co-CFP) of biomass and polyethylene. In this study, the bamboo was torrefied to remove part of oxygen element prior to pyrolysis, then being co-fed with polyethylene (HDPE, PE and LDPE) during CFP over alkali (NaOH and Na2CO3) and acid (H3PO4 and HCl) treated HZSM-5. 40.3% oxygen element in bamboo could be eliminated at torrefaction temperature of 300 °C. After the acid dealumination or alkali desilication treatments, the mesopore was creased in HZSM-5, transforming into hierarchical structure with larger pore size and lower acidity. The effect of torrefaction temperature, the species of alkali or acid solutions and their concentrations, the mass ratio of HDPE-to-torrefied bamboo, the CFP temperature on the yields of light aromatics was systematically discussed. The maximum yield of BTX was 4.39 × 108 a.u./mg which was obtained by Co-CFP of torrefied bamboo (250 °C) and HDPE at mass ratio of 1:2 with 800 °C over 0.2 M NaOH treated hierarchical HZSM-5. The aromatization reaction of olefins, the deoxygenation reaction of oxygenates, and the Diels-Alder reaction between furans and olefins were key reactions for the formation of BTX during Co-CFP of torrefied bamboo and polyethylene.
