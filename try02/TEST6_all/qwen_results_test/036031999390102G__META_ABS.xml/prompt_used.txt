You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

ICAR process (immediate catalytic accumulation of ionizing radiation energy) as a new promising approach to the development of cheminuclear power plants A new thermocatalytic method, ICAR, for nuclear-to-chemical energy conversion is suggested. The method is based on a combination of both nuclear and catalytic reactors in the same technological volume, by loading the catalyst directly into the active (energy releasing) zone of a nuclear reactor. Two variations of the suggested method are studied, based on the endothermic catalytic reactions of methane- and methanol - steam reforming as well as on ammonia decomposition. The conditions of intensive heat release immediately inside the catalyst bed were simulated by means of an electron accelerator. A new type of uranium-containing catalyst for steam reforming of methane was synthesized and studied. These special catalysts, as well as conventional commercial catalysts being used in the ICAR method were shown to be capable of ensuring a considerable intensification of the energy-accumulating chemical reaction and of increasing the specific power loading of the energy conversion up to 100–150 kW dm−3. The results of mathematical simulation of direct thermochemical conversion of radiation (nuclear) energy are also presented. Some advantages of the ICAR method and expected difficulties of its practical application are discussed here in order to point out some problems that should be solved in the near future.
