ICAR process (immediate catalytic accumulation of ionizing radiation energy) as a new promising approach to the development of cheminuclear power plants A new thermocatalytic method, ICAR, for nuclear-to-chemical energy conversion is suggested. The method is based on a combination of both nuclear and catalytic reactors in the same technological volume, by loading the catalyst directly into the active (energy releasing) zone of a nuclear reactor. Two variations of the suggested method are studied, based on the endothermic catalytic reactions of methane- and methanol - steam reforming as well as on ammonia decomposition. The conditions of intensive heat release immediately inside the catalyst bed were simulated by means of an electron accelerator. A new type of uranium-containing catalyst for steam reforming of methane was synthesized and studied. These special catalysts, as well as conventional commercial catalysts being used in the ICAR method were shown to be capable of ensuring a considerable intensification of the energy-accumulating chemical reaction and of increasing the specific power loading of the energy conversion up to 100–150 kW dm−3. The results of mathematical simulation of direct thermochemical conversion of radiation (nuclear) energy are also presented. Some advantages of the ICAR method and expected difficulties of its practical application are discussed here in order to point out some problems that should be solved in the near future.
