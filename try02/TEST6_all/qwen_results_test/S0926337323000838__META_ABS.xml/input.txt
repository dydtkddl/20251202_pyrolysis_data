Long-lasting performance of high-flux perovskite membrane for catalytic degradation of organic pollutants Membrane separation for wastewater remediation has been perplexed by membrane fouling, and the design of highly antifouling membranes for high-flux operation remains challenging. Herein, Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ (SSC700) membrane was coupled with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalysis. SSC700 demonstrated superb efficacy in batch and fixed-bed reactions, generating sulfate radicals (SO4 −•) and hydroxyl radicals (HO•) for pollutants oxidation. Additionally, in robust SSC700 membrane/PMS systems, Rhodamine B (RhB) realized > 91% removal for 50 h from laboratory wastewater under fluxes above 368 L/(m2·h), and strikingly, ciprofloxacin, RhB and sulfamerazine in the secondary effluent attained 60–80% (50 h), almost 100% (100 h) and 50–60% (50 h) removal under fluxes around 1000, 600 and 900 L/(m2·h), respectively. The highly reactive Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ redox couples accounted for the prominent activity, stability and antifouling capability of SSC700 membranes. Apart from Co species, Sm/Sr played significant roles in organics degradation. Also, bio-toxicity evolution during ciprofloxacin mineralization was monitored. This study dedicates to the design of functional membranes/PMS integrated systems for synergistic wastewater decontamination and membrane defouling.
