You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interplay of surface oxygen content and pore water during thermal regeneration of granular activated carbons This study aims at unraveling the interplay between thermal regeneration and granular activated carbon (GAC) properties. First, twelve commercially available, unused, and thoroughly characterized GACs were pyrolyzed without per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) using a thermogravimetric analyzer at a 25 ºC/min heating rate up to 750 ºC under nitrogen. GACs with elevated oxygen content showed substantial weight loss due to the decomposition of acidic functional groups, leading to the formation of larger pores but a decrease in specific surface area and physical hardness. Additionally, pore water capacity of GAC influenced the regeneration, as water molecules sorbed to surface oxygenated groups via hydrogen bonding contributed to the formation of carboxylic acids and subsequent decomposition. Next, PFAS destruction mechanism during regeneration was demonstrated by loading GAC with perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Gaseous product analysis showed a catalytic effect for PFOS-laden GAC, where hydrogen fluoride formation occurred at 50 ºC lower temperatures than in pure PFOS, indicating improved PFOS thermolysis when adsorbed by GAC. This catalytic effect is likely due to chemical interactions between PFOS and the delocalized electrons on the GAC surface, warranting further investigation. The diverse GAC responses during regeneration underscore the importance of understanding regeneration conditions to maintain GAC functionality while enhancing PFAS treatment sustainability.
