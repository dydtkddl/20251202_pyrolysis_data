Comprehensive review on recent progress in renewable and sustainable energy applications in shipping industry, and suggestions for future developments Current trends in maritime technology are mainly focused on construction and operation of eco-friendly ships to achieve “Net zero by 2050”. Accordingly, various low-emission technologies are being introduced in shipbuilding. This review introduces various renewable and sustainable energy sources applicable to ships. These include solar, wind, wave, nuclear, and vibration energies; fuel cells; batteries; supercapacitors; flow batteries; and flywheels. The basic principles and application systems of each of these energy sources are explained. International laws, international standards, and other information and guidance sources are presented in an organized manner. We discuss efficiency enhancement, key considerations, safety information, benefits, and challenges. Furthermore, we introduce ships equipped with renewable and sustainable energy sources. Finally, some future suggestions, based on our critical analysis are put forth.
