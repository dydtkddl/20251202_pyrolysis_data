You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of fiber type on enteric methane production from growing-finishing pigs and subsequent biochemical methane potential of excreted feces Three diets differing in type and amount of total fiber (TF) were formulated in order to investigate the effects of fiber type and amount on enteric methane (CH4) production from growing-finishing pigs and subsequent biochemical CH4 potential of the excreted feces. The experimental diets consisted of a control diet based on wheat, barley, and soybean meal, a diet with high content of insoluble TF based on wheat bran (WB), and a diet with high content of soluble TF based on sugar beet pulp (SBP). Eighteen female growing-finishing pigs were allocated to one of three experimental diets according to a replicated incomplete 3 * 2 Latin square design. After adaptation to the diet and metabolic cages, urine and feces samples were collected for 4 days, including 48 hours of gas exchange measurements in respiration chambers. Excreted feces were collected when pigs weighed 64.8 ± 3.8 kg and 89.7 ± 4.4 kg to determine the biochemical CH4 potential (BMP) of the feces in batch experiments. The enteric CH4 production expressed per TF intake was affected by the type of TF, with the lowest CH4 production obtained when pigs were fed a WB diet (P < 0.02). However, the decreased methanogenesis in the hindgut of the pigs was counteracted by the increased BMP90 of the feces. On the other hand, although feeding pigs with an SBP diet resulted in the highest enteric CH4 production, the CH4 derived from feces also remained high. In conclusion, the fiber type alters the methanogenesis in the hindgut of pigs and the subsequent BMP90 of the feces, and, therefore, needs to be considered during diet formulation in the context of minimizing enteric CH4 production and maximizing the BMP90 of the feces.
