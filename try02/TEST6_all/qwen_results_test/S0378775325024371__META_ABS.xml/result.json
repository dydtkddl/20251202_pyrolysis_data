  "pyrolysis_related": "YES",
  "reason": "The study involves pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to produce reduced graphene oxide, with measurable product performance (specific capacitance, energy density, cycling stability) and experimental conditions (nanoclay catalyst, melt mixing, pyrolysis process)."
