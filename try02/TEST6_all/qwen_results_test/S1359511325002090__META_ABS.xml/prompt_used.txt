You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a flow microreactor with immobilized catechol-1,2-dioxygenase for the biocatalytic production of cis,cis-muconic acid A low cost microreactor was developed by stable immobilization of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase for the flow biocatalysis of catechol to produce cis,cis-muconic acid, a direct precursor of industrially relevant adipic acid. The microreactors of polydimethylsiloxane were manufactured with different designs by straightforward, cost-effective soft lithography techniques, and were tested with different immobilization strategies focused on preserving enzyme catalytic activity and stability over time. The best immobilization strategy was covalent immobilization by amino-silanization followed by glutaraldehyde linker grafting. The biocatalytic activity of the immobilized enzyme was assessed by measuring muconic acid production through the flow of 50 µM catechol at room temperature. Catechol conversion rates of up to 95 % were achieved over a 5-hour period, and volumes of up to 180 mL were processed using only 0.32 nmol of immobilized protein, resulting in the production of 1.33 mg·L−1·h−1. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using microreactor-based flow biocatalysis for sustainable muconic acid production and highlights its promising application at industrial scale.
