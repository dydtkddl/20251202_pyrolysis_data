You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation of a new biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) power generation system using Aspen Plus: Performance analysis and energetic assessment A new biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC), which featured an innovative two-stage enriched air gasification system coupling a fluidized bed with a swirl-melting furnace, was proposed and built for clean and efficient biomass utilization. The performance of biomass gasification and power generation under various operating conditions was assessed using a comprehensive Aspen Plus model for system optimization. The model was validated by pilot-scale experimental data and gas turbine regulations, showing good agreement. Parameters including oxygen percentage of enriched air (OP), gasification temperature, excess air ratio and compressor pressure ratio were studied for BIGCC optimization. Results showed that increase OP could effectively improve syngas quality and two-stage gasification efficiency, enhancing the gas turbine inlet and outlet temperature. The maximum BIGCC fuel utilization efficiency could be obtained at OP of 40%. Increasing gasification temperature showed a negative effect on the two-stage gasification performance. For efficient BIGCC operation, the excess air ratio should be below 3.5 to maintain a designed gas turbine inlet temperature. Modest increase of compressor pressure ratio favored the power generation. Finally, the BIGCC energy analysis further proved the rationality of system design and sufficient utilization of biomass energy.
