Simulation of a new biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) power generation system using Aspen Plus: Performance analysis and energetic assessment A new biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC), which featured an innovative two-stage enriched air gasification system coupling a fluidized bed with a swirl-melting furnace, was proposed and built for clean and efficient biomass utilization. The performance of biomass gasification and power generation under various operating conditions was assessed using a comprehensive Aspen Plus model for system optimization. The model was validated by pilot-scale experimental data and gas turbine regulations, showing good agreement. Parameters including oxygen percentage of enriched air (OP), gasification temperature, excess air ratio and compressor pressure ratio were studied for BIGCC optimization. Results showed that increase OP could effectively improve syngas quality and two-stage gasification efficiency, enhancing the gas turbine inlet and outlet temperature. The maximum BIGCC fuel utilization efficiency could be obtained at OP of 40%. Increasing gasification temperature showed a negative effect on the two-stage gasification performance. For efficient BIGCC operation, the excess air ratio should be below 3.5 to maintain a designed gas turbine inlet temperature. Modest increase of compressor pressure ratio favored the power generation. Finally, the BIGCC energy analysis further proved the rationality of system design and sufficient utilization of biomass energy.
