You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Box Behnken design application for optimization of bio-oil yield from catalytic pyrolysis of agro-residue A Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the effect of reaction temperature and biomass to catalyst (b/c) ratio on the catalytic pyrolysis of three wood sawdust samples in a fixed bed reactor using Green zeolite-Y catalyst synthesized from Ficus exasperate (L.) leaf particles. Temperature (400–700 °C), biomass percentage (60–100%), and catalyst (0–40%) were the independent variables with a total of 15 experimental runs, including 3 center runs, were generated via the Box-Behnken experimental design. The results reveal that biomass/ catalyst (b/c) ratio of 80/20% at 550 °C yielded optimum pyrolytic liquid for Melicia excelsa (Me), Diospyros crassiflora (Dc) and Entada Africana (Ea) as 31 wt.%, 31 wt.%, 30 wt.%, respectively while with the attendance of catalysts at 20% increased the yield of pyrolytic liquid for Me (45 wt.%), Dc (42 wt.%), and Ea (43 wt.%). GCMS analysis of Me (80.81 wt.%), Dc (73.96 wt.%), and Ea (70.26 wt.%) pyrolytic oil reveals the dominance of phenols, ethers, alcohols, ketones, alkanes, and acids. Reduction in acidity, decrease in oxygen content, increase in viscosity of the bio-oil were noticed in biomass/catalyst (b/c) ratio of 80/20 at 550 °C. These measurements show enhanced pyrolysis oil characteristics, which is a boost to its bioenergy potential.
