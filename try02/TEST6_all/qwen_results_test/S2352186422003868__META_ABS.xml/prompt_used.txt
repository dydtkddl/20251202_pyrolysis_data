You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hybrid valorization of biodiesel production using sustainable mixed alcohol solvent The growing global need for energy has resulted in a rise of interest in renewable energy-based fuels such as biodiesel. Palm oil mill effluent, a waste that is produced in large quantities, was used for biodiesel production. 90% of residual palm oil was successfully recovered from the effluent of palm oil mills at extraction conditions of mixing speed of 500 rpm and mixing duration of 25 min. The extracted oil was used to produce biodiesel under the influence of semi-batch heating. Aspen plus simulation model was also developed to compare the performance with the experimental findings. The influence of four process parameters includes reaction temperature of 30–70 °C, time of reaction 1–5 h, solvent to oil mole ratio of 3–15 and catalyst amount of 0.5–2.5%. The optimized experimental and simulated biodiesel yield of 94.73% and 92.83% at the operating conditions of reaction temperature of 60 °C, a reaction time of 4 h, alcohol to oil molar ratio of 12:1 and 2% catalyst concentration. The agreement between predicted and actual biodiesel yield was found to be 98%. The coefficients of estimates of 22.88, 27.29, 32.24 and 22.86 were calculated by the quadratic model for alcohol/oil molar ratio, reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst loading respectively. The study showed a higher biodiesel yield (94.73%) by using the solution of methanol and ethanol for biodiesel synthesis. Therefore, RPO could possibly result in cheaper biodiesel synthesis and can contribute to make up the energy needs if implemented on an industrial scale.
