You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluating the kinetic triplet parameters, mechanisms, and thermodynamics involved in the pyrolysis of Chamaerops humilis waste cellulosic fibers to produce sustainable and renewable biofuels Biomass has become a promising renewable energy source, driven by the decreasing supply of fossil fuels and ongoing environmental problems related to their use. Understanding biomass pyrolysis characteristics is essential, as it offers valuable insights and guidance for developing and improving the pyrolysis process. A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere was conducted to examine the pyrolysis features and kinetic parameters of Chamaerops humilis fibers (ChFs). The temperature range was from 20 to 800 °C, with heating rates (β) of 30, 40, and 50 °C·min⁻¹ . The kinetic and thermodynamic properties, chemical reactions, and thermal degradation behaviors of ChFs were studied using TGA and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which was applied to analyze the functional groups in the raw biomass before pyrolysis. Thirty-six kinetic models for four key solid-phase reaction steps were tested using the Coats-Redfern method. The reaction model's pre-exponential factor (A), ranging from 7.46 to 7.64 for all heating rates, was identified as the best fit, assuming random nucleation and its subsequent growth g(α)= \[−ln(1 −α) ⁴]. Activation energy (E a ) values of 218.87, 230.49, and 252.73 kJ·mol⁻¹ were obtained at 30, 40, and 50 °C·min⁻¹ , respectively. These kinetic parameters were used to calculate thermodynamic properties, including the enthalpy change (ΔH), Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), and entropy change (ΔS). The thermodynamic data suggest that ChF's pyrolysis is an endothermic process that lacks spontaneity.
