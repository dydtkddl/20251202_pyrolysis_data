You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polymer-based biochar materials for environmental remediation: A review The prodigious consumption of an extensive array of plastic products have engendered an enormous amount of plastic wastes. Incineration of waste plastic in the open atmosphere serves to be one of the predominant sources of air pollution, due to the liberation of various noxious gases like Polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, dioxins, and furans into the atmosphere. Conversion of the generated waste plastics into biochar serves to address dual concerns associated with mitigating plastic pollution concerns, while also opening up avenues for extensive environmental remediation applications. The synthesis of biochar, a carbonaceous substance possessing greater specific surface area, porosity, total pore volume, and abundant surface functionalities obtained by the thermochemical conversion of waste plastic distinctively, along with mixtures containing biomass feedstock can be utilized for as an adsorbent for the elimination of toxic gases from the atmosphere, while also being applicable for effluent treatment. In this regard, the present review is the first that analytically contemplates the conversion of pristine plastic wastes via pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization, and plastic wastes mixed with other biomass feedstock via co-pyrolysis, and co-hydrothermal carbonization techniques, and activated plastic-derived char modified by physical, or chemical methodologies to adsorb an extensive array of detrimental contaminants spanning from dyes, heavy metal ions, pharmaceutical compounds, and other organic compounds from wastewater, while also capturing toxic gases from the atmosphere. Various adsorption advanced characterization methodologies, kinetics models, isotherm models, and underlying mechanism governing the sorption of these pollutants are also accentuated in this review. Furthermore, the prospects of regenerability of the spent plastic char adsorbents along with a roadmap leading to the future directives in this domain for heading towards a green, and sustainable environment are also presented here.
