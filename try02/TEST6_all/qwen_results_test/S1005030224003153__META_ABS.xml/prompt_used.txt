You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of flame retardant polymers: Current technologies and future perspectives Polymers are indispensable to humans in different applications due to their ease of manufacturing and overall performance. However, after a material lifetime, there is a large amount of polymer-based waste, which greatly contributes to the loss of valuable resources and environmental pollution. Thermoplastics may be readily recycled, but because of their flammability, large amounts of flame retardant (FR) additives are required for many applications. This results in a significant volume of FR polymeric wastes too, particularly halogenated plastics, which are subject to severe recycling regulations. In general, thermoplastics containing FRs are raising concerns, as their effective recycling is strongly influenced by the chemical composition, additive content, and physicochemical characteristics of the waste stream. The recycling of FR thermosets is even more challenging due to their crosslinked and cured nature, which makes them resistant to melting and reprocessing. In many cases, traditional mechanical recycling methods, such as grinding and melting, are not applicable to thermosetting polymers. Current recycling methods do not always consider the recovery of the thermosetting/thermoplastic matrix and the presence of toxic FRs in the polymer network. Sorting and solvent washing treatment are important steps, which are usually performed before recycling the FR polymeric waste to reduce contamination in the following steps. Considering all the technical difficulties during recycling, the high cost of sorting and solvent washing, and the increasing demand for more sustainable procedures, the scientific community is fostering the transformation toward more feasible and energy-efficient recycling strategies. Also, many directives are imposing strict disposal and sorting rules, limiting the use of FR halogen-based compounds, and promoting the commercialization of more recyclable polymers. This review aims to provide a general overview of currently applied approaches for recycling FR thermoplastics and thermosets, and possible approaches for designing the next generation of FR polymer-based materials. The existing recycling strategies for FR polymers are summarized. Developments in the manufacturing of covalent adaptable networks as an outlook towards circularity in polymers are also addressed in this review.
