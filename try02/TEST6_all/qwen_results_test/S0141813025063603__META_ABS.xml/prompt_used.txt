You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into recent advancements and future prospects of carrageenan-based biodegradable film from marine red algae: A review The sulphated polysaccharides extracted from seaweeds are considered to be a promising natural biopolymer for various applications. Due to its inherent gelling properties and high thermal stability, sulphated polysaccharides (carrageenan) are getting more attention for the preparation and development of biodegradable films. This article's goal is to provide a thorough analysis of current advancements in carrageenan-based films, including manufacturing techniques, physical and chemical characteristics, innovative food packaging and other applications. Combining various extraction techniques will be the future trend in the extraction of high yielding carrageenan. Carrageenan can create uniform film-forming solutions and produce films primarily through direct coating, solvent casting and electrospinning. The mechanism of film production and the selectivity of plasticizers in modulating mechanical as well as physico-chemical properties of biodegradable film is thoroughly discussed in this paper. Carrageenan-based films are receiving a lot of interest in food packaging applications as a potential solution to the major environmental issues that plastic-based packaging is causing. By preventing microbial development, lowering moisture loss and respiration, carrageenan-based films can be widely utilized to increase the shelf life of food and maintain its freshness. This review also delivers the future prospects and directions of carrageenan based biodegradable film in developing sustainable materials.
