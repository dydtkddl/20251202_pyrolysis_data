Insights into recent advancements and future prospects of carrageenan-based biodegradable film from marine red algae: A review The sulphated polysaccharides extracted from seaweeds are considered to be a promising natural biopolymer for various applications. Due to its inherent gelling properties and high thermal stability, sulphated polysaccharides (carrageenan) are getting more attention for the preparation and development of biodegradable films. This article's goal is to provide a thorough analysis of current advancements in carrageenan-based films, including manufacturing techniques, physical and chemical characteristics, innovative food packaging and other applications. Combining various extraction techniques will be the future trend in the extraction of high yielding carrageenan. Carrageenan can create uniform film-forming solutions and produce films primarily through direct coating, solvent casting and electrospinning. The mechanism of film production and the selectivity of plasticizers in modulating mechanical as well as physico-chemical properties of biodegradable film is thoroughly discussed in this paper. Carrageenan-based films are receiving a lot of interest in food packaging applications as a potential solution to the major environmental issues that plastic-based packaging is causing. By preventing microbial development, lowering moisture loss and respiration, carrageenan-based films can be widely utilized to increase the shelf life of food and maintain its freshness. This review also delivers the future prospects and directions of carrageenan based biodegradable film in developing sustainable materials.
