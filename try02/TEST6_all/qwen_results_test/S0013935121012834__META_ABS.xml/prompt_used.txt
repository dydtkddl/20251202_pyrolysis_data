You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sorption of arsenic by composts and biochars derived from the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes: Kinetic, isotherm and oral bioaccessibility study The historic contamination of water and soils by arsenic (As) is an extremely alarming environmental and public health issue worldwide. This study investigated the relationship between As sorption and physicochemical properties of composts and biochars derived from the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) towards the development of promising sorbents with value-added solid wastes management solutions. The sorbents were characterized and their effectiveness on the As sorption was tested. Several isothermal and kinetic sorption models were used for the prediction of sorption. Composts did not show promising sorption capacities, and in some cases, the As immobilization was practically null. In contrast, biochars achieved higher sorption performance, and the experimental data fitted well on Dubinin-Rabushkevich and Langmuir models, with higher R2 values. The maximum sorption capacities of BC700 estimated by such models were 6.495 and 170.252 mg g−1, respectively, whereas those of BC500 estimated by D-R and Langmuir models were only 0.066 and 0.070 mg g−1, respectively. In sorption kinetics, As was retained onto biochars at a faster first stage, reaching equilibrium after approximately 1 h and 2 h for initial concentrations of 10 and 100 mg L−1. The pseudo-second-order, Ritchie's second-order, Ritchie's, and Elovich models more adequately described the sorption kinetics of As onto biochars with high R2 values. Overall, the complexation and precipitation were predominant mechanisms for As sorption by OFMSW-derived biochars. Furthermore, the mathematical models indicated contributions arise from physisorption and external and internal diffusion mechanisms. Although BC700 can immobilize large As amounts, the gastric phase of the oral bioaccessibility test revealed more than 80% of the sorbed As could be released under conditions similar to a human stomach (pH~1.2). Such conclusions have given important insights about the refining of effective and eco-friendly remediation technologies for the management and rehabilitation of As-contaminated soil and water, particularly in developing countries.
