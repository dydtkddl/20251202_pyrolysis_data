You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From non-renewable waste to activated carbon: A smart move towards sustainable development and environmental protection in a circular economy Waste generation is unavoidable as the population grows and globalisation/modernisation occurs. Ineffective garbage management and treatment raise major environmental concerns. This study provides a comprehensive and unique compilation of available knowledge on the potential use of various non-renewable waste materials to produce activated carbon (AC). One document brings together and evaluates the potential for converting hazardous and non-hazardous waste – from industrial and municipal to recyclable and medical waste – into a valuable resource with wide-ranging applications. The appropriately selected conversion method is key to converting waste into a valuable activated carbon product. It must consider both the applicable legal regulations and the key technological parameters that determine the quality and suitability of the final product for a specific application. The numerous carbonisation and activation methods employed to convert waste to AC include hydrothermal, ionothermal, pyrolysis and microwave-assisted methods. AC’s elemental composition and functional groups are analysed using elemental analysis, XPS and FTIR. Crystal structure and phase identification are performed via XRD, SEM and TEM. Surface area and porosity are determined using the BET and BJH methods, along with the iodine index. Following the thermal conversion of various waste materials into AC, it is widely used in multiple disciplines, including energy and the environment. AC is used as an adsorbent to effectively remove harmful elements from water, including pharmaceutical contamination, dyes and heavy metals. AC has excellent electrochemical characteristics and is highly efficient in CO2 capture. AC also extracts valuable products such as hydrocarbons, methane and uranium.
