You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Elevated wet deposition of micro- and nanoplastics in remote mountains driven by free tropospheric transport Airborne Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) can reach the free troposphere (FT) and transport to remote regions, however, their wet deposition within FT remains unclear. Here, we investigated MNP wet deposition at a high-elevation site within the FT (1700 m a.s.l.) in a remote mountain reserve in southern China, and compared it with a low-altitude site (60 m a.s.l.) influenced by urban outflow. MNPs were identified and quantified by pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Pyr−GC/MS), resolving polymer types from diagnostic pyrolysates with external calibration to mass concentrations. Event-mean MNP concentrations in mountain rainwater averaged 22.0 ± 20.5 μg L−1, nearly three times higher than at the low-altitude site (7.8 ± 4.3 μg L−1), suggesting substantial MNP loads in the FT. Back-trajectory analysis identified dominant sources as regional transport from the Pearl River Delta and long-range transport from the Indochina Peninsula. Seasonal patterns showed that rainfall scavenging dominated in spring, while wind-driven FT transport prevailed in summer. MNP wet deposition averaged 54 μg m−2 event−1 (event-mean concentration × rainfall depth), with an annual rate of 13 kg km−2, totaling 7.4 metric tons per year in the mountain reserve. Our results indicate that the FT acts as both a transport pathway and a temporary reservoir for airborne MNPs, highlighting its role in the global fate of atmospheric plastic.
