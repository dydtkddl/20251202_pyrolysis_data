You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treatments of electric arc furnace dust and halogenated plastic wastes: A review This paper reviews the latest research findings on the combined treatment of both electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) and halogenated plastic wastes, mainly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame-retardants (BFRs). EAFD contains heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Fe, Cd, etc.); its disposal using the traditional landfilling method threatens the environment. On the other hand, halogenated plastic wastes accumulate annually at an alarming rate due to their excessive production, consumption, and disposal. PVC, for example, does not decompose naturally; it remains one of the most dangerous plastics, as it contains high proportions of chlorine that is responsible for hazardous emissions of chlorinated organic compounds (dioxins) and hydrochloric acid vapour. Recent research have focused on the combined treatment of PVC/BFRs and EAFD. HCl/HBr acids produced from the pyrolysis of PVC/BFRs can react with the metal oxides in the EAFD to convert them into readily separable metal halides. Alternatively, several researches illustrated the advantages of using additives such as metal oxides during the incineration treatment of waste PVC/BFRs to fix gaseous HCl/HBr, and consequently, EAFD would be considered an excellent and cheap candidate for PVC dechlorination, as well as dehalogenation of other halogenated plastics during thermal recycling processes. In this review we critically discuss literature findings on thermal treatment of PVC/BFR materials under oxidative and pyrolytic environments, typically at temperatures of 200–900 °C in presence of metal oxides or EAFD. We also discuss the treatment/disposal routes for both waste materials (EAFD and halogenated plastic wastes) and the environmental impact of these disposal options. The review, finally, proposes the research necessary to minimize the hazards of these waste materials; Several future research areas were identified including the need to study the behaviour of real EAFD-plastic waste mixtures under oxidative thermal conditions with focus on both the selective recovery of metals and identification, quantification, and minimization of halogenated organic compounds released during the combined thermal treatment.
