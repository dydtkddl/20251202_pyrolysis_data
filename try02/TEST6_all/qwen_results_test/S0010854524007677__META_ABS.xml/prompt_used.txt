You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flatland of Graphene's derivatives: Classification, synthesis, mechanisms, role of defects, applications, and prospectives This comprehensive review explores the fantasy flatland of derivatives of graphene composes of hydrogenated graphene, fluorinated graphene, oxidized graphene, graphyne, graphdiyne, graphane, graphone, graphene nanoplatelets, GQDs, graphene sponge, RGO, graphene nanoribbon, doped graphene, penta graphene, graphenylene, graphenyldiene, biphenylene, net-Graphene, graphene+, and T-graphene based nanoribbons, their history, synthesis strategies, mechanism, the pivotal role of defects that affect the quality of graphene's derivatives, as well as applications and prospects. The derivatives, spanning from hydrogenated and fluorinated graphene to doped graphene and graphenylene, exhibit distinct properties and applications. Our focus then moves to the synthesis techniques employed, providing insights into the methodologies shaping these derivatives. The subsequent analysis of defects, including point defects, vacancies, grain boundaries, and more, highlights the complexities influencing their characteristics. Moreover, we present a detailed review of defective morphologies of the derivatives of graphene using advanced spectroscopy techniques such as ultraviolet, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron, Raman, etc. Besides, this review also highlights their profound influence on material properties, defect consequence, and potential applications useful in different eras of life. These applications span diverse fields, including biosensors, artificial intelligence, military defense, solar energy, and water desalination. In addition, perspectives on the future trajectory of research in this dynamic field are provided, offering a roadmap for the research community to further unlock the potential of graphene derivatives in multidisciplinary fields.
