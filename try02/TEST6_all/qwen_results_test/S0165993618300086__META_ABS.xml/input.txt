Current and future impact of 3D printing on the separation sciences The potential of 3D printing to transform the field of separation science is becoming clear, based upon an increasing capacity to create highly customised devices, materials and structures, with complex geometries. The constantly improving print resolution and increasing variety of available print materials, including functional and composite materials, mean devices can be printed today, which would be extremely challenging to achieve using traditional manufacturing techniques. This review covers the majority of 3D printed devices to-date designed for use within the separation sciences, categorised under application within pre-separation, separation, and post-separation stages of analysis. It describes the impact 3D printing is having on the field, both current and future, recent achievements and challenges, and improvements required to reach its maximum potential as a transformative technology.
