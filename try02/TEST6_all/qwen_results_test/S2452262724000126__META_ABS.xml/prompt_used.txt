You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of zeolitic imidazolate framework/graphene oxide: A synergy of synthesis, properties and function for multifaceted applications in nanotechnology Zeolitic imidazolate framework/graphene oxide (ZIF/GO) hybrid materials are taken into consideration in the field of nanotechnology due to their intelligent integration of structure and function. This comprehensive review explores the synergistic combination of ZIFs and GO as a hybrid material, offering enhanced properties for multifaceted applications. The self-assembly of ZIFs, composed of metal ions coordinated with imidazolate linkers, provides a highly ordered porous framework, while GO, derived from oxidized graphene sheets, exhibits high surface area and mechanical strength. The integration of ZIFs and GO results in tunable porosity, improved electrical conductivity, and increased stability. This review discusses the synthesis strategies employed for fabricating ZIF/GO hybrids, such as in situ growth, solvothermal and hydrothermal methods, ultrasound, and nanopore lithography approaches. It elucidates the physical properties and chemical properties of ZIF/GO hybrids, encompassing structural characteristics, morphological features, thermal stability, electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance, and mechanical behavior. Furthermore, it explores the diverse applications of ZIF/GO hybrid materials in catalysis, energy storage, and transfer, as well as biomedical applications. The challenges and limitations associated with ZIF/GO hybrids are addressed, encompassing fabrication issues, stability concerns, selectivity optimization, and performance enhancement. This comprehensive review highlights the immense potential of ZIF/GO hybrid materials for multifaceted applications in nanotechnology, providing valuable insights for researchers and paving the way for future advancements in the field.
