You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Spray combustion of biomass fast pyrolysis oil: Experiments and modeling In this work, we are the first to report a detailed comparison between the predictions of a current Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for describing Fast Pyrolysis Oil (FPO) spray combustion and results from a laboratory-scale experiment. The objectives were to assess the predictive power of the CFD model, evaluate its usefulness in a numerical optimization scenario and characterize the spray flame. The spray flame was produced by using an air-assist atomizer piloted by a CH 4 /air flat-flame. Pyrolysis oil from a cyclone fast pyrolysis plant was combusted. The flame was characterized by using two-color pyrometry, Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy and high-magnification shadowgraphy. Overall, the assessed model correctly predicted flame structure and seemed appropriate for engineering applications, but lacked predictive power in estimating droplet size distributions. Numerical results were the most sensitive to variations in the initial droplet size distribution; however, seemed robust to changes in the multicomponent fuel formulation. Several conclusions were drawn regarding FPO spray combustion itself; e.g., the amount of produced soot in the flames was very low and droplets exhibited microexplosion behavior in a characteristic size-shape regime.
