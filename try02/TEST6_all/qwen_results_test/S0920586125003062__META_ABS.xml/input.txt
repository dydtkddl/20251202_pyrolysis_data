Catalyst synthesis, characterization, and testing for low-temperature hydrotreating of pyrolysis bio-oil The upgrading of biomass-derived pyrolysis oil (PO) to finished transportation fuels is challenging because of its thermal instability due to the presence of a high amount of oxygenates, specifically highly reactive aldehydes and ketones with a tendency to polymerize when they are exposed to high temperature. Therefore, this work focused on developing catalysts for low-temperature hydrotreating to stabilize POs derived from woody biomass. PtMoNi catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3(AL), activated carbon (AC), and alumina-carbon mixed (AL-AC) materials were synthesized, characterized, and tested for the hydrotreating of a wood-derived PO diluted with 20 wt% butanol, at temperatures between 235–280 °C in a batch reactor. The extents of reduction in oxygen, carbonyl, hydroxyl, and micro carbon residue contents were investigated. Among the three catalysts, PtMoNi/AL-AC performed the best in stabilizing the PO. The optimal operating conditions, which gave nearly 47 wt% deoxygenation and 84 % carbon retention, were as follows: temperature 250 °C, pressure 1400 psi, reaction time 4 h, and catalyst-to-PO ratio 0.1 g/g. Increasing reaction temperature beyond 250 °C improved deoxygenation but at the expense of liquid yield. Advanced catalyst characterization with XRD, BET, TEM, XANES, Raman spectroscopy and NH3-TPD revealed that the standing-out performance of the PtMoNi/AL-AC catalyst was related to its moderate acidic strength, strong metal-support interactions, higher surface area, good metal dispersion, ease in activation/sulfidation, and hydrogenation capability.
