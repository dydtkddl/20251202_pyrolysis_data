You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalyst synthesis, characterization, and testing for low-temperature hydrotreating of pyrolysis bio-oil The upgrading of biomass-derived pyrolysis oil (PO) to finished transportation fuels is challenging because of its thermal instability due to the presence of a high amount of oxygenates, specifically highly reactive aldehydes and ketones with a tendency to polymerize when they are exposed to high temperature. Therefore, this work focused on developing catalysts for low-temperature hydrotreating to stabilize POs derived from woody biomass. PtMoNi catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3(AL), activated carbon (AC), and alumina-carbon mixed (AL-AC) materials were synthesized, characterized, and tested for the hydrotreating of a wood-derived PO diluted with 20 wt% butanol, at temperatures between 235–280 °C in a batch reactor. The extents of reduction in oxygen, carbonyl, hydroxyl, and micro carbon residue contents were investigated. Among the three catalysts, PtMoNi/AL-AC performed the best in stabilizing the PO. The optimal operating conditions, which gave nearly 47 wt% deoxygenation and 84 % carbon retention, were as follows: temperature 250 °C, pressure 1400 psi, reaction time 4 h, and catalyst-to-PO ratio 0.1 g/g. Increasing reaction temperature beyond 250 °C improved deoxygenation but at the expense of liquid yield. Advanced catalyst characterization with XRD, BET, TEM, XANES, Raman spectroscopy and NH3-TPD revealed that the standing-out performance of the PtMoNi/AL-AC catalyst was related to its moderate acidic strength, strong metal-support interactions, higher surface area, good metal dispersion, ease in activation/sulfidation, and hydrogenation capability.
