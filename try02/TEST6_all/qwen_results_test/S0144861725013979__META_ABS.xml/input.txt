Closed-loop processing of in-situ modified wood: Biopolymer-structure-property relationships The linear consumption patterns dependent on non-renewable materials have triggered cascading environmental consequences marked by resource depletion and ecological degradation. Even the substantial improvements in energy efficiency, performance, and recycling of non-renewable materials cannot lead the way to mitigate the challenges—emphasising investment in sustainable resources (i.e., biopolymers) and processes. The foundation of a sustainable society depends on feedstocks, processing, products, and end-of-life, closing the materials loop. Recent developments in in-situ modified wood (IMW) have enabled wood to replace conventional fossils, mineral ores, and sand-derived products in various structural and functional applications. This review paper delves into the closed-loop processing of IMW by analysing resource renewability, embodied energy, and environmental impacts of production, benefits of products, and resource recovery. We systematically analyse the sustainability, properties, applications, waste management, along with challenges, feasibility, and environmental benefits of IMW in replacing traditional materials. The principal takeaway of the review is that by pledging to biopolymer-based natural resources in conjunction with sustainable practices, the IMW industry can evolve into an energy-efficient and environmentally benign producer of advanced materials.
