You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Closed-loop processing of in-situ modified wood: Biopolymer-structure-property relationships The linear consumption patterns dependent on non-renewable materials have triggered cascading environmental consequences marked by resource depletion and ecological degradation. Even the substantial improvements in energy efficiency, performance, and recycling of non-renewable materials cannot lead the way to mitigate the challenges—emphasising investment in sustainable resources (i.e., biopolymers) and processes. The foundation of a sustainable society depends on feedstocks, processing, products, and end-of-life, closing the materials loop. Recent developments in in-situ modified wood (IMW) have enabled wood to replace conventional fossils, mineral ores, and sand-derived products in various structural and functional applications. This review paper delves into the closed-loop processing of IMW by analysing resource renewability, embodied energy, and environmental impacts of production, benefits of products, and resource recovery. We systematically analyse the sustainability, properties, applications, waste management, along with challenges, feasibility, and environmental benefits of IMW in replacing traditional materials. The principal takeaway of the review is that by pledging to biopolymer-based natural resources in conjunction with sustainable practices, the IMW industry can evolve into an energy-efficient and environmentally benign producer of advanced materials.
