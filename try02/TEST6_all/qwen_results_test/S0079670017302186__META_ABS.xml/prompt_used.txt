You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Poly(vinyl chloride): current status and future perspectives via reversible deactivation radical polymerization methods Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is one of the more consumed polymers worldwide due to its general versatility and low cost. It is currently used in various applications ranging from packaging to construction. Currently PVC is only being prepared on an industrial scale by free-radical polymerization (FRP). However, the several intrinsic limitations of FRP triggered interest in synthesizing this polymer by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods. At the present time, single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP), single electron transfer degenerative chain transfer living radical polymerization (SET-DTLRP), cobalt-mediated radical polymerization (CMRP), supplemental activator and reducing agent atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) are RDRP methods that have been reported for vinyl chloride (VC) (co)polymerization. Here, these RDRP methods are critically discussed from three major standpoints. These are degree of control over polymerization, limitations and potential applications on an industrial scale.
