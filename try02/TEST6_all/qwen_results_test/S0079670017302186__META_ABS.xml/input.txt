Poly(vinyl chloride): current status and future perspectives via reversible deactivation radical polymerization methods Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is one of the more consumed polymers worldwide due to its general versatility and low cost. It is currently used in various applications ranging from packaging to construction. Currently PVC is only being prepared on an industrial scale by free-radical polymerization (FRP). However, the several intrinsic limitations of FRP triggered interest in synthesizing this polymer by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods. At the present time, single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP), single electron transfer degenerative chain transfer living radical polymerization (SET-DTLRP), cobalt-mediated radical polymerization (CMRP), supplemental activator and reducing agent atom transfer radical polymerization (SARA ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) are RDRP methods that have been reported for vinyl chloride (VC) (co)polymerization. Here, these RDRP methods are critically discussed from three major standpoints. These are degree of control over polymerization, limitations and potential applications on an industrial scale.
