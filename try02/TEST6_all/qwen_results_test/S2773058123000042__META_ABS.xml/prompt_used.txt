You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal sulfide-based catalysts in advanced oxidation processes for water decontamination Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, metal sulfide has been proven to be a promising ideal candidate for metal oxide catalysts and has been widely used in many catalytic fields. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially those based on metal sulfides, have been recognized as one of the most effective techniques for controlling water pollution due to their superior catalytic performance and stability. However, there is a lack of systematic summary and elaboration of the reported works on metal sulfide catalysts. This work reviews the synthesis, characterization and application of metal sulfide in AOPs for water decontamination. In addition, we further summarized the catalytic oxidation mechanisms of different metal sulfide-based AOPs and combined them with density functional theory (DFT) calculation to clarify the active root of the catalytic reactions of various metal sulfides. Finally, the application of metal sulfide is prospected, including the challenges in large-scale preparation, sulfur hydrochemistry and metal ion leaching, and the stability and reusability of metal sulfide. This review will help guide the future development of metal sulfide and further develop efficient and stable metal sulfide-based AOPs to better deal with water pollution.
