Metal sulfide-based catalysts in advanced oxidation processes for water decontamination Due to its unique physical and chemical properties, metal sulfide has been proven to be a promising ideal candidate for metal oxide catalysts and has been widely used in many catalytic fields. In recent years, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially those based on metal sulfides, have been recognized as one of the most effective techniques for controlling water pollution due to their superior catalytic performance and stability. However, there is a lack of systematic summary and elaboration of the reported works on metal sulfide catalysts. This work reviews the synthesis, characterization and application of metal sulfide in AOPs for water decontamination. In addition, we further summarized the catalytic oxidation mechanisms of different metal sulfide-based AOPs and combined them with density functional theory (DFT) calculation to clarify the active root of the catalytic reactions of various metal sulfides. Finally, the application of metal sulfide is prospected, including the challenges in large-scale preparation, sulfur hydrochemistry and metal ion leaching, and the stability and reusability of metal sulfide. This review will help guide the future development of metal sulfide and further develop efficient and stable metal sulfide-based AOPs to better deal with water pollution.
