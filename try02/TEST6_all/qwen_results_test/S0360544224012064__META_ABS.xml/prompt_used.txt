You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of poplar tree and polystyrene with HZSM-5 and Fe/HZSM-5 for production of light aromatic hydrocarbons The catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste is a highly effective approach for the production of light aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted on poplar tree (PT) and polystyrene (PS) using pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The experiments were carried out at a temperature of 550 °C and a mixing ratio of 1:1. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were employed for the characterization of HZSM-5 and Fe/HZSM-5 catalysts. The findings indicated that the metallic Fe in the HZSM-5 catalyst led to an enhanced production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAH) during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of PT and PS. The proportion of MAH in the products obtained from HZSM-5 and Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was determined to be 85.84 % and 90.87 %, respectively. In the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, several crucial reactions took place, including deoxidation, olefins aromatization, and Diels-Alder reaction between furans and olefins. In the presence of Fe metal, the HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited enhanced selectivity towards valuable MAH while effectively suppressing the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, resulting in an increase in MAH production to 90.87 %.
