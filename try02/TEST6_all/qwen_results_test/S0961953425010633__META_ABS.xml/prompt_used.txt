You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing bio-oil quality and hydrogen recovery through Co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch and polypropylene over a NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst The increasing accumulation of agricultural residues and plastic waste presents both environmental challenges and opportunities for energy recovery. Conventional disposal methods are inadequate, highlighting the need for efficient thermochemical valorization strategies. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) and oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) using a bimetallic NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the conversion efficiency and product quality of heterogeneous biomass–plastic blends. The originality of this research lies in harnessing synergistic feedstock interactions with a tailored bimetallic catalyst to improve liquid fuel and hydrogen-rich gas yields. Pyrolysis was carried out using a fixed-bed batch reactor at 400–600 °C with varying EFB:PP weight ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100). Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that PP promoted thermal degradation and reduced char formation. The NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a stable structure and homogeneous metal dispersion, which led to enhanced cracking, deoxygenation, and hydrocarbon formation. The optimal performance was observed at a 25:75 EFB:PP ratio, yielding the highest liquid fraction with an improved calorific value and lower density. Gas analysis revealed elevated hydrogen and light hydrocarbon contents at higher PP proportions, demonstrating the function of the catalyst in enhancing reforming reactions. These results demonstrate the critical influence of feedstock blending and catalyst design on optimizing co-pyrolysis for sustainable production of biofuels and hydrogen-rich syngas.
