Frontiers in polymer/carbon dots nanocomposites: Recent advances in synthesis and diverse applications A novel category of zero-dimensional (0-D) carbon nanomaterials measuring less than 10 nm in size known as carbon dots (CDs) has become an emerging frontier in material science. Due to the size of quantum dots, the presence of oxygen functional groups, and excellent fluorescence properties, CDs grabbed the attention of researchers towards the preparation of polymer nanocomposites. Due to their diverse properties, including functionality, aqueous dispersibility, ease of preparation from various biosources, and biocompatibility, carbon dots (CDs) hold significant potential for applications in biosensors, energy, optoelectronics, and sensors. When CDs are integrated into polymer matrices, these properties are enhanced, making high-performance polymer/CD nanocomposites. The synergistic interaction between the polymer matrix and CDs results in enhanced mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Polymers provide structural integrity, flexibility, and processability, while CDs contribute to the nanocomposite's optical activity, electrical conductivity, and environmental stability. Moreover, the surface functionalities of CDs can be tailored to improve compatibility with various polymers, enabling the design of targeted and customisable products. There are many review articles that presented the polymer/CDs nanocomposites with a narrow focus on very limited applications and properties. This review describes the synthesis approaches of Polymer/CDs nanocomposites, highlighting their diverse properties and applications in environmental, energy storage, and biomedical sectors. The review output will serve as a repository, which will facilitate further study and advancement in the field of polymer/CDs nanocomposites and their applicability.
