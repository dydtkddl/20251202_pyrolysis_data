You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Frontiers in polymer/carbon dots nanocomposites: Recent advances in synthesis and diverse applications A novel category of zero-dimensional (0-D) carbon nanomaterials measuring less than 10 nm in size known as carbon dots (CDs) has become an emerging frontier in material science. Due to the size of quantum dots, the presence of oxygen functional groups, and excellent fluorescence properties, CDs grabbed the attention of researchers towards the preparation of polymer nanocomposites. Due to their diverse properties, including functionality, aqueous dispersibility, ease of preparation from various biosources, and biocompatibility, carbon dots (CDs) hold significant potential for applications in biosensors, energy, optoelectronics, and sensors. When CDs are integrated into polymer matrices, these properties are enhanced, making high-performance polymer/CD nanocomposites. The synergistic interaction between the polymer matrix and CDs results in enhanced mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Polymers provide structural integrity, flexibility, and processability, while CDs contribute to the nanocomposite's optical activity, electrical conductivity, and environmental stability. Moreover, the surface functionalities of CDs can be tailored to improve compatibility with various polymers, enabling the design of targeted and customisable products. There are many review articles that presented the polymer/CDs nanocomposites with a narrow focus on very limited applications and properties. This review describes the synthesis approaches of Polymer/CDs nanocomposites, highlighting their diverse properties and applications in environmental, energy storage, and biomedical sectors. The review output will serve as a repository, which will facilitate further study and advancement in the field of polymer/CDs nanocomposites and their applicability.
