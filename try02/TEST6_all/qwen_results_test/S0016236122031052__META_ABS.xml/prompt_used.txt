You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge with polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/CaO: Effects on heavy metals behavior and ecological risk As an attractive method to recover energy and reduce heavy metals in the resultant biochar, co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics may increase the ecological risk of heavy metals. Considering the sound performance of CaO in dechlorination and immobilization of heavy metals, pyrolysis experiments were performed on four feedstocks and combined with the analysis of heavy metals to investigate the effects of temperature and added PVC/CaO on the behavior of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The results indicated that, increased temperature and added PVC could reduce the content of As, Pb, and Zn in biochar while CaO had the opposite effect, and the temperature set here had limited effect on the volatilization of Cr, Cu, and Ni with more than 90% of them remaining in biochar. Besides, compared with untreated sewage sludge, higher temperature and extra CaO could reduce the ecological risk of heavy metals in biochar by transforming them into more stable forms while the added PVC inhibited the transformation. When both PVC and CaO were present in pyrolysis system, although the ecological risk of heavy metals in biochar caused by PVC could be partially offset by increasing temperature and introducing CaO, it was still higher than that of other biochar. This study provides valuable insights for the treatment of heavy metals during sludge pyrolysis.
