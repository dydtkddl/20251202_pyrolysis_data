You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low- and high-temperature thermal hydrolysis pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of sludge: Process evaluation and fate of emerging pollutants The thermal hydrolysis process is a cutting-edge, widely used technology for the pretreatment of sludge before anaerobic digestion. Previous review articles addressed the mechanisms, optimization, and advantages of thermal hydrolysis for sludge management; however, a holistic comparison between low-temperature and high-temperature thermal hydrolysis processes is still lacking. The review aims to comprehensively examine the impacts of both low-temperature and high-temperature thermal hydrolysis processes on sludge solubilization, subsequent anaerobic digestion process performance and produced biosolids quality. Further, current thermal hydrolysis-related challenges, such as inhibitory compounds and residual ammonia, and their possible solutions are discussed. Moreover, both types of thermal hydrolysis processes are critically evaluated from technical, energetic, and economic standpoints. This review sheds light on the impact of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on the fate of various emerging pollutants in sludge, a topic overlooked in most previous review articles. Finally, this review highlights the research gaps worthy of coverage in future studies. By compiling and critically analyzing previous studies, this review aims to function as a comprehensive handbook for researchers looking to optimize the selection of the most suitable thermal hydrolysis process based on specific sludge conditions. Enhancing the efficiency of thermal hydrolysis in sludge anaerobic digestion holds the potential for improved sludge management, increased bioenergy recovery, and the generation of high-quality biosolids to address environmental and public health concerns associated with emerging pollutants. Consequently, this review aims to contribute to achieving multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, including #7 Affordable and Clean Energy, #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, and #13 Climate Action.
