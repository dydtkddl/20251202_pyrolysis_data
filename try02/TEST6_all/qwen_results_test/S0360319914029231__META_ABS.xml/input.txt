Experimental study on biomass steam gasification for hydrogen-rich gas in double-bed reactor Based on Response Surface Methodology, the experiments of biomass catalytic gasification designed by Design-Expert software were carried out in steam atmosphere and double-bed reactor. The response surface was set up with three parameters (gasification temperature, the content of K-based catalyst in gasification bed and the content of Ni-based catalyst in reforming bed) for biomass gasification performance of carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield to make analysis and optimization about the reaction characteristics and gasification conditions. Results showed that gasification temperature and the content of K-based catalyst in gasification bed had significant influence on carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield, whilst the content of Ni-based catalyst in reforming bed affected the gasification reactions to a large extent. Furthermore, appropriate conditions of biomass steam gasification were 800 °C for gasification temperature, 82% for the content of K-based catalyst in gasification bed and 74% for the content of Ni-based catalyst in reforming bed by the optimization model. In these conditions, the steam gasification experiments using wheat straw showed that carbon conversion efficiency was 96.9% while hydrogen yield reached 64.5 mol/kg, which was in good agreement with the model prediction. The role of the reforming bed was also analyzed and evaluated, which provided important insight that the employment of reforming bed made carbon conversion efficiency raised by 4.8%, while hydrogen yield achieved a relative growth of 50.5%.
