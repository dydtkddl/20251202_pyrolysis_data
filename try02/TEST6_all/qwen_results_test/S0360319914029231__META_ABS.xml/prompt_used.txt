You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on biomass steam gasification for hydrogen-rich gas in double-bed reactor Based on Response Surface Methodology, the experiments of biomass catalytic gasification designed by Design-Expert software were carried out in steam atmosphere and double-bed reactor. The response surface was set up with three parameters (gasification temperature, the content of K-based catalyst in gasification bed and the content of Ni-based catalyst in reforming bed) for biomass gasification performance of carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield to make analysis and optimization about the reaction characteristics and gasification conditions. Results showed that gasification temperature and the content of K-based catalyst in gasification bed had significant influence on carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield, whilst the content of Ni-based catalyst in reforming bed affected the gasification reactions to a large extent. Furthermore, appropriate conditions of biomass steam gasification were 800 °C for gasification temperature, 82% for the content of K-based catalyst in gasification bed and 74% for the content of Ni-based catalyst in reforming bed by the optimization model. In these conditions, the steam gasification experiments using wheat straw showed that carbon conversion efficiency was 96.9% while hydrogen yield reached 64.5 mol/kg, which was in good agreement with the model prediction. The role of the reforming bed was also analyzed and evaluated, which provided important insight that the employment of reforming bed made carbon conversion efficiency raised by 4.8%, while hydrogen yield achieved a relative growth of 50.5%.
