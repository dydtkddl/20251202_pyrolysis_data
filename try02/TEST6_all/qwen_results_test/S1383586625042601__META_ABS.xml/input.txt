Insight into the kinetics and thermodynamic analyses of thermally-induced phase separation and liquid fuel recovery from Co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and polyethylene The study investigated the kinetic, thermal, and thermodynamic behaviors of the co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene. The results showed an evident two-phase degradation of the different WCO-WP mixtures. WCO showed complete degradation in Phase 1(300–435 °C), whereas W3P1 showed a maximum degradation of 60.19 wt% among the mixtures at the same phase. The maximum weight loss temperatures for all the WCO-WP mixtures in Phase 2(435–510 °C) were found to be lower than that of WP. The correlation coefficient for diffusion models was 0.95–0.98, suggesting it to be the most probable reaction mechanism for WCO- WP co-pyrolysis. The activation energies of the mixtures for diffusion models were found to range from 103.33 to 122.66 kJ/mol and 73.42–258.88 kJ/mol in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. The recorded entropy values for the co-pyrolysis of mixtures were lower than the parent pyrolysis value, indicating a stable activated complex formation during co-pyrolysis. Moreover, the highest liquid yield of 67.2 wt% was obtained for the W1P1 proportion at 500 °C. The produced liquid oil has a calorific value in the range of 42.8 to 45.9 MJ/kg. The GC–MS analysis of the highest-yield liquid at various temperatures reveals that its primary compounds are alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols, highlighting its potential as an alternative fuel source. The highest alkane percentage of 31.85 % was recorded at 500 °C. Additionally, the obtained liquid oil contains 71.05 % to 80.33 % of C8–C16 hydrocarbons, which fall within the typical carbon chain range for jet fuels.
