Microbial production of 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid from lignin derivatives in an engineered Pseudomonas putida and its application for the synthesis of bio-based polyester Lignin valorization depends on microbial upcycling of various aromatic compounds in the form of a complex mixture, including p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid. In this study, an engineered Pseudomonas putida strain utilizing lignin-derived monomeric compounds via biological funneling was developed to produce 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC), which has been considered a promising building block for bioplastics. The biosynthetic pathway for PDC production was established by introducing the heterologous ligABC genes under the promoter P tac in a strain lacking pcaGH genes to accumulate a precursor of PDC, i.e., protocatechuic acid. Based on the culture optimization, fed-batch fermentation of the final strain resulted in 22.7 g/L PDC with a molar yield of 1.0 mol/mol and productivity of 0.21 g/L/h. Subsequent purification of PDC at high purity was successfully implemented, which was consequently applied for the novel polyester.
