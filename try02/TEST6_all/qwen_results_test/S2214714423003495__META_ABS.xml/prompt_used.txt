You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption of ibuprofen from aqueous solution onto a raw and steam-activated biochar derived from recycled textiles insulation panels at end-of-life: Kinetic, isotherm and fixed-bed experiments This study explores the potential use of recycled textile biochar (RT-BC) and steam-activated biochar (RT-SABC), derived from insulation panels at end-of-life, as sorbents for removing ibuprofen from aqueous solutions. After steam activation, the surface area and micropore volume increased. Subsequently, kinetic and isotherm experiments were investigated at 20 °C, 200 rpm and 50 mg/L ibuprofen solution. Equilibrium was reached after 24 h for RT-BC and 120 h for RT-SABC. The kinetics of RT-BC and RT-SABC followed the pseudo-first-order and Elovich models, respectively. RT-SABC isotherm showed the highest adsorption capacity (53.9 mg g−1), well-fitted into the Sips model. Ibuprofen uptake by RT-SABC was nearly irreversible. Afterward, RT-SABC dynamic performance was evaluated in a fixed-bed column for three bed heights. The breakthrough point (41.7–476.7 h), the volume of effluent treated (0.6–6.4 L at breakthrough) and adsorption capacity (22.09–39.81 mg g−1) increased with bed height (10–30 cm). Thomas and Clark's models simulated the experimental points, confirming second-order kinetics and Sips isotherm. Different functional groups were involved in the adsorption mechanism. Preliminary experiments in tap water on RT-SABC showed a removal (>83 %) due to ionic strength and reduced pH. Therefore, RT-SABC could be an efficient adsorbent for ibuprofen removal from aqueous systems.
