You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in the production processes of hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude and aid-in investigation techniques This review provides an overview of recent advances in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biocrude production processes using plastics as feedstock, seawater as the processing medium, and microwave irradiation as a process intensification method. Additionally, the review examines the application of aid-in investigation tools such as kinetics, machine learning, and feasibility analysis to HTL research. All these aspects have been underexplored in review literature compared to process optimization, biocrude upgrading, continuous HTL, and aqueous phase reutilization. The potential of HTL as an effective method for the depolymerization of plastics is initially evaluated. The ease of plastic depolymerization follows the order of polycarbonate (300 °C) > polystyrene (350 °C) > polyethylene = polypropylene (420 °C) > polyethylene terephthalate (>450 °C). Both synergism and antagonism are observed for co-HTL of plastics with biomass, ranging from −48.3% to 79.2%. Using seawater as an alternative HTL processing medium shows promising potential, while the effect of sea salts on biocrude yield/quality is still controversial especially when carbohydrate-rich feedstocks are utilized, necessitating more comprehensive examination. Microwave irradiation has been shown to increase biocrude yield from lipid, produce comparable yields from protein and lignin, and decrease yield from carbohydrate compared to conventional heating. As for the aid-in investigation tools, limited efforts have been made to apply kinetic modeling to the HTL of plastics, which could be particularly useful when synergism or antagonism is observed during co-HTL of plastics and biomass. Machine learning-enabled predictions of product yield and quality have been found to be more accurate than traditional mathematical models. Future research could focus on using machine learning algorithms to elucidate product formation mechanisms. The techno-economic and life cycle assessment reveal that the commercialization of HTL technology remains a distant prospect, further improvements in product yield, quality, and process energy efficiency are essential. Overall, this review offers augmented insights into HTL technology and facilitates the identification of novel opportunities, which is of value to promote the biocrude production.
