You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD modeling of the coke combustion in an industrial FCC regenerator Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is one of the most important conversion processes used in refineries all over the world. It is used for the conversion of heavy oil feed with high boiling temperature to produce gasoline, diesel, propylene and other valuable products. Coke deposits on the catalyst during the catalytic conversion and deactivates it, therefore catalyst is continuously regenerated in the FCC process. The regeneration step is essential as it directly impacts the products yields. The coke combustion also generates NOx and SOx emissions which levels are highly influenced by the bed hydrodynamics, the operation parameters and the reactor configuration, and are important to quantify. For all these reasons, the understanding of the regenerator hydrodynamic and kinetic is essential. This paper presents a study on the coupling of Barracuda™ CFD code with a coke combustion kinetic model developed at IFP Energies nouvelles to simulate an industrial FCC regenerator. Regenerator operating and performance data, including catalyst samples for coke analysis, are acquired on a selected industrial unit to evaluate the model. The results provide useful insight on the regenerator performance characteristics in terms of air distribution, coke burning rate and temperature profile in the regenerator. The steady state flue gas composition and regenerator dense and dilute phase temperatures are well predicted by the CFD simulation. The CFD prediction of the bed density is underestimated compared to the industrial data. The duration required to completely regenerate the catalyst is also estimated from the results. The CFD coupled coke combustion kinetic model presented in this paper enables us to evaluate the influence of the fluidized bed hydrodynamic on the catalyst regeneration in an industrial FCC regenerator. The developed model serves as a useful tool for the evaluation of future technology development in the FCC regenerator.
