You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Benzylation of benzene over Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolites: Correlation between activity and adsorption properties The performance of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts (prepared by incipient wetness, 0.5–2.5% of Fe) for benzylation of benzene by benzyl chloride was studied in this work and explained in terms of their chemical and adsorption properties. Catalysts were characterised by ICP-MS, XPS, XRD, nitrogen physisorption and calorimetry (in order to determine their surface acidity). Adsorption properties of the catalysts (for the reactants and products) have been studied by inverse gas chromatography (IGC). Enthalpies of adsorption, dispersive energies of adsorption, and specific interaction were selected as parameters to characterise the interaction of benzene, benzyl chloride and diphenylmethane with the studied catalysts. Reaction experiments, carried out in an isothermal batch reactor, showed that increasing amounts of iron lead to more active catalyst, but less selective for the formation of diphenylmethane. Experimental data were modelled considering a serial-parallel scheme. Results reported in this paper, suggest that the reaction is controlled by the adsorption and activation of the benzyl chloride. The addition of iron to the ZSM-5 zeolite largely increases the interaction between this compound and the catalyst surface.
