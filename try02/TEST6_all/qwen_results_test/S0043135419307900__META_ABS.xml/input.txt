Co-doping polymethyl methacrylate and copper tailings to improve the performances of sludge-derived particle electrode Three-dimensional electrochemical reactor (3DER) is a highly efficient technology for refractory wastewater treatment. Particle electrodes filled between anode and cathode are the core units of 3DER, determining the treatment efficiency of wastewater. However, particle electrodes deactivation due to catalytic sites coverage seriously impedes the continuous operation of 3DER. In this work, granular sludge carbon (GSC) particle electrodes being resistant to deactivation are fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and copper tailings, whose performances are evaluated by degrading rhodamine B (RhB) wastewater in a continuous-flow 3DER. Results indicate that hierarchical-pore structure comprising macro-, meso-, and micropores is developed in GSC-10-CTs by doping 10 g PMMA and 5 g copper tailings into 100 g waste sludge. PMMA contributes to construct macropores, which is essential for the mass transfer of RhB into GSC particle electrodes of centimeter-size. Copper tailings promote the formation of meso- and micro-pores in GSCs, as well as improving the electrochemical properties. Consequently, GSC-10-CTs packed 3DER exhibits the highest removal efficiency and lowest energy consumption for RhB treatment. In addition, the compressive strength of GSC-10-CTs is enhanced by copper tails, that is crucial to fill into 3DER as particle electrodes. The high-efficient and cost-effective GSC-10-CTs fabricated by waste materials have the potential of substituting commercial granular activated carbon catalysts in the future, consequently promoting the application of 3DER in wastewater treatment.
