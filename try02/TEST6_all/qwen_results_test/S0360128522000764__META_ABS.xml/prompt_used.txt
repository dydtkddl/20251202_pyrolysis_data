You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sorption direct air capture with CO2 utilization Direct air capture (DAC) is gathering momentum since it has vast potential and high flexibility to collect CO2 from discrete sources as “synthetic tree” when compared with current CO2 capture technologies, e.g., amine based post-combustion capture. It is considered as one of the emerging carbon capture technologies in recent decades and remains in a prototype investigation stage with many technical challenges to be overcome. The objective of this paper is to comprehensively discuss the state-of-the-art of DAC and CO2 utilization, note unresolved technology bottlenecks, and give investigation perspectives for commercial large-scale applications. Firstly, characteristics of physical and chemical sorbents are evaluated. Then, the representative capture processes, e.g., pressure swing adsorption, temperature swing adsorption and other ongoing absorption chemical loops, are described and compared. Methods of CO2 conversion including synthesis of fuels and chemicals as well as biological utilization are reviewed. Finally, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment for DAC application are summarized. Based on research achievements, future challenges of DAC and CO2 conversion are presented, which include providing synthesis guidelines for obtaining sorbents with the desired characteristics, uncovering the mechanisms for different working processes and establishing evaluation criteria in terms of technical and economic aspects.
