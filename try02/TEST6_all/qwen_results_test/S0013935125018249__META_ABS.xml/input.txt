Navigating towards a plastic-free future: A holistic review of microplastic accumulation and management for land and environmental sustainability Bioaccumulation of micro (nano) plastics (MNPs) in freshwater and marine ecosystems) and their consumption by life forms can lead to health decline. Importance of suitable infrastructure growth, waste valorization, cost-effective methods for managing plastic waste, and feasible options to reduce in the environment were proposed in this study. Results suggested that introducing MPs at varying concentrations reduces key soil enzyme activities, indicating a dose-dependent effect on microbial functions. MPs interact with heavy metals, influencing plant biomass and chlorophyll levels, likely due to reduced metal bioavailability and changes in microbial abundance. In food chains, MPs pose risks to human health, with significant ingestion from contaminated sources potentially leading to oxidative stress and physiological disturbances in both humans and marine wildlife. Repurposing plastic waste in construction enhances material properties and reduces environmental impact. Additionally, activated carbon from plastic waste shows strong pollutant adsorption capabilities, aiding environmental remediation.
