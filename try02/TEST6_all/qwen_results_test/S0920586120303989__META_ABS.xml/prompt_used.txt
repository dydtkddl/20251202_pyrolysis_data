You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A catalytic reactive distillation approach to high density polyethylene pyrolysis – Part 2 – Middle olefin production A catalytic reactive distillation reactor, previously described, was improved to increase the production of middle and heavy hydrocarbons, to be used as feedstock or fuel in the viewpoint of a Circular Economy of plastics. The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were run using high density polyethylene (HDPE) under several experimental conditions, with a 1 % (w/w) of HZSM-5 for catalytic pyrolysis. Three different temperatures were tested in each case and the influence of the reaction time was evaluated at 500 °C and 430 °C for thermal pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, respectively. Thermal pyrolysis of HDPE produced the higher amount of solid products (80 %wt. or higher) under the form of a waxy cream-colored material (wax) for all the experimental sets. For catalytic pyrolysis, the major product fraction was always liquid. The analysis of the liquid products showed that, for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, the products obtained were within the range of C5 to C11, with a higher yield on C8 and C9 in the case of thermal pyrolysis and on C6 and C7 for catalytic pyrolysis. The aim of this study was the development of an integrated reactor/separation system to increase the middle olefin production. It is possible with this reactor design to direct the pyrolysis of HDPE to the production of middle olefins that can be reused in the petrochemistry industry, as chemical feedstock, including in the production of new plastics.
