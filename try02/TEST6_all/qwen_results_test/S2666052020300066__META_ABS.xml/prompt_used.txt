You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oil yield optimization from co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using simplex lattice mixture design In this study, a novel approach to optimization of oil yield from the co-pyrolysis of Low-density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polystyrene (PS) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) was investigated at 450 °C and residence time of 90 min. Simplex lattice mixture design (SLMD) was applied to investigate the oil recovery process to optimize the mixture compositions for maximum oil yield and to observe the blending behavior of the three plastic samples in relation to oil yield. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed the model generated was significant with a p-value <0.0001, R 2 value of 0.9698, adjusted R 2 of 0.9482 and predicted R 2 of 0.9038. The model in terms of actual components, shows that the components LDPE, PS and PET have relative impacts of 31.18, 43.77 and 1.99, respectively on oil recovery. Non-linear blending LDPE × PET has a negative impact of 30.13, while LDPE × PS and PS × PET have positive impacts of 57.76 and 7.81, respectively on oil yield. The optimum mixture composition for the oil yield was 32.3% LDPE, 67.7% PS and 0% PET. The highest percent feedstock conversion of 99.9% was attained with mixture ratio 0.00 LDPE:1.00PS:0.00PET, while the lowest feedstock conversion of 86.90% was achieved with the mixture ratio 00.00 LDPE:0.00PS:1.00PET.
