Energy-efficient sintering-free Chemically synthesized carbon nanofibers for high-performance supercapacitors This work introduces a cost-effective method to synthesize carbon nanofibers (CNFs) at a lower temperature (∼100 °C), addressing the synthesis cost and precursor selection challenges associated with traditional methods requiring temperatures of ⁓3000 °C. Acid-etched banana fibers served as sustainable precursors, while KClO3 acted as a liquid carbonization medium. The resulting CNFs (referred MCCNFs), exhibited hollow structures with intertwined tubular morphology (OD ∼20–40 nm and ID∼ 5–10 nm). They possessed a hexagonal porous structure (P63/mmc) with a high specific surface area (152.09 m2g-1), significant pore volume (0.459 ccg−1), and impressive tensile strength exceeding 2.71 TPa. Smaller intensity ratio of D and G bands (0.396) confirmed their purity and structural integrity. MCCNFs displayed semi-metallic behaviour with superior electrical conductivity (0.0386 S-m−1), validated by ab initio electronic band structure calculations. UV–vis absorption spectra revealed a linear band structure. Notably, MCCNFs displayed a record-breaking capacitance of 1412.5 Fg-1 at 5 Ag-1, making them promising for supercapacitor electrode applications. Furthermore, these CNFs were used to fabricate a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor, successfully powering 6 LEDs for 10 s. Hence, this work set a pave for low-cost, low-temperature synthesis of CNFs having superior physical and chemical properties and immense promise for advancing energy storage applications.
