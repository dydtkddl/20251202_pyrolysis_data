You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Energy-efficient sintering-free Chemically synthesized carbon nanofibers for high-performance supercapacitors This work introduces a cost-effective method to synthesize carbon nanofibers (CNFs) at a lower temperature (∼100 °C), addressing the synthesis cost and precursor selection challenges associated with traditional methods requiring temperatures of ⁓3000 °C. Acid-etched banana fibers served as sustainable precursors, while KClO3 acted as a liquid carbonization medium. The resulting CNFs (referred MCCNFs), exhibited hollow structures with intertwined tubular morphology (OD ∼20–40 nm and ID∼ 5–10 nm). They possessed a hexagonal porous structure (P63/mmc) with a high specific surface area (152.09 m2g-1), significant pore volume (0.459 ccg−1), and impressive tensile strength exceeding 2.71 TPa. Smaller intensity ratio of D and G bands (0.396) confirmed their purity and structural integrity. MCCNFs displayed semi-metallic behaviour with superior electrical conductivity (0.0386 S-m−1), validated by ab initio electronic band structure calculations. UV–vis absorption spectra revealed a linear band structure. Notably, MCCNFs displayed a record-breaking capacitance of 1412.5 Fg-1 at 5 Ag-1, making them promising for supercapacitor electrode applications. Furthermore, these CNFs were used to fabricate a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor, successfully powering 6 LEDs for 10 s. Hence, this work set a pave for low-cost, low-temperature synthesis of CNFs having superior physical and chemical properties and immense promise for advancing energy storage applications.
