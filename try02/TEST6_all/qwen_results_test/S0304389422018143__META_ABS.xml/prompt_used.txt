You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Three-dimensional porous high boron-nitrogen-doped carbon for the ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of trace heavy metals in food samples Exposure to even trace amounts of Cd(II) and Pb(II) in food can have serious effects on the human body. Therefore, the development of novel electrochemical sensors that can accurately detect the different toxicity levels of heavy metal ions in food is of great significance. Based on the principle of green chemistry, we propose a new type of boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon (BCN) material derived from a metal-organic framework material and study its synthesis, characterization, and heavy-metal ion detection ability. Under the optimum conditions, the BCN-modified glassy carbon electrode was studied using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry, which showed good electrochemical responses to Cd(II) and Pb(II), with sensitivities as low as 0.459 and 0.509 μA/μM cm2, respectively. The sensor was successfully used to detect Cd(II) and Pb(II) in Beta vulgaris var. cicla L samples, which is consistent with the results obtained using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. It also has a strong selectivity for complex samples. This study provides a novel approach for the detection of heavy metal ions in food and greatly expands the application of heteroatom-doped metal-free carbon materials in detection platforms.
