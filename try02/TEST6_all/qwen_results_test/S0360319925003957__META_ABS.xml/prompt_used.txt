You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam reforming of glycerol for co-producing hydrogen and carbon nanotubes over nanoscale Ni-based catalysts: Insights into support effect and carbon deposition Glycerol, a major byproduct of biodiesel production, is commonly used as an inexpensive feedstock for hydrogen (H2) production through catalytic reforming. Developing efficient Ni-based catalysts with appropriate supports remains a challenge. In this study, three Ni-based catalysts, each containing 10 wt% Ni with different supports: carbon nanofibers (Ni@CNF), activated carbon (Ni/AC), and alumina (Ni/γ-Al2O3), were comparatively evaluated for their effectiveness in the catalytic steam reforming of glycerol. The results show that both the catalyst support and the reforming temperature influence the co-production of H2 and carbon nanotubes. All three catalysts exhibit good catalytic performance of H2 production at 700 °C for 1 h. The corresponding H2 yields, based on a steam-glycerol molar ratio of 11.9 and a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, are 86.5%, 81.3%, and 69.2% for Ni@CNF, Ni/AC, and Ni/Al2O3, respectively. Ni@CNF demonstrates high H2 production and good catalytic stability, whereas Ni/Al2O3 generates high-yield carbon nanotubes.
