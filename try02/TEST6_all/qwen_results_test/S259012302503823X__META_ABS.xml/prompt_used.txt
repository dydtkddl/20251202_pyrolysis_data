You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of acid catalysts on yield and selectivity of plastics waste pyrolysis from municipal solid waste in Samui Island, Thailand Due to concerns about plastic waste affecting solid waste management, pyrolysis has emerged as an intriguing technology that enhances sustainability potential by reducing harmful plastic waste in ecosystems and natural resource usage as well as generating profits from its products as an alternative fuel for engines. In this study, Samui Island plastic waste was used as feedstock for pyrolysis. The process was carried out at different temperatures (425 °C, 450 °C, and 475 °C), different amounts of catalyst loading (0, 1, 3, 5 wt.%), and different types of catalysts (HY zeolite, NaY zeolite, spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and Fe/Al2O3). The results showed that the pyrolysis at 450 °C with 3 wt.% of spent FCC catalyst provided the highest amount of liquid product. In addition, the pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) produced the most liquid product (91.44 wt.%), while the liquid products from the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) exhibited the highest percentage of diesel (36.60 wt.%). After improving product yield from a mixture of PE/polypropylene (PP)/PS (80:15:5), a representative sample of plastic waste from Samui Island, the results demonstrated that the pyro-diesel was comparable to commercial diesel, with a low operating cost (0.33 USD/L) and improved pyrolysis oil quality (0.65 USD/L).
