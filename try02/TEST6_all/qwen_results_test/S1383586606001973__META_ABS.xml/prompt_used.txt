You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sorptive potential of a cationic exchange resin of carboxyl banana stem for mercury(II) from aqueous solutions A cationic exchange resin of carboxyl banana stem (CBS) was fabricated through the hydrolysis of graft copolymer of banana stem (BS) with acrylonitrile that was made using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) initiator. Infrared spectroscopy and acid–base titration were used to confirm graft copolymer formation and carboxylate functionalization. SEM studies of CBS clearly indicated that adsorbent has rough and porous surface caused by rigid and hydrophobic nature of acrylonitrile cross-links. Thermal stability of the CBS was studied using thermogravimetry. The cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of the CBS was determined to be 1.68mequiv.g−1. The sorptive potential of the CBS for mercury(II) from aqueous solutions was examined by the batch technique. The optimum pH range for the maximum removal of mercury(II) was 6.0–9.0. The CBS was observed to have high adsorptive capacity for mercury(II) with 99.3% from a solution containing 10mgL−1 of mercury(II) with 0.2% (w/v) concentration of CBS. The experimental kinetic data for the mercury(II)–CBS system were analyzed using the linearised form of the Elovich model, a second-order kinetic equation. The isotherm data were correlated reasonably with the Langmuir isotherm and the mercury(II) adsorption capacity was found to be 90.88mgg−1 at 30°C. The quantitative removal of 10mgL−1 mercury(II) in 50mL chlor-alkali industry wastewater by 125mg of CBS was observed at pH 6.0. The mercury(II)-loaded CBS can be regenerated by 0.1M HCl treatment without altering the adsorbent properties.
