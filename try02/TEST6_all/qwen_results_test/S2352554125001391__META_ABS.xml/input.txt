Pyrolysis of Quercus cerris kernels for the production of bio-oil and activated biochar for methylene blue adsorption from aqueous phase This study investigates the optimized thermal slow pyrolysis process of Quercus cerris kernels (QCK) as a novel and non-edible feedstock to yield pyrolytic oil (PO) and biochar (BC). The optimized slow pyrolysis of the QCK produced the maximum output of the PO at 475 °C for 60 min using a particle size of 0.297 mm and a heating rate of 30 °C/min. Under these conditions, yields of the PO, bio-oil (BO), BC, and gases were 56.75 %, 29.41 %, 25.0 %, and 18.25 %, respectively. 1H NMR and GC-MS spectroscopy were employed to analyze the BO. The results revealed that the BO primarily comprised oxygen-containing compounds (85.23 %) and hydrocarbons (12.61 %). Esters constituted the highest proportion (34.33 %), followed by acids (22.20 %), alcohols (14.40 %), and furans (2.25 %). The K2CO3 activation was implemented to convert the BC into activated biochar (ABC). The optimal ABC was produced by implementing a 1.5:1 K2CO3: BC activating ratio and activation for 1.5 h at 750 °C. This ABC had an elevated BET surface area of 1666.50 m2/g and a microporous structure, with a mean pore diameter of 1.90 nm. This ABC eliminated methylene blue dye (MB) from an aqueous solution with an efficiency of 99.42 %. The adsorption of MB was best represented by the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-2nd-order kinetics model. The adsorption capacity of MB amounted to 531.52 mg/g. Thus, the QCK could serve as a promising precursor for producing high-quality BO and a high surface area adsorbent to eliminate dyes from wastewater.
