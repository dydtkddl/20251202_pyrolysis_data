You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

2-Methylfuran (MF) as a potential biofuel: A thorough review on the production pathway from biomass, combustion progress, and application in engines Currently, the development of alternative and green energy sources has been being strongly pushed aiming to recoup the lack of fossil energy, to meet the ever-increasing demand of energy use in modern society, and to palliate concerns regarding environmental pollution and global climate change. Therefore, producing energy from biomass sources has recently been of great interest because biomass is considered as a reliable and ubiquitous source. Indeed, the conversion of biomass into furan derivatives through the catalytic production process is emerging as a fascinating and promising method. Being one of the furan-based compounds, 2-Methylfuran (MF) is known as a critical platform substance and an ideal green solution on the pathway of finding alternative fuels because the MF properties are similar to those of fossil fuels and MF could be generated from renewable biomass source. In this review paper, the process of MF synthesis from biomass through catalyst reactions was thoroughly analyzed. More importantly, the pyrolysis and oxidation progress of MF was also critically presented aiming to clarify the applicability of MF to internal combustion engines. Finally, the performance, the characteristics of combustion, and pollutant formation of internal combustion engines fueled with MF were discussed in detail. In general, MF could become a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines although studies on the engine durability, compatibility to materials, tribology behaviors should be further carried out in the future.
