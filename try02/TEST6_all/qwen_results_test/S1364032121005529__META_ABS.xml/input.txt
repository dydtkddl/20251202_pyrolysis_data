2-Methylfuran (MF) as a potential biofuel: A thorough review on the production pathway from biomass, combustion progress, and application in engines Currently, the development of alternative and green energy sources has been being strongly pushed aiming to recoup the lack of fossil energy, to meet the ever-increasing demand of energy use in modern society, and to palliate concerns regarding environmental pollution and global climate change. Therefore, producing energy from biomass sources has recently been of great interest because biomass is considered as a reliable and ubiquitous source. Indeed, the conversion of biomass into furan derivatives through the catalytic production process is emerging as a fascinating and promising method. Being one of the furan-based compounds, 2-Methylfuran (MF) is known as a critical platform substance and an ideal green solution on the pathway of finding alternative fuels because the MF properties are similar to those of fossil fuels and MF could be generated from renewable biomass source. In this review paper, the process of MF synthesis from biomass through catalyst reactions was thoroughly analyzed. More importantly, the pyrolysis and oxidation progress of MF was also critically presented aiming to clarify the applicability of MF to internal combustion engines. Finally, the performance, the characteristics of combustion, and pollutant formation of internal combustion engines fueled with MF were discussed in detail. In general, MF could become a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines although studies on the engine durability, compatibility to materials, tribology behaviors should be further carried out in the future.
