Application of persulfate salts for enhancing UV disinfection in marine waters Over the years, industrial activities that generate high salinity effluents have been intensifying; this has relevant potential for causing organic and microbiological pollution which damages both human and ocean health. The development of new regulations, such as ballast water convention, encourage the development of treatment systems that can be feasible for treating seawater effluents. Accordingly, an approach based on the UV activation of persulfate salts has been assessed. In this scenario, two different persulfate sources (S2O8 2− and HSO5 −) were evaluated under UV-C irradiation for disinfection purposes. An optimization process was performed with low chemical doses ( E. coli > E. faecalis ≈ Marine Heterotrophic Bacteria. With an evaluation of regrowth after treatment, greater cell damage was detected with the addition of persulfate salts. The major ability of regrowth for marine bacteria encourages the use of a residual disinfectant after disinfection processes.
