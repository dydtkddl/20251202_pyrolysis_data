Technological challenges, research advancements and future prospects towards valorization of pine wastes Pine wastes especially pine needles are one of the abundantly found forestry wastes but are identified as the cause for destruction of forest ecosystem and are the major contributors to hazardous greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution as well as climate change. Under the context of circular economy, valorization to biofuels and biochemicals is a fruitful and successful strategy adopted for effective waste management of pine waste residues. But for successful execution and for industrial operation, there are the compositional hurdles and technological challenges with respect to production of each such value-added product. The review has not only highlighted such challenges but has focussed on assessment of some of the research and technological advancements made till date so as to enhance the yield as well as quality of the valorized products. The endeavour is to contribute to environmental sustainability and resource management by encouraging sustainable and efficient utilization of pine residues.
