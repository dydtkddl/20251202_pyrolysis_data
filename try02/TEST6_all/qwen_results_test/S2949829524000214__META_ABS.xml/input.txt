A review on microplastics degradation with MOF: Mechanism and action Microplastics (MPs) constitute a serious threat to the environment due to their pervasiveness and potential negative effects on various life forms. The quest for novel methods targeting the degradation of MPs has increased in recent years. Recent studies and research, focussed on techniques like biodegradation, thermal degradation, pyrolization and nanoparticle-mediated microplastic degradation as a prominent way to overcome this issue. In the realm of emerging methodologies, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit significant potential for MPs degradation. MOFs are highly porous 2D or 3D materials with a large surface area, adaptable chemical composition, and configurable pore size. These properties render MOFs suitable for the adsorption and degradation of MPs. The efficacy of MOF-mediated MPs degradation is dependent on the type of MOF, size, shape of MPs, and environmental conditions. They are also sustainable, efficient, and adaptable materials, making them suited for MPs degradation. This review examines diverse methodologies for the degradation of MPs, encompassing processes such as hydrolysis, oxidation, photo-degradation, bio-mimicking, phase transformation, and photoelectrochemical mechanisms. Future research prospects on the application of MOFs for MP degradation have also been addressed. MOF-mediated MP degradation is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to represent a significant advancement in this area. The last section of the review covers the field's obstacles and constraints, including ways to use MOFs for microplastic clean-up that are economical, environmentally friendly, and technically comprehensive.
