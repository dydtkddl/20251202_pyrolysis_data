Recent advances in valorization of organic municipal waste into energy using biorefinery approach, environment and economic analysis Researcher’s all around works on a copious technique to lessen waste production and superintend the waste management for long-term socio-economic and environmental benefits. Value-added products can be produced from municipal waste by using holistic and integrated approaches. In this review, a detail about the superiority of the different methods like anaerobic digestion, biofuel production, incineration, pyrolysis and gasification were used for the conversion of municipal waste to feedstock for alternate energy and its economic- environmental impacts were consolidated. Most conversion techniques were environmentally friendly to manage municipal waste. The biological process was more economically feasible compare to the thermal process, for the reason thermal process required a large amount of capital investment and energy utilization. In the thermal process, gasification shows low emission, and pyrolysis shows low capital investment and economically feasible compare to other thermal processes. Waste to energy technology significantly reduced the emission and energy demand.
