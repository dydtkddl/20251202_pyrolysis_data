You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ synthesis nitrogen-doped graphene/Cu composites with enhanced mechanical and electrical properties For graphene/metal composites, both the synthesis of graphene and the interfacial bonding with the metal matrix are crucial for determining overall performance. In this study, in-situ nitrogen-doped graphene/Cu composites were successfully fabricated using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the carbon source, and the effects of PAN-derived graphene on composite microstructure, mechanical properties, and electrical performance were systematically investigated. The results show that an optimal PAN content of 0.25 wt% promotes the formation of high-quality in-situ graphene, which simultaneously strengthens the copper matrix and improves electrical stability. On the mechanical side, the composite showed a yield strength of 408 MPa and a tensile strength of 427 MPa, with increases of 63 % and 42 %, respectively, compared to pure copper. This enhancement is primarily attributed to dislocation strengthening, grain refinement, and load transfer, with graphene reinforcing the composite by restricting dislocation motion, impeding grain growth, and providing the intrinsic high strength of graphene. On the electrical side, the composite maintained a high room-temperature electrical conductivity of 94.2 % IACS while achieving a reduced temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 3.68 × 10-3 K−1, which results from the high intrinsic conductivity and negative TCR of graphene. These findings highlight the dual role of PAN-derived graphene in enhancing both the mechanical and electrical properties, offering valuable insights into the development of high-performance graphene/metal composites for industrial applications.
