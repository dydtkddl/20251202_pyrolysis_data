You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Identification and quantification of tire wear particles by employing different cross-validation techniques: FTIR-ATR Micro-FTIR, Pyr-GC/MS, and SEM Tire wear particles (TWPs) are one of the environment's most important emission sources of microplastics. In this work, chemical identification of these particles was carried out in highway stormwater runoff through cross-validation techniques for the first time. Optimization of a pre-treatment method (i.e., extraction and purification) was provided to extract TWPs, avoiding their degradation and denaturation, to prevent getting low recognizable identification and consequently underestimates in the quantification. Specific markers were used for TWPs identification comparing real stormwater samples and reference materials via FTIR-ATR, Micro-FTIR, and Pyrolysis–gas-chromatography–mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS). Quantification of TWPs was carried out via Micro-FTIR (microscopic counting); the abundance ranged from 220,371 ± 651 TWPs/L to 358,915 ± 831 TWPs/L, while the higher mass was 39,6 ± 9 mg TWPs/L and the lowest 31,0 ± 8 mg TWPs/L. Most of the TWPs analyzed were less than 100 μm in size. The sizes were also confirmed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), including the presence of potential nano TWPs in the samples. Elemental analysis via SEM supported that a complex mixture of heterogeneous composition characterizes these particles by agglomerating organic and inorganic particles that could derive from brake and road wear, road pavement, road dust, asphalts, and construction road work. Due to the analytical lack of knowledge about TWPs chemical identification and quantification in scientific literature, this study significantly contributes to providing a novel pre-treatment and analytical methodology for these emerging contaminants in highway stormwater runoff. The results of this study highlight the uttermost necessity to employ cross-validation techniques, i.e., FTIR-ATR, Micro-FTIR, Pyr-GC/MS, and SEM for the TWPs identification and quantification in the real environmental samples.
