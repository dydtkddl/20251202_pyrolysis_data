You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and application of lanthanum-cobalt bimetallic modified composite ZSM-5/MCM-41 zeolite: Enhancing the stability of aromatic compounds produced by lignin cracking in catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust Bimetallic modified (lanthanum and cobalt) micro-mesoporous composite ZSM-5/MCM-41 zeolite was prepared by recrystallization and impregnation to improve the aromatic compound yield during in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust. Monometallic modified catalysts were prepared for comparison. Catalytic pyrolysis was conducted in a fixed bed reactor at 550 °C for 15 min. The structure-function relationship of the catalysts was studied based on SEM, TEM, BET, XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, and Py-IR. The results showed that under the premise of ensuring the bio-oil yield, the catalyst simultaneously doped with lanthanum (16 wt%, La2O3) and cobalt (4 wt%, Co3O4) had the highest aromatic compound yield (79.92%), which was 23.79% higher than that of non-catalytic pyrolysis. In addition, the adjustment of pore structure and acid sites caused by modification and the interaction between doped metal atoms enhanced the aromatic compound stability during pyrolysis, thus leading to a high yield of phenols from lignin cracking.
