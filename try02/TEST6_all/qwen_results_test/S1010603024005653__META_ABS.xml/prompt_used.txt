You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Heterostructured g-C3N4-TiO2 nanocomposites applied to p-toluic acid degradation under solar light-induced photocatalytic process In this work, heterostructured photocatalysts were prepared with TiO2-P25 nanocrystals dispersed on two-dimensional layers of g-C3N4. Different g-C3N4:TiO2 ratios (25 %, 50 % and 75 %) were prepared using a wet method under ultrasonic exfoliation and thermal treatment under an oxidizing atmosphere. The heterojunctions were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy, showing TiO2 nanocrystals anchored onto the surface of the g-C3N4 structure. The obtained heterojunctions increased light absorption from the ultraviolet to the visible spectrum and reduced the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers confirmed by photoluminescence and band gap energy (Eg) measurements. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated in the degradation of p-toluic acid (p-TA) (20 mg L–1) under UVA LED at 365 nm, a polychromatic lamp (UVA-UVB-visible) and solar radiation. The g-C3N4:TiO2 ratio of 25 % showed the best performance, reaching 95 % degradation after 180 min under solar radiation. The reuse tests showed that the mineralization capacity determined by total organic carbon (TOC) remained stable for 6 cycles, achieving 80.8 % TOC degradation. The heterojunction induced a significant alteration in the rheological behavior of the suspension, which made the g-C3N4-TiO2 easily recoverable, unlike the pure TiO2. The radical scavengers study indicated that the superoxide anion radical (O2 •–) is the main oxidative species in p-TA photodegradation on g-C3N4-TiO2 photocatalyst. The greatest advantage of the g-C3N4 in the composite was the absorption of light in the visible range and facile catalyst recovery for reuse while presenting photocatalytic activity similar to TiO2.
