You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigations on the dissolved organic matter leached from oil-contaminated soils by using pyrolysis remediation method Pyrolysis, as a convenient and fast technology, has been proved to be promising in the remediation of oil-contaminated soil. However, little is known about the dissolved organic matter (DOM) associated with pyrolyzed oil-contaminated soil and its environmental impact. Herein, optical spectroscopic techniques (i.e., absorbance and fluorescence) were adopted to reveal the relationship between the pyrolysis temperature and the characteristics of the DOM and the associated phytotoxicity. Results show that one of the main factors determining the properties and phytotoxicity of DOM leached from the pyrolyzed soil is the critical temperature (approximately 325 °C) during pyrolysis. When the temperature was lower than 325 °C, more types and quantities of DOM, mainly fulvic acid-like substances, were desorbed from the soil with the temperature, which have little effect on wheat growth. However, when the temperature was in the range of 325–550 °C, the type and quantity of DOM increased first and then decreased as the temperature increased, during which the organic matter in the soil decomposed. The wheat growth was first inhibited and then promoted. Finally, the correlation between the spectral indices of DOM with the phytotoxicity suggested that fluorescent components identified by parallel factor analysis were positively correlated with phytotoxicity. This study indicates the pyrolytic remediation of oil-contaminated soil should avoid some critical temperature ranges.
