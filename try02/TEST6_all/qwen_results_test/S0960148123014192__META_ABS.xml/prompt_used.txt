You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation of the deoxygenated and decarburized biomass cascade utilization system for comprehensive upgrading of green hydrogen generation Steam gasification of biomass is of great significance for achieving efficient hydrogen-rich syngas production. However, the yield and the quality of H2 in the product require further improvements. In this study, a strengthened biomass cascade utilization system via synergistic deoxygenation and decarburization is investigated. The system is composed of a deoxygenated and decarburized gasification reactor and a deoxidizer and decarburizer material regenerator. In the gasification reactor, a series of deoxidizer and decarburizer materials, CaO-Fe (Ca: Fe > 1.0), are applied for accomplishing high-quality hydrogen production; In the regenerator, the deoxidizer and decarburizer material is regenerated (CaCO3+ Ca2Fe2O5→CaO–Fe) with released gas utilization. The effects of gasification temperatures, Ca/Fe, H2O/C, and (CaO + Fe)/B mole ratios are evaluated by Aspen Plus, achieving comprehensive optimization of the parameters. The H2 yield reaches 68.16 mol s−1 kg−1 biomass and the H2 concentration is up to 93.58 vol%, which increases by 254.45 % and 109.87 % compared with the results without deoxygenation and decarburization. Additionally, the deoxidizer and decarburizer material can be completely regenerated via released gas reduction, thereby ensuring the consistent looping of the entire system. This paper sheds light on the synergistic deoxygenation and decarburization methodology for biomass-to-hydrogen generation, which provides a robust guidance for further experiments in the future.
