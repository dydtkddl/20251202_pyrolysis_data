You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deep eutectic solvents-assisted alkali lignin modification for pyrolytic monophenols production The efficient valorization of alkali lignin (AL) remains a significant challenge due to the multiple impurities and complex structure of AL. Lignin modification through deep eutectic solvent (DES) and subsequent fast pyrolysis offers a promising alternative for AL valorization. Thus, this study comprehensively investigated the potential of DES-pretreated ALs (DESALs) for producing pyrolytic monophenols, with particular focus on the modification process of AL during DES pretreatment, the interaction of lignin-DES, and the techno-economic feasibility of the integrated technology. Notably, under optimal experimental conditions, the ChCl/ethylene glycol (CCEG) system demonstrated the greatest potential to enhance the yields of 4-vinyl syringol (4VS) and 4-propenyl syringol (4PS) to 12.09 wt%, achieving a selectivity of 40.60 %, without using a catalyst. Moreover, multiscale simulations were performed to illustrate the enhancement effect of DESs on the production of pyrolytic monophenols. The CCEG system exhibited the lowest |HOMO-LUMO| energy gap (161.80 kcal/mol) and the highest interaction energy (−56.56 kcal/mol). The chloride ions played an integral role in forming robust hydrogen bonds between CC and EG. Further investigation indicated that the adduct and acetal structures were synthesized, and their formation pathways were subsequently modeled. Finally, the CCEG system exhibited a negligible environmental impact and high economic feasibility.
