  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on alkali lignin modification using deep eutectic solvents followed by pyrolysis, but alkali lignin is not a plastic or polymer waste material, and the primary focus is on computational simulations rather than lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic waste."
