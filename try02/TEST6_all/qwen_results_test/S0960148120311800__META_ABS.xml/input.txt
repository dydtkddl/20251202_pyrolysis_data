Technological and economic aspect of Refuse Derived Fuel pyrolysis The article presents the results of RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) examination in order to use it for energy purpose. RDF material was subjected to thermogravimetric analysis. The TGA analysis confirmed the multi-component nature of tested material. It also indicated that the mixture consists of a minimum of 2 types of materials: biomass and thermoplastic polymers. The pyrolysis was conducted as a batch process with the use of a processing furnace supplied by the IZO Company. RDF sample was pyrolysed under 900 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Obtained char and gaseous sample, as well as raw material, were subjected to elemental and gas chromatographic analysis. Furthermore, using ANSYS CHEMKIN-PRO software, numerical simulations of these samples were conducted. Based on the results of composition of pyrolysis gas, the numerical model was validated. Next, modelling of chemical composition of gas from RDF pyrolysis for a pilot installation working in Poland was performed. In addition, the evaluation of the investment costs for the exemplary installation for the thermal conversion of RDF using pyrolysis was made. For this purpose, dynamic methods of investment project assessment were used, which take into account the distribution of anticipated revenues and expenses related to a given investment project over time.
