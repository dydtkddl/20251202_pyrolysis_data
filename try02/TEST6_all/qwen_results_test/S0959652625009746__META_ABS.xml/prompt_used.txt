You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel thermostable PETase from Kibdelosporangium aridum: Heterologous expression, immobilization and poly(ethelene terephthalate) decomposition applications Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used plastic in various industries, contributing significantly to environmental pollution. Conventional methods for PET degradation are often associated with high costs, limited efficiency, and environmental harm. Consequently, biological approaches are gaining interest as sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternatives for PET degradation. This study focused on the expression, biochemical characterization, and immobilization of a novel PET-degrading cutinase, known as PETase, isolated from Kibdelosporangium aridum (KaPETase). This enzyme presents a new thermostable alternative for addressing PET biodegradation at elevated temperatures. The cutinase gene from Kibdelosporangium aridum was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells using the pET-22b(+) plasmid. The resulting recombinant KaPETase was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, yielding a specific activity of about 6 U mg−1. The enzyme was immobilized in ZIF-8 and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. The optimal pH and temperature for KaPETase preparations were determined to be 8.0 and 75 °C, respectively. In addition, the free enzyme maintained 80 % of its maximum activity at 100 °C. Through immobilization in ZIF-8, the catalytic efficiency and thermal stability of KaPETase were enhanced approximately three- and four-fold, respectively, PET degradation was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, demonstrating the strong potential of both free and immobilized KaPETases for effective PET decomposition. Future research could focus on advanced in silico analyses, enzyme engineering, bioprocess scaling, and comprehensive assessments of PET degradation to further optimize this approach.
