You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of plastic waste into fuels: A critical review Plastic wastes have posed serious threats to the environment, including decrease of soil nutrient effectiveness and agricultural production as well as emerge of ecological instability. Fuel conversion from plastic waste is regarded as a promising strategy for its disposal and energy utilization. Plastic wastes can be converted into target fuels by adjusting cracking of chemical bonds. Currently, numerous technologies regarding fuel conversion from plastic wastes have been reported, including conventional pyrolysis, novel heat treatment and advanced oxidation. However, systematic summary and comparative analysis of different technologies are still scarcely reported. In this review, fuel conversion from plastic wastes was summarized comprehensively, highlighting novel heat treatment and advanced oxidation technologies reported in recent years. Furthermore, the superiority and drawbacks of each technology were analyzed, and future prospects of technology application were proposed. With lower reaction temperature and higher-value fuel, novel heat treatment of plastics is more popular than traditional one. Advanced oxidation can be controlled to convert plastics into fuels under room temperature and pressure, guiding the new normal in energy utilization of plastic wastes. This review aims to provide inspiration for energy utilization of solid waste, addressing the issues of white pollution and energy shortage.
