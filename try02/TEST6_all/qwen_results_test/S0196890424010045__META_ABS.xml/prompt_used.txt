You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Toward sustainability of Waste-to-Energy: An overview The rapid increase in urban populations has led to a significant rise in municipal solid waste, necessitating innovative waste management solutions within a circular economy. This review examines the potential of waste-to-energy technologies to transform waste into a sustainable energy source, addressing both waste management and energy production challenges. Analyzing over 100 studies, the review covers value chain analysis, thermal treatment, techno-economic analysis, life-cycle assessment, power generation, and energy/exergy analysis. Value chain analysis indicates that integrated supply chains enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Thermal treatment processes can reduce waste volume by up to 90%. Techno-economic analyses show these technologies are economically viable with appropriate policies. Life-cycle assessments reveal electricity recovery efficiencies up to 27.40%. Waste-to-energy technologies can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Integrated systems can achieve overall energy efficiencies of 60%, with high efficiencies and environmental benefits seen in plasma gasification. This review underscores the role of Waste to Energy technologies in enhancing waste management and highlights the necessity for continued innovation and policy support to fully realize their potential.
