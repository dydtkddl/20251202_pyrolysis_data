Toward sustainability of Waste-to-Energy: An overview The rapid increase in urban populations has led to a significant rise in municipal solid waste, necessitating innovative waste management solutions within a circular economy. This review examines the potential of waste-to-energy technologies to transform waste into a sustainable energy source, addressing both waste management and energy production challenges. Analyzing over 100 studies, the review covers value chain analysis, thermal treatment, techno-economic analysis, life-cycle assessment, power generation, and energy/exergy analysis. Value chain analysis indicates that integrated supply chains enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Thermal treatment processes can reduce waste volume by up to 90%. Techno-economic analyses show these technologies are economically viable with appropriate policies. Life-cycle assessments reveal electricity recovery efficiencies up to 27.40%. Waste-to-energy technologies can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Integrated systems can achieve overall energy efficiencies of 60%, with high efficiencies and environmental benefits seen in plasma gasification. This review underscores the role of Waste to Energy technologies in enhancing waste management and highlights the necessity for continued innovation and policy support to fully realize their potential.
