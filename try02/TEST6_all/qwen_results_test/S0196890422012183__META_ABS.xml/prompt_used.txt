You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of pyrolysis vapors derived from non-biodegradable waste plastics (PET) into valuable fuels using nickel-impregnated HZSM5-70 catalysts Recycling waste plastics into pyrolytic fuels is a highly promising energy-saving approach. The improvement and enhancement of the resulting fuel quality from heavy oil-derived-waste plastics pyrolysis is in high demand. We performed catalytic reforming of heavy oils-derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pyrolysis to simultaneously improve the quality of oils into valuable fuels (gasoline-range hydrocarbon) and reduce the oxygenated compounds. Nickel-impregnated HZSM5-70 catalysts were prepared by the wet-impregnation method. The catalytic process was carried out in a catalytic tubular reactor at a constant feeding rate of 2.5 mL/h. In particular, various processing factors were examined by varying the impregnation loading of nickel (2–10 wt%), catalyst mass (1–5 wt%), and process temperature (400–500 °C). Increasing any of the three process parameters resulted in a relatively similar decrease in the quantity of liquid products and an improvement in the quality of reformed products. The best quality of reformed oils were obtained at 5 % catalyst loading and 10 % nickel loading on the catalyst at 450 °C. FT-IR analyses show that raising process parameters has a substantial influence on increasing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon content, while lowering the quantity of undesired products (acids, alcohols, and ketones) in the oils. GC–MS analysis results confirmed that the relative content/area of liquid products predominantly contains gasoline-range hydrocarbons (C5-C12), with a total of 33.39 % on blank-run. The hydrocarbons (C5-C12) production from HZSM5-70 and NiO/HZSM5-70 was greatly enhanced to 66.48 % and 85.05 %, repectively, while the oxygenated compounds, including alcohols, acids, and ketones were reduced from 39.38 to 10.75 % (total area). In comparison to HZSM5-70, the NiO/HZSM5-70 catalyst performs more effectively, retaining its catalytic activity after five cycles (∼3 % decrease). Thus, the NiO/HZSM5-70 exhibits high catalytic performance and reusability.
