You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave processes: A viable technology for obtaining xylose from walnut shell to produce lactic acid by Bacillus coagulans Biorefining uses alternative resources (such as biomass) instead of petrochemical sources to produce bioenergy and platform chemicals. Walnut shell is a promising lignocellulosic biomass for the production of fermentable carbohydrates. In this study, the platform chemical L-(+) lactic acid was produced after walnut shell had been treated with physicochemical and biological processes. So biomass waste can be regenerated to the benefit of the circular bio-economy. Autohydrolysis assisted by microwave processes was used to depolymerize hemicellulose and amorphous cellulose in walnut shell to yield 63.5% w/w of xylose in a liquid fraction (hydrolysate) with a minimum yield of glucose. The optimum reaction conditions to obtain a high xylose yield with a low byproduct titer were 190 °C for 25 min. L-(+) lactic acid was produced by thermophilic Bacillus coagulans DSM 2314 with a carbon source of xylose and glucose which were solubilized in hydrolysate from autohydrolyzed walnut shell. A non-sterile and straightforward fermentation medium coupled with a pH adjustment of the crude hydrolysate in an anaerobic environment led to a L- (+) lactic acid yield of 81% w/w with a productivity of 0.2 g/L/h.
