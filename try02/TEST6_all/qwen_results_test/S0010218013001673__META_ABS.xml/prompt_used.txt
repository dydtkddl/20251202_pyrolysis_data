You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combustion and pyrolysis of iso-butanol: Experimental and chemical kinetic modeling study The first reaction mechanism for iso-butanol (372 species and 8723 reversible elementary reactions) pyrolysis and combustion that includes pressure dependent kinetics and proposes reaction pathways to soot precursors has been automatically generated using the open-source software package RMG. High-pressure reaction rate coefficients for important hydrogen abstraction reactions from iso-butanol by hydrogen, methyl and HO2 were calculated using quantum chemistry at the CBS-QB3 level. The mechanism was validated with recently published iso-butanol combustion experiments as well as new pyrolysis speciation data under diluted and undiluted conditions from 900 to 1100K at 1.72atm representative of fuel rich combustion conditions. Sensitivity and rate of production analysis revealed that the overall good agreement for the pyrolysis species, and in particular for the soot precursors like benzene, toluene and 1,3-cyclopentadiene, depends strongly on pressure dependent reactions involving the resonantly stabilized iso-butenyl radical. Laminar flame speed, opposed flow diffusion flame speciation profiles, and autoignition are also well-captured by the model. The agreement with speciation profiles for the jet-stirred reactor could be improved, in particular for temperatures lower than 850K. Flux and sensitivity analysis for iso-butanol consumption revealed that this is primarily caused by uncertainty in iso-butanol+OH, iso-butanol+HO2 and the low temperature peroxy chemistry rates. Further theoretical and quantum chemical studies are needed in understanding these rates to completely predict the combustion behavior of iso-butanol using detailed chemistry.
