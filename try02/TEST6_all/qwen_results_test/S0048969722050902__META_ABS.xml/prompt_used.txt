You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Current status of microplastics and nanoplastics removal methods: Summary, comparison and prospect In modern society, plastics also play an indispensable role in people's lives due to their various excellent properties. However, when these plastic products are discarded after being used, after being subjected to external influences, they will continue to be worn, damaged and degraded into micro- and nano-scale plastics, which are microplastics and nanoplastics (M/NPs). Although people's attention has been paid to M/NPs at present, the focus is still mainly on the detection and hazard of M/NPs, and how to remove M/NPs is relatively less popular. This review was written in order to draw the attention of more researchers to remove M/NPs. This review first briefly introduces the research background of M/NPs, and also shows the main analytical methods currently used for qualitative and quantitative M/NPs. Then, most of the current literature on the removal of M/NPs was collected, and they were classified, summarized, and introduced according to the classification of physical, physicochemical, and biological methods. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods are summarized, and they are also compared, which can help more researchers choose the appropriate method for research. In addition, the application scenarios of these methods are briefly introduced. Finally, some future research directions are proposed for the current research status of M/NPs removal. It is hoped that this will further promote the development on the method of removing M/NPs.
