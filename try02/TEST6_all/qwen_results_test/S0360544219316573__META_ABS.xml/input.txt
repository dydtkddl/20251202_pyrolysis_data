Production of gasoline-like-fuel and diesel-like-fuel from hard-resin of Yang (Dipterocarpus alatus) using a fast pyrolysis process Production of gasoline-like-fuel and diesel-like-fuel from Yang (Dipterocarpus alatus) hard resin (HY) was studied for use as a fuel for engines using a fast pyrolysis process. HY was pyrolyzed in a semi-continuous reactor at pyrolysis temperatures of 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C. For each pyrolysis temperature, height of the reflux condenser (RC) was changed between 0 m (non-reflux condenser, NRC) and 1 m. Bio-oil products from each pyrolysis condition were distilled into light fuel and heavy fuel to find the optimal fuel production conditions. Fuel obtained from the optimal conditions as pyrolysis temperature 500 °C and a 1 m RC was measured for density, viscosity, heat value, distillation and corrosion compared to commercial fuels. Under these conditions, HY 100 wt% produced 55.22 wt% of fuel, separated into 17.81 wt% light fuel and 37.41 wt% heavy fuel with total specific energy consumption 6.78 kWh/kg. Using RC increased the amount of distilled products. Characteristics of heavy and light fuels were similar to standard fuels as DLF (diesel-like-fuel) and GLF (gasoline-like-fuel) respectively.
