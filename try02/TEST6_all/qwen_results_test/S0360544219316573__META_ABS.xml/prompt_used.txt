You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of gasoline-like-fuel and diesel-like-fuel from hard-resin of Yang (Dipterocarpus alatus) using a fast pyrolysis process Production of gasoline-like-fuel and diesel-like-fuel from Yang (Dipterocarpus alatus) hard resin (HY) was studied for use as a fuel for engines using a fast pyrolysis process. HY was pyrolyzed in a semi-continuous reactor at pyrolysis temperatures of 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C. For each pyrolysis temperature, height of the reflux condenser (RC) was changed between 0 m (non-reflux condenser, NRC) and 1 m. Bio-oil products from each pyrolysis condition were distilled into light fuel and heavy fuel to find the optimal fuel production conditions. Fuel obtained from the optimal conditions as pyrolysis temperature 500 °C and a 1 m RC was measured for density, viscosity, heat value, distillation and corrosion compared to commercial fuels. Under these conditions, HY 100 wt% produced 55.22 wt% of fuel, separated into 17.81 wt% light fuel and 37.41 wt% heavy fuel with total specific energy consumption 6.78 kWh/kg. Using RC increased the amount of distilled products. Characteristics of heavy and light fuels were similar to standard fuels as DLF (diesel-like-fuel) and GLF (gasoline-like-fuel) respectively.
