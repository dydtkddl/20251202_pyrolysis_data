Nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates Recent developments in biomineralization have already demonstrated that nanosized crystals and particles play an important role in the formation of hard tissues of animals. Namely, it is well established that the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals are nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates in the form of apatites. In mammals, tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological apatite have been found to be combined into self-assembled structures under the control of bioorganic matrixes. Therefore, application and prospective use of the nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are also well known. For example, greater viability and better proliferation of various types of cells have been detected on smaller crystals of calcium orthophosphates. Thus, the nanosized and nanocrystalline forms of calcium orthophosphates have great potential to revolutionize the hard tissue-engineering field, starting from bone repair and augmentation to controlled drug delivery systems. This paper reviews the current state of art and recent developments of various nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates, starting from synthesis and characterization to biomedical and clinical applications. The review also provides possible directions for future research and development.
