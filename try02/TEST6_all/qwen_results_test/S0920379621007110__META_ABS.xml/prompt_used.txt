You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Irradiation hardening and ductility loss of Eurofer97 steel variants after neutron irradiation to ITER-TBM relevant conditions Ten Eurofer97 steel variants, produced by non-standard fabrication-processing routes and modified alloying chemistries, were studied by neutron irradiations in the high flux isotope reactor. The irradiations were performed to ITER-TBM relevant conditions of ∼255–350 °C, 2.94–3.24 dpa. We quantified the irradiation-induced degradation of the steels using mechanical property tests. All the steels suffered from irradiation hardening, where a significant increase in Vickers microhardness and yield stress (σYS) occurred, accompanied with severe loss of tensile elongation. The extent of hardening was material dependent. For Tirr = 300±30 °C, most steels showed σYS increase in the range of ∼30% to as high as ∼66%, except for a low temperature tempered steel with σYS increase below 15%. Despite large losses in elongation, most failures were ductile. Significant post-necking ductility was retained with reduction in area (RA) between 65–75%, but <50% for low temperature tempered steels. The ultimate tensile stress to yield stress (σUTS/σYS) ratios decreased significantly after irradiation, highlighting irradiation-induced strain hardening capacity reduction. No major effect of irradiation on the plastic instability stress (σPIS) and true fracture stress of the steels was observed. By comparing the tensile stresses in true stress units and with literature, the results suggest that RAFM steel designing should target materials with a large separation between σPIS and σYS, to ensure the materials can maintain large work hardening and uniform deformation capability after irradiation. The tensile data of the steels additionally revealed a compelling evidence of an inverse trend between the change in RA and increase in σYS of the neutron irradiated Eurofer97 type steels.
