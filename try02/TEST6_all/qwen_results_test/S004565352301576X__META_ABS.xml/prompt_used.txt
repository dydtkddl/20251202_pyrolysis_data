You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficiently catalytic degradation of tetracycline via persulfate activation with plant-based biochars: Insight into endogenous mineral self-template effect and pyrolysis catalysis Endogenous mineral of plant such as potassium, calcium and iron may play a crucial role in boosting the physicochemical structure and catalytic activity of high temperature pyrolyzed plant-based biochar while it is often neglected owing to its relative less content. Herein, self-template pyrolyzed plant-based biochars were prepared from two different ash-contained agricultural wastes of peanut hull (PH, 3.2% ash) and cotton straw (CS, 0.8% ash), and aimed at investigating the relationship among the endogenous mineral fractions of plant-based biomass, physicochemical active structure and persulfate (PS) catalytic degradation activity for tetracycline (TC). The results of energy/spectral characterization showed that under the self-template effect and pyrolysis catalysis of endogenous minerals, PH biochar (PBC) possessed much more specific surface area, conjugated graphite domain, C=O and pyrrolic-N surface active functional sites than CS biochar (CBC), enhancing TC removal rate of PBC/PS to 88.37%, twice that of CBC/PS (44.16%). Meanwhile, reactive oxygen quenching and electrochemical experiments showed that electrons transfer and non-free radical pathways based on singlet oxygen contributed 92% of TC removal in PBC/PS system. Remarkably, by comparing the differences in structure and TC removal performance of pre-deashing and non-deashing prepared plant-based biochars, a possible mechanism for endogenous mineral components' self-template effect and pyrolysis catalysis role of plant-based biomass was proposed. This study provides a new insight for revealing the intrinsic mechanism of mineral elements enhancing the active surface structures and catalytic properties of plant-based biochars derived from distinct feedstocks.
