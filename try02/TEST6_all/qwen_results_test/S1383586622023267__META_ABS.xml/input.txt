Interactions between graphene oxide and polyester microplastics changed their phototransformation process and potential environmental risks: Mechanism insights Co-existence of microplastics (MPs) and carbon-based nanomaterials is expected to be a common scenario in the natural environment as the large amount of plastics discarded into the environment and the wide spread use of carbon-based nanomaterials. Unfortunately, knowledge on their interaction in water under light irradiation remains limited. In this study, interaction between graphene oxide (GO) and polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET MPs) as well as changes in their potential risks under phototransformation process are systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that GO has a stronger inhibitory effect on the phototansformation of PET MPs with smaller particle size. Interestingly, incorporation of GO on the surface of PET MPs was quantified with carbon-14-labeled graphene (14C-LG), and it was found that more GO was bonded on the smaller size PET MPs. Furthermore, a higher adsorption capacity toward triclosan (TCS) was observed in the GO-bonded PET MPs, suggesting that GO-bonded PET MPs would pose higher potential environmental risks. Overall, this study reveals the interaction between GO and PET MPs in their phototransformation process and the enhanced potential environmental risks caused by the incorporation of GO on PET MPs, which is helpful to understand their environmental fate and risks.
