You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interactions between graphene oxide and polyester microplastics changed their phototransformation process and potential environmental risks: Mechanism insights Co-existence of microplastics (MPs) and carbon-based nanomaterials is expected to be a common scenario in the natural environment as the large amount of plastics discarded into the environment and the wide spread use of carbon-based nanomaterials. Unfortunately, knowledge on their interaction in water under light irradiation remains limited. In this study, interaction between graphene oxide (GO) and polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET MPs) as well as changes in their potential risks under phototransformation process are systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that GO has a stronger inhibitory effect on the phototansformation of PET MPs with smaller particle size. Interestingly, incorporation of GO on the surface of PET MPs was quantified with carbon-14-labeled graphene (14C-LG), and it was found that more GO was bonded on the smaller size PET MPs. Furthermore, a higher adsorption capacity toward triclosan (TCS) was observed in the GO-bonded PET MPs, suggesting that GO-bonded PET MPs would pose higher potential environmental risks. Overall, this study reveals the interaction between GO and PET MPs in their phototransformation process and the enhanced potential environmental risks caused by the incorporation of GO on PET MPs, which is helpful to understand their environmental fate and risks.
