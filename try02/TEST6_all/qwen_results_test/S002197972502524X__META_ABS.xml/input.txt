Softwood biochar-supported Bi2WO6 for photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminant mixture in river water: Role of pyrolysis temperature and surface functionality The design of efficient biochar-supported photocatalysts for the removal of emerging contaminants requires a fundamental understanding of the influence of biochar properties on photocatalyst structure and performance. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the effects of biochar feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of biochar-supported bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) composites for the degradation of 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG) and other emerging contaminants. Biochar derived from two softwood feedstocks (cedar and a mix of pine and spruce) was pyrolyzed at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C) to serve as a support for Bi2WO6. This work reveals the critical impact of biochar surface area, porosity, and redox-active functional groups on the interaction with Bi2WO6, which influence the crystal orientation, surface area, redox properties, and the resulting composite photocatalytic behavior. Composites synthesized using biochar pyrolyzed at 400 °C demonstrated optimal performance and a 74-fold enhancement in DPG photocatalytic rate constant compared to bare Bi2WO6. The optimal composite was further applied to treat river water spiked with five organic contaminants, achieving 94.36 % removal of the total mixture and a 55.4 % reduction in total organic carbon, confirming its effectiveness in complex matrices. This study highlights the critical role of biochar support properties in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 and establishes guidelines for the development of sustainable photocatalysts for water treatment applications.
