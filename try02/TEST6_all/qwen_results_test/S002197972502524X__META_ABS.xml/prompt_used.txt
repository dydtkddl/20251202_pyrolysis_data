You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Softwood biochar-supported Bi2WO6 for photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminant mixture in river water: Role of pyrolysis temperature and surface functionality The design of efficient biochar-supported photocatalysts for the removal of emerging contaminants requires a fundamental understanding of the influence of biochar properties on photocatalyst structure and performance. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the effects of biochar feedstock and pyrolysis temperature on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of biochar-supported bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) composites for the degradation of 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG) and other emerging contaminants. Biochar derived from two softwood feedstocks (cedar and a mix of pine and spruce) was pyrolyzed at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C) to serve as a support for Bi2WO6. This work reveals the critical impact of biochar surface area, porosity, and redox-active functional groups on the interaction with Bi2WO6, which influence the crystal orientation, surface area, redox properties, and the resulting composite photocatalytic behavior. Composites synthesized using biochar pyrolyzed at 400 °C demonstrated optimal performance and a 74-fold enhancement in DPG photocatalytic rate constant compared to bare Bi2WO6. The optimal composite was further applied to treat river water spiked with five organic contaminants, achieving 94.36 % removal of the total mixture and a 55.4 % reduction in total organic carbon, confirming its effectiveness in complex matrices. This study highlights the critical role of biochar support properties in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 and establishes guidelines for the development of sustainable photocatalysts for water treatment applications.
