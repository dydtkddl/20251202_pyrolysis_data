Coffee waste valorization: A comprehensive review of recent advancements and future directions for a circular bioeconomy Spent coffee grounds (SCG) present both an environmental challenge and a significant nutritional opportunity. This comprehensive review of coffee waste valorization focuses on its transformation into safe, high-value ingredients within the food and nutritional sectors for a circular bioeconomy. Diverse SCG applications are detailed, focusing on the extraction and utilization of bioactive compounds (lipids, fiber, phenolics) for functional foods and nutraceuticals. Findings are critically synthesized, including the impact of compositional variability (species, roasting) on quality and the need for rigorous food safety assessments. These must address critical challenges like contaminant monitoring (mycotoxins, acrylamide) and regulatory compliance. Biotechnological strategies (mycoremediation, enzyme-assisted extraction) for enhancing nutritional value are also discussed. Future research prioritizes type-specific valorization, advancing green extraction (microwave, ultrasound assisted), and ensuring robust toxicological and long-term stability analyses for commercialization. This focused analysis confirms SCG’s vital role in accelerating a sustainable, resource-efficient bioeconomy through innovation in food systems.
