You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The use of different materials to form the intermediate layers of tubular carbon nanofibers/carbon/alumina composite membranes for removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions The primary aim of this study was to use different materials to form the intermediate layers of tubular carbon nanofibers/carbon/alumina composite membranes (TCCACMs) for removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions. To this end, plastic wrap made from four different materials (i.e., polyethylene, polymethylpentene, polyvinylchloride, and polyvinylidenechloride) were evaluated for their suitability as the precursors to form the aforementioned intermediate layers, on which carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were deposited for further fabrication of TCCACMs. Based on the results of thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopic observations, only polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyvinylidenechloride (PVDC) films met the criteria to form the intermediate carbon layers of good quality. TCCACMs thus prepared were designated PVC-TCCACM and PVDC-TCCACM, respectively. Proposed structure of TCCACMs and relevant separation mechanisms were also revealed in this work. PVC-TCCACM and PVDC-TCCACM were then incorporated into a simultaneous electrocoagulation and electrofiltration (EC/EF) module respectively for removing three selected pharmaceuticals (i.e., caffeine, acetaminophen, and sulfamethoxazole) from aqueous solutions. The tested water specimens were artificially spiked with respective pharmaceuticals in deionized water yielding a concentration of ca. 200μg/L. Under the optimal operating conditions PVC-TCCACM yielded the greatest removal efficiencies for caffeine (i.e., 95.8%) and sulfamethoxazole (i.e., 94.9%); whereas PVDC-TCCACM for acetaminophen (i.e., 79.8%). Evidently, couplings of the EC/EF module with suitable TCCACMs have demonstrated their capability in substantially removing pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions. Test results showed that carbon adsorption, electrocoagulation, and electrofiltration respectively were all significant mechanisms for the removal of target pharmaceuticals. The adsorption behaviors related to CNFs on TCCACMs were also investigated in the present work.
