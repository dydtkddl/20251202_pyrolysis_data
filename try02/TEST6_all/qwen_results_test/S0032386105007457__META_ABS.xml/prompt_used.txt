You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

About morphology in ethylene–propylene(-diene) copolymers-based latexes Coatings and engineering plastics often require high impact strength. This property can be achieved with tougheners. For the present paper, core-shell impact modifiers were synthesized using ethylene–propylene copolymers (EPM), ethylene–propylene-diene copolymers (EPDM) or a mixture of both types (EP(D)M) as core material, as well as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as shell material. EP(D)M-based polymers were dispersed in water using an Ultra-Turrax® and a high pressure homogenizer. The prepared artificial latexes were used, either without further treatment or after crosslinking, as seed latexes in the emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The free radical seeded emulsion polymerization of MMA was investigated in the presence of an oil-soluble initiator, i.e. cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), combined with a redox system, i.e. sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate hydrate (SFS), disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4). This initiation system promotes polymerization of MMA near the surface of the seed particles, partially suppressing homogeneous secondary nucleation and polymerization in the aqueous phase. Kinetic and thermodynamic considerations were used to predict the particle morphology. The monomer type, the monomer-to-rubber ratio, the monomer feed type, and crosslinking of the seed latex particles were investigated, to optimize the polymerization kinetics and the properties of the resulting dispersions. The particle morphology was determined by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Monomer-flooded conditions led to the formation of inverted core-shell particles, whereas starved–feed MMA or MMA/styrene mixtures gave rise to partially engulfed structures, i.e. snowman-like. Crosslinking of the EP(D)M seed particles was found to be required to provide the desired core-shell structures. Finally, the obtained core-shell structured particles were used to toughen a PMMA matrix. The tensile properties of the modified PMMA matrix were investigated. The micro-morphology of modified PMMA was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tensile tests as well as TEM and SEM analyses demonstrated that the main mechanism of deformation operating in the EP(D)M-toughened PMMA matrix is shear yielding, accompanied by debonding and cavitation processes.
