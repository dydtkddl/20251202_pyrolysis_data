You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of different pre-treatments and addition of plastic on the properties of bio-oil obtained by pyrolysis of greenhouse crop residue The bio-oil properties and yields during pyrolysis at 400, 500 and 600 °C of the residues from the cultivation of the pepper in greenhouse (Capsicum annuum L.) were studied. Different solid samples were investigated: the biomass fraction of the residue, the water-washed biomass sample, the cobalt-loaded biomass sample and three mixtures made with the biomass and plastic fractions of the residue. Results showed that temperature of pyrolysis has a moderate impact on the products’ yields and bio-oil properties for all solid samples. In general, the highest bio-oil yield was achieved operating at 600 °C while the higher char yield was reached at 400 °C. The pH of all the bio-oil samples was low, specially bio-oil from the cobalt-loaded biomass sample. Density, viscosity, cetane number, average boiling temperature, flashpoint, elemental analysis and ash content of the samples were analyzed and compared. The highest higher heating value was achieved for bio-oil (4218.6 kcal/kg) obtained from pyrolysis of the cobalt-loaded biomass sample. Infrared spectra and chromatography analysis revealed the presence of numerous compounds. Acetic acid is the main acid component of the bio-oil samples obtained from the biomass, the water-washed biomass and the cobalt-loaded biomass, although there are some differences in relative area. Other compounds such as ketones, phenolic or furans were also found. In bio-oils obtained from biomass and plastic mixtures, in general there was a decrease in the content of oxygenated compounds and acidic compounds, favoring the presence of non-oxygenated compounds. This work shows the feasibility of the obtaining of bio-oil from the greenhouse crop residue at the temperature range between 400 and 600 °C.
