Facile preparation and properties of porous carbon from chlorinated polymer with high chlorine content Chlorinated polypropylene(CPP), chlorinated polyethylene(CPE) and chlorinated polyvinyl chloride(CPVC) with high chlorine content were used to prepare porous carbons under inert gas and air atmosphere, respectively. Due to their flame retardance, carbon materials were both prepared from two atmosphere through thermal dehydrochlorination. The microstructure and porous textures of the obtained carbons were characterized by BET, XPS, SEM, TEM, XRD and Raman, respectively. The results show that the dehydrochlorination of all precursors is more efficient in air than nitrogen, because the oxygen molecular in air atmosphere accelerates the elimination of hydrogen chloride(HCl). Moreover, CPP-derived carbons display apparent higher surface area than that derived from CPE and CPVC. Furthermore, the carbonization condition is optimized and porous carbon with a surface area of 1035 m2/g is prepared in mild carbonization condition and without any activation.
