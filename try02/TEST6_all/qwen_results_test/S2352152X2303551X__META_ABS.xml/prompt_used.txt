You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced strategies in electrode engineering and nanomaterial modifications for supercapacitor performance enhancement: A comprehensive review Supercapacitors are rapidly emerging as a pivotal energy storage technology due to their high-power density, fast charging/discharging capabilities, and long cyclic life. This extensive review sheds light on the integral components of supercapacitors, emphasizing electrode materials and the diverse substrates they are interfaced with. The careful selection of appropriate electrode materials, along with their preparation and coating techniques on compatible substrates, significantly influences the performance and cost of supercapacitors. Recent research efforts have focused on enhancing supercapacitor performance by modifying various substrates with nanomaterials. This review covers a range of supercapacitor substrates, including carbon-based substrates, indium tin oxide-coated glass, fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass, nickel foam, stainless steel, and aluminum foil, discussing their modification with various nanomaterials such as carbon-based materials, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, MOFs, COFs, MXenes, and conductive polymers. Techniques such as drop casting, electrochemical deposition, hydrothermal methods, and printing techniques are utilized for these modifications. The advantages and disadvantages of each substrate and modification process are examined, focusing on how nanomaterials impact energy storage capacity, power density, and cycling stability. Using nanomaterials increases electrode surface area, leading to higher energy density, while suitable substrates facilitate precise control over nanomaterial modifications, resulting in improved charge storage capabilities. By providing insights into the fundamental knowledge of supercapacitors and emphasizing the potential of nanomaterials and their modification methodologies on various substrates, this review paper offers valuable information for scientists and engineers in the field of energy storage.
