You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A UVA light-emitting diode microreactor for the photocatalytic degradation of humic acids and the control of disinfection by-products formation potential Chlorination is one of the most applied technologies for drinking water disinfection. However, the generation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in the chlorination process is threatening drinking water safety, especially when the concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) is high in source water. Climate change increases the fluctuation of NOM in source water, which further challenges water safety in small and rural communities. In this study, environmental microfluidics was introduced to a UVA-LED photocatalytic oxidation system for a rapid oxidation of NOM. The results showed that HA adsorption and degradation, and DOC degradation were more favored in low pH. At pH 5, 56.9% of HA and 58.1% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed in 3.4 min by the microreactor. DBP formation potential was efficiently reduced, with the highest reduction of THM and HAA formation potentials by 76% and 70.7%, respectively. Compared with the bottle reactor, the degradation rate constants of HA and DOC by UVA-LED microreactor were increased by 2.99 – 15.8 times, and 6.8 – 170.2 times, respectively. Homogenous irradiation and rapid mass transfer in the microreactor accelerated the inhibited oxidation of HA in acidic and base solutions and increased the apparent quantum yields of photocatalysis. Further, the microfluidic photocatalytic oxidation was much more efficient in the reduction of DPBs formation potential in a source water sample. The process was rapid and had low chemical and energy consumption. Approaches on system scale-up, system simplification, and energy conservation would increase potential of microfluidic photocatalytic oxidation in water purification for households and small communities.
