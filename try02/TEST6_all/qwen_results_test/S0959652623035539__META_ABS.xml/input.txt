A UVA light-emitting diode microreactor for the photocatalytic degradation of humic acids and the control of disinfection by-products formation potential Chlorination is one of the most applied technologies for drinking water disinfection. However, the generation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in the chlorination process is threatening drinking water safety, especially when the concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) is high in source water. Climate change increases the fluctuation of NOM in source water, which further challenges water safety in small and rural communities. In this study, environmental microfluidics was introduced to a UVA-LED photocatalytic oxidation system for a rapid oxidation of NOM. The results showed that HA adsorption and degradation, and DOC degradation were more favored in low pH. At pH 5, 56.9% of HA and 58.1% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed in 3.4 min by the microreactor. DBP formation potential was efficiently reduced, with the highest reduction of THM and HAA formation potentials by 76% and 70.7%, respectively. Compared with the bottle reactor, the degradation rate constants of HA and DOC by UVA-LED microreactor were increased by 2.99 – 15.8 times, and 6.8 – 170.2 times, respectively. Homogenous irradiation and rapid mass transfer in the microreactor accelerated the inhibited oxidation of HA in acidic and base solutions and increased the apparent quantum yields of photocatalysis. Further, the microfluidic photocatalytic oxidation was much more efficient in the reduction of DPBs formation potential in a source water sample. The process was rapid and had low chemical and energy consumption. Approaches on system scale-up, system simplification, and energy conservation would increase potential of microfluidic photocatalytic oxidation in water purification for households and small communities.
