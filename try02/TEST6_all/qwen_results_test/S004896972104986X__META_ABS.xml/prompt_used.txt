You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic waste into carbonaceous char: Priority of plastic waste management amidst COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 global pandemic, originated from Wuhan, resulted in a massive increase in the output of polypropylene (PP)-based personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. The continuous demand of PPE across the world caused the PP based plastic wastes accumulation. Some alternative approaches that have been practiced apart from collecting the plastic waste in the landfills are incineration approach and open burning. However, there were many drawbacks of these practices, which promote the release of chemical additives and greenhouse gases into the environment. Therefore, a proper approach in treating the plastic wastes, which introduces conversion of plastic wastes into renewable energy is paramount. Along the way of extensive research and studies, the recovery of PP plastic to fuel-like liquid oil and solid char through thermal decomposition of pyrolysis process, helps in reducing the number of PP plastic wastes and produces good quality pyrolysis liquid oil and solid char to be used in fuel applications. This paper summarizes the pyrolysis process for massively produced PP plastic wastes, type of pyrolysis used and the main pyrolysis parameters affecting the product yields. Literature studies of pyrolysis of PP plastic and several key points to optimize solid char production for PP were thoroughly elaborated in this review paper.
