You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics, artificial neural network modeling and environmental impact of coal gangue and biomass by TG-FTIR The harm done to the environment by coal gangue was very serious, and it is urgent to adopt effective methods to dispose of coal gangue in order to prevent further environmental damage. Co-pyrolysis experiments of coal gangue (CG) and peanut shell (PS) were carried out using thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) under nitrogen atmosphere. The heavy metal was detected using the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). CG and PS were mixed according to the mass ratio of 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1. The samples were heated to 1000 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C/min, 20 °C/min and 30 °C/min. The comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) of CG, C3P1, C1P1, C1P3 and PS is 0.17 × 10−8, 9.75 × 10−8, 35.47 × 10−8, 100.94 × 10−8 and 192.72 × 10−8%2 ·min−2·°C−3. The kinetic parameters were calculated by model-free methods (Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose). The gas products generated at different temperatures during the pyrolysis experiment were detected by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The heating rate, temperature and mixing ratio are the input parameters of artificial neural network (ANN), and the remaining mass percentage of sample during the pyrolysis is the output parameter. The ANN model was established and used to predict thermogravimetric experimental data. The ANN18 model is the best model for predicting the co-pyrolysis of CG and PS.
