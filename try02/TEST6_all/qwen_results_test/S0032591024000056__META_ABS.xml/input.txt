Super-quadric CFD-DEM modelling of chip-like particle-liquid flow in a rotary drum The rotary drum is a useful reactor in leaching processes, yet the internal multi-phase flow hydrodynamics still lacks detailed understanding, especially for chip-like particles. This work studies the transportation mechanism of chip-like particles in a particle-liquid rotary drum by the computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach where particle morphology is described by a super-quadric model. After model validations, the particle-scale information (e.g., active-passive interface, mixing, dispersion, orientation, and contact force) under different rotating speeds is analyzed. The results show that two anti-directional recirculation liquid vortexes are captured in the rotary drum due to the shear of the bed surface. The active depth, mixing degree, and axial particle dispersion increase with the rotating speed. Chip-like particles tend to orient their long axes parallel to the drum wall and drum axis. The fundamental study sheds light on the design and optimization of rotary drums for mixing and leaching processes.
