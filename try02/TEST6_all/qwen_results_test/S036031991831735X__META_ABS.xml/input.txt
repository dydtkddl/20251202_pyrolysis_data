Influences of equivalence ratio, oxygen concentration and fluidization velocity on the characteristics of oxygen-enriched gasification products from biomass in a pilot-scale fluidized bed The influences of equivalence ratio (ER), oxygen concentration (OC) and fluidization velocity (FV) on the gasification performance in a pilot-scale fluidized bed with capacity of 1 ton biomass (the mixture of agricultural residue) per day were investigated using oxygen-enriched air as gasification agent and high-alumina bauxite as bed material. The characteristics of syngas (lower heating value (LHV), gas yield (Y), carbon conversion (CC) and cold gas efficiency (CGE)), bio-char (LHV and Proximate analysis) and tar (tar yield and LHV) were used to evaluate the gasification performance in this study. The results showed that 0.161 was the optimal ER due to the high quality of syngas produced and relatively lower tar generation with ER changing from 0.115 to 0.243 at OC ≈ 40% and FV ≈ 1.20.29.7% was the optimal OC due to the highest Y and CC and relatively low tar generation when OC varied from 21% to 44.7% at ER ≈ 1.40 and FV ≈ 1.15. Although higher FV could improve syngas quality, it also resulted in the higher tar yield and heavier wear, therefore, the optimal gasification performance was achieved at moderate FV (FV = 1.13). This study proved that oxygen-enriched gasification in a large-scale fluidized bed was an effective option to produce gaseous biofuels with high quality.
