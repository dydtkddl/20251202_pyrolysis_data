You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of waste medical masks to light olefins in a two-stage process The treatment of waste plastics is currently one of the most urgent environmental issues, and disposable medical masks (DMMs) are becoming increasingly important in the recycling of waste plastics. This study employs thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectrometry (MS), and pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PyGC-MS) to investigate the thermal degradation of DMMs, including pyrolysis characteristics, kinetics, and products distribution. DMMs are composed of five layers, i.e., layers 1, 2 and 3 are the mask body, layer 4 is the mask strap, and layer 5 is the nose clip. Except layer 4, all the other layers could be entirely decomposed at 500 °C and have similar pyrolysis properties to PP. Alkanes, olefins, and diolefins with a wide carbon number distribution are produced at low temperature, while light olefins are more likely to be generated at high temperature. Accordingly, a two-stage pyrolysis reactor is applied to decompose DMMs to valuable products. After optimizing the operating conditions, the yield of light olefins reaches a maximum of 70.4 wt% at 800 °C in the second-stage pyrolysis of DMMs, where the yields of ethylene, propylene, and butene are 12.0 wt%, 28.0 wt%, and 29.6 wt%, respectively.
