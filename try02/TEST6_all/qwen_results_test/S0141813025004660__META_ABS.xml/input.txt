Microbial exopolysaccharides: Classification, biosynthetic pathway, industrial extraction and commercial production to unveil its bioprospection: A comprehensive review Polysaccharides, found universally in all living-species, exhibit diverse biochemical structures and play crucial roles in microorganisms, animals, and plants to defend against pathogens, environmental stress and climate-changing. Microbial exopolysaccharides are essential for cell adhesion and stress resilience and using them has notable advantages over synthetic polysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides have versatile structures and physicochemical properties, used in food systems, therapeutics, cosmetics, agriculture, and polymer industries. Immense economic and infrastructural constraints hinder its widespread commercial use, necessitating a deeper understanding of metabolic-pathways amidst changing environmental climate that influences the biomass composition of EPS-producing wild-microbes. Green and sustainable extraction of EPS from microbes followed by commercial product development has still not been exploited comprehensively. Yield of EPS production vary from 0.1 to 3 g/g of cell weight, influenced by fermentation conditions. Economic barriers, including substrate and processing costs, limit commercial viability. Key biosynthetic pathways involve glycosyltransferases enzymes, whose regulatory network gaps and substrate specificity remain areas for optimization. Addressing these could enhance yields and lower production costs. Review illustrates various microbial-exopolysaccharides, influencing factors of production, and offer valuable insights on the bioplastic, biofuel, agri-bioproduct, and biomedicine. But their bioprospecting potential is yet to be exhaustively explored, along with their pros and cons nor documented comprehensively in scientific literature.
