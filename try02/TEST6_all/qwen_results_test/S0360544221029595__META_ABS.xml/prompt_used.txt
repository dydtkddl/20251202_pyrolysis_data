You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of biochar from microwave pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch in an alumina susceptor Biomass-derived biochar emerges as a potential green bio-coal candidate for power generation. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis has been proven to be an efficient and economical technique for biomass conversion into biochar. The process can be further improved by utilising susceptor. This research focuses on producing biochar from microwave pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch (EFB) in an alumina susceptor. EFB pellet (PEFB) and EFB short fibre (FEFB) were pyrolysed in a 14 L bench scale microwave pyrolyser at temperatures between 200 and 400 °C. The pyrolyser performance (biochar yield, energy efficiency) and biochar properties (proximate analyses, ultimate analyses, calorific value and ash content) were analysed. The results showed that temperature of 300 °C demonstrated the optimised conditions for biochar production. FEFB produced 5.2% higher biochar yield and exhibited better biochar properties compared to PEFB. FEFB-derived biochar (FEFBC) overall characteristics were better than PEFB-derived biochar (PEFBC), with higher heating value (25.19 MJ/kg), fixed carbon (64.52%), volatile matter (13.38%) and carbon content (59.83%). However, FEFBC has high tendency of forming slagging and fouling in the combustor as the ash indexes were > 0.34 kg/GJ and RB/A > 1.75.
