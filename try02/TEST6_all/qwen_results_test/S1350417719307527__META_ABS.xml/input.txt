Intensified recovery of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates from wastewater-grown microalgae Desmodesmus sp. by using ultrasound or ozone This study evaluates the effect of ultrasound and ozone pretreatments for the subsequent recovery of Desmodesmus sp. biocomponents—lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates—using a response surface methodology. Both pretreatments impact on the recovered lipids quality, solvent waste production and extraction time is analysed for process intensification purposes. For ultrasound pretreatment, independent parameters were energy applied (50–200 kWh/kg dry biomass), biomass concentration (25–75 g/L), and ultrasonic intensity (0.32 and 0.53 W/mL). While for ozone pretreatment, independent parameters were ozone concentration (3–9 mg O3/L), biomass concentration (25–75 g/L), and contact time (5–15 min). In the case of ultrasound pretreatment, recovery yield reached 97 ± 0.4%, 89 ± 3%, and 73 ± 0.6% for proteins, carbohydrates and lipids respectively. Given process required: energy applied of 50 kWh/kg dry biomass, 75 g/L of biomass concentration, 0.32 W/mL of ultrasonic intensity, and 56 min of time process. Ultrasound caused high cell disruption releasing all proteins, thereby obviating downstream processing for its recovery. Ozone pretreatment recovery yield was 85 ± 2%, 48 ± 1.4%, and 25 ± 1.3%, for carbohydrates, lipids and proteins respectively, under the following conditions: 9 mg O3/L of ozone concentration, 25 g/L of biomass concentration, and 5 min of contact time that depicts an energy consumption of 30.64 kWh/kg dry biomass. It was found that ultrasound and ozone pretreatments intensified the lysis and biocomponents recovery process by reducing solvent consumption by at least 92% and extraction time between 80% and 90% compared with extraction of untreated biomass biocomponents. Both pretreatments improve the composition of the recovered lipids. It was noted that the yield of neutral lipids increased from 28% to 67% for ultrasound pretreatment while for ozone pretreatment from 49% to 63%. The method used for lipid extraction may also have an effect but here it was kept constant.
