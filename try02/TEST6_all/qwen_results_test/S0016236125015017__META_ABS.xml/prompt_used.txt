You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of refrigerator plastic waste by pyrolysis: Yields, product composition, and potential applications Recycling is crucial for sustainable resource management including heterogeneous and contaminated waste fractions such as those derived from composite materials. This study examines the potential application of pyrolysis of a plastic-rich heterogeneous fraction from an advanced mechanical recycling cascade of refrigerators as a representative example of challenging waste streams from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Advanced spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques are used for feedstock and pyrolysis product characterization. A screw reactor on pilot-scale is used to derive pyrolysis mass balances and to evaluate product yields. The organic condensate with a yield of 64 wt% is rich in styrene and lower aromatics. After further upgrading and separation, aromatic base chemicals and other fractions derived from the organic condensate could substitute fossil feedstocks in the chemical industry. The gas fraction yielding 13 wt% could also be suitable for producing basic chemicals after post-processing. Solid residues enriched with fillers and metals which account for 19 wt% of the pyrolysis products offer recycling opportunities although detailed concepts for pollutant removal and filler reuse remain to be validated. This study highlights the potential of pyrolysis for chemically recycling heterogeneous plastic-rich waste by presenting insights into feedstock and pyrolysis product characterization and by indicating sustainable recycling pathways.
