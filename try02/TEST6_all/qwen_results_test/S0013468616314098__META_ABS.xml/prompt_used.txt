You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nitrogen- and oxygen-codoped porous carbonaceous foam templated from high internal emulsion as PtRu catalyst support for direct methanol fuel cell In this study, preparation of nitrogen- and oxygen-codoped porous carbonaceous foam and its application as metal nanoparticles catalysts support for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) were presented. Tadpole-like single chain polymer nanoparticles stabilized water-in-acrylonitrile/divinyl benezene high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) was firstly prepared, and the formed HIPE was then converted into polymer of high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPE) through a radical polymerization reaction. Subsequently, the formed acrylonitrile/divinyl benezene based polyHIPE was hypercrosslinked via FeCl3 catalyzed Friedel-Crafts reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane. After pyrolysis of the hypercrosslinked polyHIPE at elevated temperature under N2 atmosphere, nitrogen- and oxygen-codoped porous carbonaceous foam exhibiting highly interconnected macroporous cells and a micro-/mesoporous carbon skeleton (carboHIPE) was obtained. The resultant carboHIPE was further applied as the support for Pt and Ru bimetal nanoparticles. Well-dispersed PtRu bimetal nanoparticles with a smaller size were perfectly dispersed on the surface of carboHIPE in the form of alloy phase. The PtRu alloy nanoparticles decorated carboHIPE (PtRu/carboHIPE) demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performances towards the methanol electrooxidation by comparison with Pt/carboHIPE and commercial PtRu/C with almost same Pt content, such as the higher current density, the better long term stability and the improved CO-resistance.
