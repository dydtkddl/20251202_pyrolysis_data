Nitrogen- and oxygen-codoped porous carbonaceous foam templated from high internal emulsion as PtRu catalyst support for direct methanol fuel cell In this study, preparation of nitrogen- and oxygen-codoped porous carbonaceous foam and its application as metal nanoparticles catalysts support for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) were presented. Tadpole-like single chain polymer nanoparticles stabilized water-in-acrylonitrile/divinyl benezene high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) was firstly prepared, and the formed HIPE was then converted into polymer of high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPE) through a radical polymerization reaction. Subsequently, the formed acrylonitrile/divinyl benezene based polyHIPE was hypercrosslinked via FeCl3 catalyzed Friedel-Crafts reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane. After pyrolysis of the hypercrosslinked polyHIPE at elevated temperature under N2 atmosphere, nitrogen- and oxygen-codoped porous carbonaceous foam exhibiting highly interconnected macroporous cells and a micro-/mesoporous carbon skeleton (carboHIPE) was obtained. The resultant carboHIPE was further applied as the support for Pt and Ru bimetal nanoparticles. Well-dispersed PtRu bimetal nanoparticles with a smaller size were perfectly dispersed on the surface of carboHIPE in the form of alloy phase. The PtRu alloy nanoparticles decorated carboHIPE (PtRu/carboHIPE) demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performances towards the methanol electrooxidation by comparison with Pt/carboHIPE and commercial PtRu/C with almost same Pt content, such as the higher current density, the better long term stability and the improved CO-resistance.
