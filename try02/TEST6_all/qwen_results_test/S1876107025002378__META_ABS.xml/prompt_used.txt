You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of polypropylene into valued-added gasoline range hydrocarbons by catalytic pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure: different composite catalysts of HZSM-5, HY and MCM-41 Background The synergic effect of textural and acidity properties of zeolite composite catalysts needs to be investigated, to improve catalyst design for plastic pyrolysis. The proximity of the acid sites of the catalysts can increase accessibility and reduce the diffusion limitation of macromolecules, improving the performance of zeolite catalysts. Methods In this study, polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis was studied over different zeolites (ZSM-5, HY, and MCM-41) and their diverse composites in a dual-bed fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The parent catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method and two techniques (granular mixing and powder mixing) were applied to prepare the composite catalysts. The structure and acidity of the catalysts were characterized by FE-SEM, XRD, BET-BJH, NH3-TPD, FT-IR, and TGA techniques. Significant Findings The catalysts included a uniform morphology, high crystallinity, high surface area (>360 m2g−1), and mesopore structure. The MCM-41/HY composite catalyst had superior catalytic performance in both forms of granular mixing and powder mixing. The highest amount of gasoline hydrocarbons (76.6 %) was achieved by the powder mixing, including olefin (28.3 %), paraffin (1.7 %), isoparaffin (8 %), aromatic (5.6 %), and cyclo compounds (32.4 %). The developed catalyst showed high stability, reusability, and low coke tendency. Furthermore, high activity was achieved in the pyrolysis of real PP waste plastic. The composite catalysts offer improved shape selectivity and porosity, reducing the diffusion limitation of macromolecules and leading to high activity in multi-step/cascade reactions. The results confirmed the high potential of the zeolite composite catalysts in catalytic pyrolysis of PP.
