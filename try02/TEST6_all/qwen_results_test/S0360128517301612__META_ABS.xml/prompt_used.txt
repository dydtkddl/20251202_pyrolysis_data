You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in the synthesis and modification of carbon-based 2D materials for application in energy conversion and storage Graphene, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and derived materials have emerged as promising solutions for applications in renewable energy storage/conversion devices. No alternatives are known to simultaneously exhibit large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, high mechanical strength and flexibility. This review article is a collection of some of the most relevant research efforts published in the last few years focusing on the synthesis and modification of graphene/rGO as well as doped and hybrid bi-dimensional carbon materials. For research on graphene growth, the choice of precursor and physical state (gas, solid or liquid) has been proved to be as important as the environment and synthesis approach. On the other hand, research focused on graphene oxide reduction has relied on the development of simple and efficient techniques for rGO conversion and device structuring. Modifications applied to graphene (during synthesis) or rGO (during reduction) have included doping, decoration with nanoparticles and the formation of composite microstructures. Fabrication of electrodes based on graphene/rGO for application in energy storage and conversion has been reported, including relevant performance data from real devices (supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, fuel cells or solar cells). This review concludes with a brief discussion of some of the possible directions for promising research in the area of graphene/rGO fabrication for energy conversion and storage devices.
