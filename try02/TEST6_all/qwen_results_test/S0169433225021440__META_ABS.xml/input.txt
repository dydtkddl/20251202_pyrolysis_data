Sustainable adsorbents for wastewater treatment: Comparative study of commercial and potassium hydroxide-activated carbon for crystal violet dye removal Industrial wastewater containing synthetic dyes like crystal violet (CV) poses significant environmental and health risks. This study presents a comparative evaluation of commercial activated carbon (CAC) and a novel activated carbon (PAC9A) derived from industrial mixed plastic char (PC) and activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH). The adsorption performance of both adsorbents was assessed under varying conditions, including pH, contact time, dosage, and dye concentration. Adsorption data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics, indicating monolayer adsorption and chemisorption mechanism. Under optimal conditions (pH 8, 120 min, 10 mg dosage, 50–200 mg L−1 CV), PAC9A achieved a maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity of 1086 mg g−1, while CAC reached 1772 mg g−1. Despite CAC’s higher capacity, PAC9A demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining 70 % removal efficiency over five cycles. These results highlight PAC9A’s potential as a sustainable, cost-effective alternative for dye remediation, promoting waste valorization and environmental sustainability. This work contributes to the development of efficient adsorbents from waste materials for practical wastewater treatment applications.
