You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular nitrogen from coal pyrolysis: Kinetic modelling It has been shown that molecular nitrogen (N2) in natural gas accumulations can result from thermal maturation of coal and other forms of sedimentary organic matter. The present paper investigates the loss of coal nitrogen in the late stage of coalification and the genesis of N2 from coal nitrogen in studying N2 evolution during programmed pyrolysis of a coal series ranking until meta-anthracite. The work confirms the decrease of nitrogen content already observed in the late stage of coalification. This late decrease is correlated with a relative increase of the N2 content in the total gas emitted by pyrolysis. N2 emission occurs above 600°C in two broad peaks. Assuming that the rate of denitrogenation is described by single first-order reactions with a single pre-exponential factor, a discrete distribution of activation energies is computed by data processing of the first nitrogen peak of a representative semi-anthracite coal (Ro 2.3%). Activation energies are distributed between 65 and 80 kcal/mol with a mode at 72 kcal/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 7.71 × 1012 s−1. Similar values have been obtained by other authors for the thermal decomposition of pyridine. These kinetic parameters are used to predict the N2 genesis in the Centre Broad Fourteens Basin (southern North Sea). The model indicates that Carboniferous anthracites in this basin could have released up to 0.575 m3 of N2 per ton of carbon.
