You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Supercritical fluid extraction for purification of waxes derived from polyethylene and polypropylene plastics Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) feedstock contain various additives, such as fillers and colorants, which either degrade or carry through the depolymerization process; thereby causing intense dark colors and a pungent petroleum odor. The combination of color and odor imposes several challenges, limiting the potential markets of the wax products. This study put emphasis on the development of an innovative and environmentally sustainable process based on supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) to remove organic and inorganic contaminants that cause color and odor in waxes derived from recycled polymers. In terms of organic impurity removal, for PE 81% and for PP 97% removal efficiency was achieved. The color of PE and PP in terms of lightness under CIELAB (lightness, green-red, blue-yellow) color space was improved by 13 and 40 units, respectively. The purified waxes could be utilized in a variety of market segments, including color masterbatch, roofing shingles, rubber, and coatings. Compared with traditional purification technologies based on solvent extraction and absorbent filters, SCFE process offers exceptional advantages, including fast reaction rates, little liquid waste, ease of separation of solutes, and fewer separation stages. This novel process enables producing high-value water white waxes from reclaimed polymeric feedstock with a focus on clean technologies and enhanced resource efficiency.
