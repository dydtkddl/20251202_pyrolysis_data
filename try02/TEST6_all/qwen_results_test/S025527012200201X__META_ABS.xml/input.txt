A critical review on solid waste treatment using plasma pyrolysis technology Solid waste management has received attention due to the rise in per capita waste generation worldwide. The widespread impact on the environment is notably high due to improper waste management. Currently, solid wastes are managed by different techniques over which, plasma pyrolysis seems advantageous due to its environment-safe processing, production of high-quality syngas/hydrogen, and a significant reduction in solid residue. Plasma pyrolysis technology converts solid wastes to energy by thermo-chemical processing in absence of oxygen. It offers a sustainable waste management option with minimal amount of harmful emissions. This review focuses merely on the current status of plasma pyrolysis technology. It critically reviews the research carried out on plasma pyrolysis technology for the treatment of a wide range of solid wastes, including hazardous waste. The compositions and applications of solid residue and syngas generated from plasma pyrolysis process are also incorporated. The plasma reactor designs and plasma generation sources are also investigated. A study of cost estimation to process different wastes is also presented. Furthermore, the challenges of this technology and recommended actions are also identified to make this technology a viable option on a larger scale. Plasma pyrolysis is a state-of-the-art technology that offers a promising future for effective treatment of solid waste.
