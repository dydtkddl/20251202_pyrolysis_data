You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on solid waste treatment using plasma pyrolysis technology Solid waste management has received attention due to the rise in per capita waste generation worldwide. The widespread impact on the environment is notably high due to improper waste management. Currently, solid wastes are managed by different techniques over which, plasma pyrolysis seems advantageous due to its environment-safe processing, production of high-quality syngas/hydrogen, and a significant reduction in solid residue. Plasma pyrolysis technology converts solid wastes to energy by thermo-chemical processing in absence of oxygen. It offers a sustainable waste management option with minimal amount of harmful emissions. This review focuses merely on the current status of plasma pyrolysis technology. It critically reviews the research carried out on plasma pyrolysis technology for the treatment of a wide range of solid wastes, including hazardous waste. The compositions and applications of solid residue and syngas generated from plasma pyrolysis process are also incorporated. The plasma reactor designs and plasma generation sources are also investigated. A study of cost estimation to process different wastes is also presented. Furthermore, the challenges of this technology and recommended actions are also identified to make this technology a viable option on a larger scale. Plasma pyrolysis is a state-of-the-art technology that offers a promising future for effective treatment of solid waste.
