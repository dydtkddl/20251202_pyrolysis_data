You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of synergetic, kinetics, thermodynamics, and batch studies of polypropylene-bakelite co-pyrolysis This study explores the co-pyrolysis recycling of the Polypropylene-Bakelite blend to improve the kinetics, thermodynamics, and conversion of thermal degradation of bakelite into useful products. The thermogravimetry analysis of the blend was conducted from ambient to 1000 °C at various heating rates in an N2 atmosphere. Thermogravimetric-Differential thermogravimetry curves revealed four steps of pyrolytic degradation, including two major weight loss steps (220–420 °C and 420–550 °C). The blending of polypropylene with Bakelite caused a shift in the pyrolytic degradation temperature zone and a synergetic effect. The pyrolytic degradation of the blended sample followed the F3 order-based mechanism with an average activation energy of 151 kJ/mol at 220–420 °C and the P3/2 nucleation mechanism with an average activation energy of 306 kJ/mol at 420–550 °C. The blend produced 47.66 % oil, 11.1 % wax, 15.1 % residue, and 26.14 % non-condensable gas during batch pyrolysis at 450 °C. The Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analyses revealed that the oil contained 18.86 % saturated hydrocarbons (C8-54), 20.33 % unsaturated hydrocarbons (C7-19), and 60.81 % oxygenated compounds (C9-41) that could be used as transportation fuel.
