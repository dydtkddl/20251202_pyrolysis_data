You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-stage thermal pyrolysis of plastic solid waste: Set-up and operative conditions investigation for gaseous fuel production In response to the escalating global challenge of mounting plastic waste and the imperative to adopt more sustainable practices for resource utilization, our study focuses on the utilization of plastic solid waste (PSW) through a two-stage thermal pyrolysis process. This aims to demonstrate its potential as a high-performance alternative to existing two-stage catalytic pyrolysis methods. The experimentation involved processing real scrap PSW material in a lab-scale batch set-up, emphasizing optimizing residence time in the cracking reactor to maximize gas yield and its lower heating value (LHV). The study underscores the advantages of the employed two-stage thermal pyrolysis apparatus through a comparative analysis with established set-up dedicated to maximizing gas yield. Once the operative conditions were explored, resulting pyrolysis products underwent detailed characterization to assess their suitability as a sustainable fuel source. The study also presents a practical application of the produced gaseous fuel, envisioning its combustion in an internal combustion engine (ICE), known for its flexibility regarding fuel properties. This application is demonstrated through a simulation conducted in Unisim Design©. The successful processing of real PSW material in the two-stage lab-scale experimental set-up showcased optimal gas yield achievements (>65 % w/w) with an LHV (∼41 MJ/kg), comparable to that of natural gas. This emphasizes the potential of these sustainable alternatives to replace fossil fuels, especially in the context of ICE applications. The integration of the pyrolysis plant with an ICE demonstrated promising prospects for generating electricity in the transportation sector and facilitating thermal power for heat integration in pyrolysis reactors.
