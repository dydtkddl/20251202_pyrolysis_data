Status and challenges of applications and industry chain technologies of hydrogen in the context of carbon neutrality The year 2022 is the seventh year since the Paris Agreement was signed. In the context of the same goals of achieving carbon neutrality and transforming the energy structure, hydrogen has become one of the most appealing options for realizing a better vision. This paper reviews the status and challenges of hydrogen application paths in high carbon emission sectors, especially in the electricity and heating, transportation, and steel industries. The discussions focus on the potential contribution from the replacement of primary energy and the reduction in carbon emission by switching to a hydrogen economy. In the case of China in 2030, the application of hydrogen in a single sector is expected to save up to $27.8 billion in carbon tax. Additionally, the key technologies for hydrogen production, storage, and carbon footprint in the industry chain are discussed. In contrast, the cost-effective blue hydrogen is still the best choice. The hydrogen storage technologies suitable for large-scale and low energy consumption need to be broken through. The study of carbon footprint in the industry chain will promote the development of hydrogen in the designated sectors and provide insights for the policy decision on hydrogen development at the regional or industrial level.
