You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Status and challenges of applications and industry chain technologies of hydrogen in the context of carbon neutrality The year 2022 is the seventh year since the Paris Agreement was signed. In the context of the same goals of achieving carbon neutrality and transforming the energy structure, hydrogen has become one of the most appealing options for realizing a better vision. This paper reviews the status and challenges of hydrogen application paths in high carbon emission sectors, especially in the electricity and heating, transportation, and steel industries. The discussions focus on the potential contribution from the replacement of primary energy and the reduction in carbon emission by switching to a hydrogen economy. In the case of China in 2030, the application of hydrogen in a single sector is expected to save up to $27.8 billion in carbon tax. Additionally, the key technologies for hydrogen production, storage, and carbon footprint in the industry chain are discussed. In contrast, the cost-effective blue hydrogen is still the best choice. The hydrogen storage technologies suitable for large-scale and low energy consumption need to be broken through. The study of carbon footprint in the industry chain will promote the development of hydrogen in the designated sectors and provide insights for the policy decision on hydrogen development at the regional or industrial level.
