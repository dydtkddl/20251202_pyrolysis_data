You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding carbonaceous deposit formation resulting from engine oil degradation The formation processes of carbonaceous deposits in the first piston ring grooves of direct injection diesel engines have been studied. Deposits generated during engine tests were analysed by SEM/EDX, thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and FT-IR spectroscopy. These analyses showed that the deposits, with a structure of cracked varnishes, mainly resulted from the degradation of lubricants. Their state strongly depends on the severity of the tests, which resulted in the formation of two kinds of deposits, termed as ‘oily’ and ‘dry’, according to their content of volatile organic matters. Then, to better understand the deposit formation process, a thermo-oxidative degradation of the lubricating oil was carried out in a tubular furnace, while varying temperature, duration of the test, and adding metallic elements to simulate the engine wear. The consumption of antioxidant additives and the lubricant carbonization were highlighted. Temperature level was identified as the most influential parameter during the lubricant degradation process. The presence of metallic elements appeared to act as a catalyst by speeding up the degradation when the tests duration was increased.
