You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of seawater aging on the pyrolysis of fishing nets This study examined the effects of seawater aging on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis behavior of nylon-6 (N6) and polyethylene (PE) using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The analyses revealed an increase in the contents of fixed carbon and ash in both N6 and PE due to aging in seawater for five months. FT-IR spectroscopy indicated an increase in the content of the hydroxyl group in the structures of both aged N6 and PE, suggesting their partial decomposition and oxidation during seawater aging. TGA showed that the maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax) and pyrolysis kinetic parameters of N6, such as the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, were changed by seawater aging. Although the Tmax of PE did not change significantly with seawater aging, the differential thermogravimetric peak shape and kinetic parameters of PE were changed by seawater aging. The isothermal Py-GC/MS results at 600 °C showed that aged N6 produced 3-amino-pentanol in addition to the typical pyrolyzates of fresh N6. Furthermore, the pyrogram of aged PE was similar to that of fresh PE.
