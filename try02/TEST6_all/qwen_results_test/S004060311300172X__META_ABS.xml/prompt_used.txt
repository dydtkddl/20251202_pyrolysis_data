You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of Cu-nanofibers and Ag-nanoparticles on syndiotactic polystyrene thermal stability and on its decomposition mechanism In this research, syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) based nanocomposites containing 3wt% of Cu-nanofibers and Ag-nanoparticles were prepared using the melt-mixing technique. TEM and SEM micrographs verified a fine dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymeric matrix. Tensile testing experiments showed slight improvement of the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites, compared to neat sPS. From the thermogravimetric analysis a substantial enhancement of sPS thermal stability was found, caused by the addition of nanofillers. The temperature corresponding to a mass loss of 0.5% is 295°C for the sPS, 344.5°C for the sPS–Cu and 361.8°C for the sPS–Ag nanocomposites. The activation energy of thermal decomposition is 152.5 for sPS, 177.8 for sPS–Cu nanofibers and 198.7kJ/mol for sPS–Ag nanoparticles. From pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (Py-GC–MS) study of sPS and its nanocomposites, it was found that even though the nanocomposite materials are more stable than sPS, the decomposition mechanism remains the same. Also, the main decomposition products of all materials under study were found to be styrene, its dimmer and trimmers.
