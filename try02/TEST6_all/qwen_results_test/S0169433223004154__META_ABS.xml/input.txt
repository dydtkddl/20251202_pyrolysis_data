Construction of 3DOM Fe2O3/CuO heterojunction nanomaterials for enhanced AP decomposition The construction of ordered pore structure and heterostructure interface is considered as an effective strategy to optimize the activity and stability of nano catalysts. Herein, we have elaborately fabricated the p-n heterostructure nanocatalysts of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) Fe2O3-supported 2D copper oxide nanofilm using a simple impregnation method, abbreviated as 3DOM-Fe2O3/CuO. The prepared 3DOM Fe2O3/CuO shows interconnected and ordered macroporous channels, which provide considerable catalytic active sites and enrich the reactive oxygen concentration at the Fe2O3-CuO heterostructure interface. By adjusting the copper source concentration, 2D copper oxide nanofilm with varied thicknesses was introduced to readily regulate the morphology of the catalyst and the atom composition or electronic structure of the interface. When evaluated as a catalyst for ammonium perchlorate (AP) decomposition reaction, 3DOM-Fe2O3/CuO-3 testified the most satisfactory catalytic activity, reducing the high temperature decomposition peak of AP decreased by 105.27 °C and the decomposition activation energy (Ea) by 50 %. Based on the experimental results of this study and related theoretical researches, the following mechanisms are proposed: in the thermal decomposition process of AP, the generation of active oxygen is not only related to the active oxygen mechanism, but also may be related to the NO2-assisted mechanism.
