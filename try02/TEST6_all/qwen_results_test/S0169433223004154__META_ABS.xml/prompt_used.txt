You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Construction of 3DOM Fe2O3/CuO heterojunction nanomaterials for enhanced AP decomposition The construction of ordered pore structure and heterostructure interface is considered as an effective strategy to optimize the activity and stability of nano catalysts. Herein, we have elaborately fabricated the p-n heterostructure nanocatalysts of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) Fe2O3-supported 2D copper oxide nanofilm using a simple impregnation method, abbreviated as 3DOM-Fe2O3/CuO. The prepared 3DOM Fe2O3/CuO shows interconnected and ordered macroporous channels, which provide considerable catalytic active sites and enrich the reactive oxygen concentration at the Fe2O3-CuO heterostructure interface. By adjusting the copper source concentration, 2D copper oxide nanofilm with varied thicknesses was introduced to readily regulate the morphology of the catalyst and the atom composition or electronic structure of the interface. When evaluated as a catalyst for ammonium perchlorate (AP) decomposition reaction, 3DOM-Fe2O3/CuO-3 testified the most satisfactory catalytic activity, reducing the high temperature decomposition peak of AP decreased by 105.27 °C and the decomposition activation energy (Ea) by 50 %. Based on the experimental results of this study and related theoretical researches, the following mechanisms are proposed: in the thermal decomposition process of AP, the generation of active oxygen is not only related to the active oxygen mechanism, but also may be related to the NO2-assisted mechanism.
