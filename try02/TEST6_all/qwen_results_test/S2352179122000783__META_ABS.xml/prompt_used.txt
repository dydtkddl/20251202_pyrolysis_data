You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Properties and thermal neutron areal transmittance of a B4C filled thermoplastic elastomer based rubber composite In this paper, a kind of flexible shield for thermal neutron is fabricated through blending functional B4C powder with thermoplastic elastomer polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene(SEBS) in a banbury mixer, and weight fractions[(MB4C: MSEBS)%] of the composites are prepared as 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 60%, 100% respectively. B4C powders are well dispersed in the matrix of SEBS through microscopic observation, even without chemical interaction between the chemical groups of SEBS and the fillers. The elongations at break and tensile strengths of the B4C/SEBS composites deteriorate rapidly compared with the virgin sample, but it seems the tensile and tear strength could still maintain a satisfactory value suitable for preparing super flexible shields. The hardness of the composites is in the range of 15–25 HA. Based on a self developed nondestructive testing device, shielding abilities of the samples are estimated by neutron transmittance, 10B areal density, linear attenuation coefficient, and thickness of half value layer. The neutron transmittance is 71.31%–32.43% corresponding to 10B areal density ranging from 2.1873 mg/cm2 to 17.6314 mg/cm2, linear attenuation coefficient is 0.1932–0.6435 mm−1, and half value layer value is 3.59–1.08 mm. It is also proved that the neutron transmittance measured shows an exponential attenuation with the increase of 10B areal density. The most importantly, the areal uniformity of neutron transmittance, with standard deviation less than 0.76%, is validated for the achievement of excellent attenuation of thermal neutrons in all directions. Consequently, results show excellent flexible and shielding performances of the functional composites.
