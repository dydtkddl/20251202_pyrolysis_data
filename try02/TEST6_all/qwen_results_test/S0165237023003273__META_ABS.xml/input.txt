The effect of citric acid pretreatment on composition and stability of bio-oil from sugar cane residues using a continuous lab-scale pyrolysis reactor This study outlines the effect of citric acid leaching on the quality and stability of fast pyrolysis bio-oils from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and sugarcane trash (SCT). The quality of bio-oil was probed by GC-MS analysis, elemental composition, higher heating value, water and solids content, pH, dynamic viscosity and stability (ageing). Pyrolysis was performed at 500 °C in a fully controlled, continuously operated plant with a biomass throughput of ca. 300 g.hr−1. While citric acid leaching causes a decrease of the average bio-oil yield with 5%, it does not lead to a bio-oil with improved fuel-related properties. However, the bio-oil composition became more advantageous in light of its biorefining. Indeed, citric acid leaching led to an increased levoglucosan concentration – a promising platform chemical – of 17% for SCB and of to 35% for SCT (based on relative abundance in GC-MS). In tandem, the concentration of carboxylic acids and phenols in the bio-oil decreased after citric acid leaching, which is beneficial for downstream purification of levoglucosan. Regarding the non-condensable gases, CO and CO2 represented between 88% and 91% by weight of the total non-condensable gases produced in pyrolysis. Therefore, the results of this study demonstrate that optimized biomass demineralization pretreatment with citric acid could produce bio-oil at high yield and rich in high-value chemical compounds like levoglucosan. Biomass demineralization pretreatment however, does not result in bio-oil with improved quality for fuel purposes, nor does it necessarily lead to bio-oil having higher stability.
