You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integration of sustainable polymers with phase change materials Sustainable polymers are expected to alleviate the dual pressure of energy and environment when integrated with advanced phase change material (PCM) systems, hence promoting carbon neutrality goals. The excellent intrinsic properties and flexible designability of sustainable polymers also enable them to demonstrate competitiveness in the preparation of cutting-edge phase-change composites. However, the integration methods, structure-performance relationships, and recycling technologies of these emerging form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) have been hardly reviewed. Herein, we systematically summarize the recent progress of sustainable polymer-based FSPCMs including the preparation from bio-based chemicals to polymers, encapsulation strategy of PCMs, upgrade methods, performance influencing factors, multi-energy utilization, and advanced applications. Meanwhile, we also concluded the design methodologies and recovery strategies of recyclable polymer FSPCMs and provided in-depth insights into their efficient recycling. In addition, we proposed the analysis results and optimization strategies for two key technical parameters, crystallization fraction and thermal stability. Finally, a research perspective was presented to highlight the emerging research directions of green FSPCMs throughout the lifecycle. This review hopefully provides guidance for the design and upgrading of sustainable polymer-based phase-change composites from high performance/multifunction to recycling and inspires in-depth research on the structure-performance relationships.
