Integration of sustainable polymers with phase change materials Sustainable polymers are expected to alleviate the dual pressure of energy and environment when integrated with advanced phase change material (PCM) systems, hence promoting carbon neutrality goals. The excellent intrinsic properties and flexible designability of sustainable polymers also enable them to demonstrate competitiveness in the preparation of cutting-edge phase-change composites. However, the integration methods, structure-performance relationships, and recycling technologies of these emerging form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) have been hardly reviewed. Herein, we systematically summarize the recent progress of sustainable polymer-based FSPCMs including the preparation from bio-based chemicals to polymers, encapsulation strategy of PCMs, upgrade methods, performance influencing factors, multi-energy utilization, and advanced applications. Meanwhile, we also concluded the design methodologies and recovery strategies of recyclable polymer FSPCMs and provided in-depth insights into their efficient recycling. In addition, we proposed the analysis results and optimization strategies for two key technical parameters, crystallization fraction and thermal stability. Finally, a research perspective was presented to highlight the emerging research directions of green FSPCMs throughout the lifecycle. This review hopefully provides guidance for the design and upgrading of sustainable polymer-based phase-change composites from high performance/multifunction to recycling and inspires in-depth research on the structure-performance relationships.
