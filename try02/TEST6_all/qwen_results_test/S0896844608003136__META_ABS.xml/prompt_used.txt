You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impregnation of a biocompatible polymer aided by supercritical CO2: Evaluation of drug stability and drug–matrix interactions Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was loaded with 2-acetyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid (triflusal) by using a supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) impregnation method. The main objective of this work was to provide information for the infusion of additives into nonporous polymeric substrates for design of sustained release systems. Chemical and H-bonding interactions between the matrix and the infused drug were evaluated together with the impregnated drug stability. The composition of the obtained systems was characterized by 1H magnetic nuclear resonance and liquid chromatography. The microstructure of the impregnated matrix was studied using thermal analysis. The affinity of the solute to the polymer was explored via attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Finally, an in vitro elution method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was used to evaluate the release behavior of prepared formulations. Loadings of ca. 20wt% of active agent in PMMA were obtained, while the drug crystallization was avoided. From a pharmaceutical point of view, the impregnated samples had an excellent potential for the preparation of sustained formulations, since the delivery profiles were consistent with keeping stable levels of the drug over a long period of time.
