A review of the next-generation biochar production from waste biomass for material applications The development of carbonaceous materials such as biochar has triggered a hot spot in materials application. Carbon material derived from biomass could be a vital platform for energy storage and conversion. Biochar-based materials deliver a novel approach to deal with the current energy-related challenges. To design and utilize the maximum potential of biochar for environmentally sustainable applications, it is crucial to understand the recent progress and advancement in molecular structures of biochar to discover a new possible field to simplify structural application networks. However, most of the studies demonstrated the application of biochar in the form of soil enhancers and bio-adsorbents, reducing soil emissions of greenhouse gases and as fertilizers. The present review on biochar highlighted the application of biochar-based materials in various energy storage and conversion sectors, comprising different types of conversion technologies, biochar formation mechanisms, modification techniques on biochar surface chemistry and its functionality, catalysts, biochar application in energy storage gadgets such as supercapacitors and nanotubes, bio-based composite materials and inorganic based composites materials. Finally, this review addressed some vital outlooks on the prospect of the functionalization and best utilization of biochar-supported materials in numerous energy storage and conversion fields. After reviewing the literature, it was directed that advanced and in-depth research is essential for structural analysis and separation, considering the macroscopic and microscopic evidence of the formed structural design of biochar for specific applications.
