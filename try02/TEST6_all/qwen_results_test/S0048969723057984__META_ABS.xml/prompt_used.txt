You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of the next-generation biochar production from waste biomass for material applications The development of carbonaceous materials such as biochar has triggered a hot spot in materials application. Carbon material derived from biomass could be a vital platform for energy storage and conversion. Biochar-based materials deliver a novel approach to deal with the current energy-related challenges. To design and utilize the maximum potential of biochar for environmentally sustainable applications, it is crucial to understand the recent progress and advancement in molecular structures of biochar to discover a new possible field to simplify structural application networks. However, most of the studies demonstrated the application of biochar in the form of soil enhancers and bio-adsorbents, reducing soil emissions of greenhouse gases and as fertilizers. The present review on biochar highlighted the application of biochar-based materials in various energy storage and conversion sectors, comprising different types of conversion technologies, biochar formation mechanisms, modification techniques on biochar surface chemistry and its functionality, catalysts, biochar application in energy storage gadgets such as supercapacitors and nanotubes, bio-based composite materials and inorganic based composites materials. Finally, this review addressed some vital outlooks on the prospect of the functionalization and best utilization of biochar-supported materials in numerous energy storage and conversion fields. After reviewing the literature, it was directed that advanced and in-depth research is essential for structural analysis and separation, considering the macroscopic and microscopic evidence of the formed structural design of biochar for specific applications.
