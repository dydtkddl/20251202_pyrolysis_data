2D CFD modeling for pyrolysis of a large biomass particle: Effect of L/D ratio, internal convection and shrinkage A transient 2D kinetic-heat transfer model for the pyrolysis of a large biomass particle, incorporating, primary and secondary reaction kinetics, internal convection and shrinkage in particles was developed and validated with experimental results. The RMS errors between the predicted and experimental temperature and residual mass fraction were estimated to be small - 0.020, 0.017, 0.011, 0.018 and 0.024, 0.022, 0.016, 0.025 at reactor temperatures of 573, 623, 673, 723 K, respectively. The pyrolysis behaviour was explained by the computed spatial distributions of velocity, pressure, temperature and residual mass fraction within the biomass particle. At a high L/D (∼5), two symmetric hot spots were formed near the two axial flat edges after 400 s, which formed a single dumbbell-shaped in the axial central core after 600 s and existed for a long time of 1500 s. It merged into a single spherical hot spot at the centre after a long reaction time. For a low L/D (∼1), however, an elliptical-shaped hot spot formed after 400 s changes to a spherical hot spot at the particle centre after 500 s. Uniformity in temperature inside the particle was attained much earlier at a smaller L/D ratio.
