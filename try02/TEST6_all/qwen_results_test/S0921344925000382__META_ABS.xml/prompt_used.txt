You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mild chemical recycling of waste wind turbine blade for direct reuse in production of thermoplastic composites with enhanced performance The increasing use of glass fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRP) in wind turbine (WT) blades poses significant recycling challenges. This study presents a mild chemical recycling method for WT GFRP waste, where the recyclates were repurposed to enhance the mechanical performance of thermoplastics. Specifically, WT GFRP waste was decomposed in aqueous solutions at temperatures ≤ 250 °C, achieving a degradation degree of up to 83.5%. The recycled GFRP (rGFRP), containing reclaimed glass fiber and decomposed matrix polymer, was directly compounded with commercial thermoplastics to produce fiber-reinforced composites. These rGFRP-reinforced thermoplastics exhibited superior mechanical properties, with tensile strength and modulus increasing from 40.4 MPa and 1.5 GPa for neat PA6 to 131.3 MPa and 15.5 GPa for composites containing 70 wt% rGFRP. This work offers a straightforward, environmentally friendly approach to recycling WT GFRP waste, providing a promising pathway for the high-value utilization of waste polymer composites.
