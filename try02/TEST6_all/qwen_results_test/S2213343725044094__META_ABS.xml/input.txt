Innovative photothermal membrane distillation: Mitigating temperature polarisation with rice husk biochar This study presents an innovative dual-layer hollow fibre (DLHF) polymeric membrane for photothermal membrane distillation (PMD), incorporating extracted carbon from rice husk char (RHC) as a sustainable photothermal additive to address two critical challenges in MD desalination: temperature polarisation (TP) and limited flux efficiency. The approach integrates optimisation of pyrolysis temperature, carbon extraction, and performance evaluation of the fabricated membranes. Results revealed that a high pyrolysis temperature (700°C) yielded RHC with enhanced physical properties for photothermal conversion and membrane integration, while a lower temperature (500°C) produced RHC with high carbon content and superior optical traits. RHC synthesised at 600°C provided the best balance of carbon content, particle structure, and light absorption, and was selected for carbon extraction. The extracted carbon (RHC 600-EC) exhibited notable improvements, including a 26.1 % reduction in particle size, a 66.3 % increase in Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, and a 94.4 % rise in total pore volume. It also demonstrated high carbon content (92.3 % by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, 81.1 % by carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur analysis) and excellent optical properties, with minimal reflectance (< 5 % in the ultraviolet and < 3 % in the visible-near infrared range). The photothermal membrane, fabricated with 5 wt% RHC 600-EC, achieved a 117 % rise in surface temperature and a solar-driven flux of 3.42 kg/m2·h under 0.5 kW/m2 irradiation, representing a 25-fold improvement over the pristine membrane. It further demonstrated a 39.3 % increase in energy efficiency, 59.4 % solar utilisation efficiency, and over 99.5 % salt rejection, highlighting its promising potential for efficient desalination.
