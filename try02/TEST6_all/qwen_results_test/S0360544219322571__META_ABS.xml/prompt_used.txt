You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of solid char produced from pyrolysis of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, high volatile coal and their blends In this study, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (Org-MSW) was blended with high-volatile coal (HVC) in proportions of 25/75%, 50/50%, 75/25% by weight. Pyrolysis of these mixtures was then investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a horizontal tube furnace under a nitrogen environment. The mass loss rate of samples, differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curves and kinetic analysis of the samples were compared for both blended and non-blended samples. Higher gas yields were seen with increasing pyrolysis temperature for both samples. In addition, the kinetic analysis indicated that the apparent activation energy values of org-MSW samples varied from 535 to 5284 kJ/kmol (over the temperature range of 100–887 °C), while the values for HVC were 247–962 kJ/kmol. The activation energy for HVC varied with temperature and the highest value of 2036 kJ/kmol was found in the temperature range of 336–490 °C. Comparable results were obtained between the TGA and fixed bed tests on the residual char fraction. The findings of this work will be very important in developing a co-firing technology for solid waste residuals and coal for energy production.
