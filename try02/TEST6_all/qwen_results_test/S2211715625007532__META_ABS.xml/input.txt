Performance optimization of CI engine using python with blends of waste oil biodiesel, plastic pyrolysis oil, and diesel This study explores the novel integration of ternary fuel blends comprising diesel, biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil, and pyrolysis oil obtained from waste plastics in a single-cylinder direct injection compression ignition (CI) engine. A major innovation lies in the simultaneous utilization of two waste-derived fuels—biodiesel and plastic pyrolysis oil—to create a sustainable, low-emission alternative to conventional diesel. Engine tests were conducted under varying injection pressures (170, 200, and 230 bar) and load conditions to evaluate brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and key emissions such as NOx, CO, UHC, and smoke opacity. The results indicate that blends such as P10B220D70 and P15B215D70 offer optimal engine performance and combustion stability at 230 bar injection pressure. Notably, a Python-based statistical correlation analysis was employed to determine the influence of input variables (fuel blend, injection pressure, and load) on engine performance and emissions, identifying injection pressure as the most significant factor. This integrated experimental and computational approach underscores the viability of ternary waste-fuel blends as a promising solution for cleaner and more efficient CI engine operation.
