You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance optimization of CI engine using python with blends of waste oil biodiesel, plastic pyrolysis oil, and diesel This study explores the novel integration of ternary fuel blends comprising diesel, biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil, and pyrolysis oil obtained from waste plastics in a single-cylinder direct injection compression ignition (CI) engine. A major innovation lies in the simultaneous utilization of two waste-derived fuels—biodiesel and plastic pyrolysis oil—to create a sustainable, low-emission alternative to conventional diesel. Engine tests were conducted under varying injection pressures (170, 200, and 230 bar) and load conditions to evaluate brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and key emissions such as NOx, CO, UHC, and smoke opacity. The results indicate that blends such as P10B220D70 and P15B215D70 offer optimal engine performance and combustion stability at 230 bar injection pressure. Notably, a Python-based statistical correlation analysis was employed to determine the influence of input variables (fuel blend, injection pressure, and load) on engine performance and emissions, identifying injection pressure as the most significant factor. This integrated experimental and computational approach underscores the viability of ternary waste-fuel blends as a promising solution for cleaner and more efficient CI engine operation.
