You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Release of phosphorus from thermal conversion of phosphorus-rich biomass chars – Evidence for carbothermic reduction of phosphates Biomass can be used to generate heat, power, or biofuels in thermal conversion processes such as combustion, gasification and pyrolysis. However, some types of biomass contain high levels of phosphorus, which can be released to the gas phase and cause operational or environmental problems. The mechanism(s) responsible for phosphorus release has not been convincingly established. Understanding the high-temperature phosphorus chemistry is also important in order to enable efficient recovery of phosphorus in residues from thermal conversion of biomass. In this work, the release of phosphorus from wheat bran char and sunflower seed char in different gas environments (100 % N2, 1–20 % O2, and 10 % CO2) and temperatures (900–1100 °C) was studied. The chars were converted in a horizontal tube reactor and characterized using ICP-OES, XRD, SEM-EDS, and 31P NMR. The release of ash-forming elements was determined using ICP-OES analysis of the char and sample residues, whereas the release of carbon was determined using CO and CO2 gas analysis. In both chars, phosphorus was present primarily together with potassium and magnesium, mainly as pyrophosphates in the wheat bran char, and largely as orthophosphates in the sunflower seed char. For wheat bran char, the release of phosphorus increased from 27 % at 900 °C to 71 % at 1100 °C in N2, whereas the release was at least 20 % lower in the oxidizing atmospheres (1–20 % O2, or 10 % CO2). The sunflower seed char reached a maximum release of 55 % at 1100 °C in N2. For wheat bran char, the molar ratio of released carbon/phosphorus was close to 2.5, which fits well with the theoretical value for carbothermic reduction of phosphates (P2O5(s, l) + 5C(s) → P2(g) + 5CO(g)). At 1100 °C, in N2, the release of phosphorus, potassium and sodium occurred mainly during the first 10 min. It was shown that KMgPO4, used as a model compound, could be reduced by carbon starting from 950 °C, but that some of the phosphorus remained in the condensed phase. The work provides a better understanding of phosphorus release and presents evidence showing that carbothermic reduction reactions can be an important phosphorus release mechanism for seed- and grain-based biomass char.
