You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unraveling combustion chemistry of tetramethoxysilane in flow reactor pyrolysis and laminar flame propagation Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS, Si(OCH3)4) is a widely used precursor in the vapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis (VAFS) of silica nanoparticles. This work reports the first attempt to investigate the flow reactor pyrolysis and laminar flame propagation of TMOS. Pyrolysis species were detected using gas chromatography (GC) at 1.09 atm and 930–1250 K, such as methane, methanol, ethylene, ethane and carbon monoxide, and their mole fraction profiles versus the heating temperature were also measured. The laminar flame propagation of TMOS/air mixtures was investigated in a constant-volume cylindrical combustion vessel at the initial pressure (Pu) of 1 atm, initial temperature (Tu) of 373 K and equivalence ratios from 0.7 to 1.4. TMOS has generally lower laminar burning velocities (LBVs) than many hydrocarbon fuels due to the high oxygen content and consequently low adiabatic flame temperature of TMOS. A kinetic model of TMOS combustion was developed and validated against both the new data in this work and the shock tube pyrolysis data in literature. Rate of production (ROP) analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to provide insight into the key pathways in TMOS decomposition. In the flow reactor pyrolysis, the methanol elimination reaction and the H-abstraction reactions dominate the decomposition of TMOS. Among the primary decomposition products, CH2OSi(OCH3)2 mainly isomerizes to CH3OSi(=O)OC2H5, while CH2OSi(OCH3)3 and OSi(OCH3)3 mainly decompose via β-Si-O scission reactions producing OSi(OCH3)3 and OSi(OCH3)2, respectively. The primary decomposition pathways of TMOS can all eventually lead to the formation of SiO2. In the laminar flame propagation, the modeling analyses indicate formaldehyde and methyl radical are abundantly produced, making many reactions involving the two intermediates influential on the laminar flame propagation of TMOS.
