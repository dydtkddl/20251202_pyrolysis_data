Zero-valent bimetallic catalyst/absorbent for simultaneous facilitation of MgSO3 oxidation and arsenic uptake Cobalt (Co)-based catalysts can efficiently reduce the heat waste from sulfate concentration by enhancing sulfite oxidation during wet flue gas desulfurization system. However, arsenic (As) can poison such catalysts and migrate into the sulfate by-products, resulting in severe secondary pollution. In this study, a zero-valent Co/iron (Fe)-based nanoparticle (NZV-Co2Fe1) was fabricated and applied as a bifunctional catalyst/adsorbent. The catalytic stability of the Co-based catalyst was enhanced by the introduction of Fe because the poisonous effect of As was substantially suppressed because of the high adsorption capacity of Fe for As. Compared with the noncatalytic benchmark, the presence of 0.5 g/L NZV-Co2Fe1 can increase the rate of MgSO3 oxidation by approximately 12-fold even at a high concentration of As (2.5 mg/L). The Langmuir model was fitted to the As adsorption isotherms, indicating that As uptake is a single-layer adsorption process. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model indicated that As was removed through chemisorption. The oxidation pathway of As(III) involves reactive radicals (mainly OH, SO4 − and SO5 − ) and ligand-to-metal charge transfer between SO3 2− and Co2+. The availability of MgSO3 improved the removal efficiency at high concentrations of As(III) (1 mg/L). These results indicate that using NZV-Co2Fe1 as a catalyst to purify the by-products of flue gas desulfurization can effectively prevent secondary pollution.
