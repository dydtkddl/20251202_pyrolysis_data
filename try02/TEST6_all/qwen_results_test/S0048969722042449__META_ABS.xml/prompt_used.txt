You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zero-valent bimetallic catalyst/absorbent for simultaneous facilitation of MgSO3 oxidation and arsenic uptake Cobalt (Co)-based catalysts can efficiently reduce the heat waste from sulfate concentration by enhancing sulfite oxidation during wet flue gas desulfurization system. However, arsenic (As) can poison such catalysts and migrate into the sulfate by-products, resulting in severe secondary pollution. In this study, a zero-valent Co/iron (Fe)-based nanoparticle (NZV-Co2Fe1) was fabricated and applied as a bifunctional catalyst/adsorbent. The catalytic stability of the Co-based catalyst was enhanced by the introduction of Fe because the poisonous effect of As was substantially suppressed because of the high adsorption capacity of Fe for As. Compared with the noncatalytic benchmark, the presence of 0.5 g/L NZV-Co2Fe1 can increase the rate of MgSO3 oxidation by approximately 12-fold even at a high concentration of As (2.5 mg/L). The Langmuir model was fitted to the As adsorption isotherms, indicating that As uptake is a single-layer adsorption process. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model indicated that As was removed through chemisorption. The oxidation pathway of As(III) involves reactive radicals (mainly OH, SO4 − and SO5 − ) and ligand-to-metal charge transfer between SO3 2− and Co2+. The availability of MgSO3 improved the removal efficiency at high concentrations of As(III) (1 mg/L). These results indicate that using NZV-Co2Fe1 as a catalyst to purify the by-products of flue gas desulfurization can effectively prevent secondary pollution.
