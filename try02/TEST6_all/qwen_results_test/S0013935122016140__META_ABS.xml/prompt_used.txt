You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multivariable modeling, optimization and experimental study of Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution using peanut shell biochar Peanut shell biomass was selected and utilized to produce biochar through pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere at 923 K. After studying various effects of experimental parameters and by statistical modeling and optimization by RSM using Box-Benken design, optimized conditions of pH 2.0 ± 0.1, temperature 303 K, and adsorbent dose used of 2.5 g L−1 were obtained giving almost 99.99% removal for Cr(VI) from the solution. FESEM, FTIR, XRD, XPS, EDX, elemental mapping, and pHzpc were used for the evaluation of the surface characteristics of peanut shell biochar (PSB). Studies revealed C–O, C–H, CO, and O–H functional groups’ presence with the help of FTIR, majorly in control of adsorption mechanism and the EDX confirmed the presence of Cr(VI) onto peanut shell biochar (PSB). Further adsorption mechanism for Cr(VI) adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order rate with adsorption capacity of 29.38 mg g−1 given by the Langmuir isotherm. The thermodynamic study confirmed the exothermic and spontaneous nature of the process for Cr(VI) adsorption onto PSB. The adsorption mechanism showed electrostatic attraction, reduction, and complexation mainly responsible for Cr(VI) adsorption by PSB. Thus, PSB effectively removes Cr(VI) is confirmed by the present study.
