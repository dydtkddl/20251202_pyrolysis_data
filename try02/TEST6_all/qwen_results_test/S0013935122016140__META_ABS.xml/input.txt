Multivariable modeling, optimization and experimental study of Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution using peanut shell biochar Peanut shell biomass was selected and utilized to produce biochar through pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere at 923 K. After studying various effects of experimental parameters and by statistical modeling and optimization by RSM using Box-Benken design, optimized conditions of pH 2.0 ± 0.1, temperature 303 K, and adsorbent dose used of 2.5 g L−1 were obtained giving almost 99.99% removal for Cr(VI) from the solution. FESEM, FTIR, XRD, XPS, EDX, elemental mapping, and pHzpc were used for the evaluation of the surface characteristics of peanut shell biochar (PSB). Studies revealed C–O, C–H, CO, and O–H functional groups’ presence with the help of FTIR, majorly in control of adsorption mechanism and the EDX confirmed the presence of Cr(VI) onto peanut shell biochar (PSB). Further adsorption mechanism for Cr(VI) adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order rate with adsorption capacity of 29.38 mg g−1 given by the Langmuir isotherm. The thermodynamic study confirmed the exothermic and spontaneous nature of the process for Cr(VI) adsorption onto PSB. The adsorption mechanism showed electrostatic attraction, reduction, and complexation mainly responsible for Cr(VI) adsorption by PSB. Thus, PSB effectively removes Cr(VI) is confirmed by the present study.
