You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of vegetable oils over NbOPO4 for SAF and green diesel production Drop-in biofuels for aviation have been pointed out as a sustainable alternative for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. These fuels are hydrocarbons and have a performance and composition similar to fossil fuels. Developing conversion routes for their production has stimulated different research projects and is considered one of the most challenging areas in biofuels research. In the present study, the liquid phase was analyzed and the biohydrocarbons were obtained from vegetable oils in the distillation range of gasoline, diesel, and aviation kerosene using NbOPO4 as a catalyst in the pyrolysis process. This catalyst was characterized by XRD and gas adsorption/desorption methods (BET, BJH, and TPD). The fatty materials' simultaneous deoxygenation, cracking, and partial isomerization reactions were performed at 350 °C under N2 atmosphere (10 bar), with up to 95% conversions. Considering the overlap of carbon chains in the fuel ranges, this study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain up to 21%, 83%, and 80% of biogasoline, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and green diesel, respectively. The products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The freezing temperatures of the products without any purification treatment and their mixtures with fossil kerosene were measured by DSC. The SAF obtained after the distillation step, presented a freezing point of − 47 °C, in agreement with the standard ASTM 7566. This innovative, sustainable, and low-cost process is promising for industrial use, mainly because hydrogen was not used, and reactions were performed in a one-pot procedure.
