You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of co-refining of fast pyrolysis oil from Salix via catalytic cracking and hydroprocessing Lignocellulosic biomass from energy crops, i.e., short rotation coppice willows such as Salix spp., can be used as feedstock for production of transportation biofuels. Biomass conversion via fast pyrolysis followed by co-refining with fossil oil in existing refinery infrastructure could enable a fast introduction of large-scale production of biofuels. In this study, Salix was first liquefied using ablative fast pyrolysis in a pilot scale unit. The resulting pyrolysis oil, rich in oxygenates, was thereafter co-refined in 20 wt% ratio with fossil feedstock using two separate technologies, a fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) laboratory unit and a continuous slurry hydroprocessing pilot plant. In the FCC route, the pyrolysis oil was cracked at 798 K using a commercial FCC catalyst at atmospheric pressure, while in the hydroprocessing route, the oil was processed at 693 K and a hydrogen pressure of 15 MPa in the presence of an unsupported molybdenum sulfide catalyst. Both routes resulted in significant deoxygenation (97 wt% versus 93 wt%). It is feasible to co-refine pyrolysis oil using both methods, the main difference being that the hydroprocessing results in a significantly higher biogenic carbon yield from the pyrolysis oil to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon products (92 wt%) but would in turn require input of H2. In the cracking route, besides the liquid product, a significant part of the biogenic carbon ends up as gas and as coke on the catalyst. The choice of route depends, among other factors, on the available amount of bio-oil and refining infrastructures.
