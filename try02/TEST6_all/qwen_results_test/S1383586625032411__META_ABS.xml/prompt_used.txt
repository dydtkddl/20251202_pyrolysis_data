You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of Fe-doped Perilla straw for value-added chemical production and functional biochar for Cr(VI) removal from water Cr(VI) contamination in water resources presents a critical environmental and public health challenge, demanding immediate and effective remediation strategies. Conventional Cr(VI) treatment technologies are often energy-intensive and may result in secondary pollution. This study explores a sustainable Cr(VI) remediation strategy using a zero-valent iron (Fe0)-biochar composite synthesized through FeCl3-assisted pyrolysis of Perilla straw, achieving dual environmental benefits: agricultural waste upcycling into value-added products and Cr(VI) remediation. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that FeCl3 pretreatment altered the thermal degradation pathway of (hemi)cellulose in Perilla straw, promoting the production of furfural-rich pyrogenic oil and enhanced H2 generation while suppressing CO formation. The evolved H2 facilitated the carbothermic reduction of Fe moieties in Perilla straw to Fe0. Batch experiments, column tests, and composite characterizations revealed that the integration of functional groups of biochar with Fe0 synergistically enhanced Cr(VI) removal by combining chemisorption via surface complexation, Fe0-mediated redox reduction, and insoluble Cr(III)-hydroxide formation. These findings highlight that the pyrolysis of FeCl3-treated Perilla straw enables cleaner production of H2 gas, industrial chemical resources, and effective materials for environmental remediation.
