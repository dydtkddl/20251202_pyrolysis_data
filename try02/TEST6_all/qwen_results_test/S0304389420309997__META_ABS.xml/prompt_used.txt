You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate plastic into N-doped microporous carbon for CO2 capture through a one-pot synthesis Valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into microporous carbon with N-doping treatment was successfully performed in a one-pot synthesis and the N-doped microporous carbon was used for CO2 capture, which can mitigate plastic pollution and climate change simultaneously. The PET-derived microporous carbon developed by KOH activation and urea treatment in a one-pot synthesis at 700 °C exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption uptake of 6.23 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 4.58 mmol g−1 at 25 °C (1 atm). The Langmuir and pseudo second-order models displayed well-fitting relationships with equilibrium and kinetic experimental data obtained in this study. The N-doped microporous carbon showed high CO2 selectivity over N2, implying that it is feasible for treating flue gases (10% CO2 and 90% N2) at 50 °C. In addition, the CO2 uptake was not only affected by micropores but also related with nitrogen and oxygen functional groups. Compared to the porous carbon prepared by two-pot synthesis where KOH activation and urea treatment were conducted separately, the porous carbon prepared by one-pot synthesis had higher oxygen contents and higher CO2 adsorption uptake. All of findings implied that the N-doped microporous carbon was successfully developed from waste PET plastic for capturing CO2 and can play a promising role in both sustainable waste management and environmental protection.
