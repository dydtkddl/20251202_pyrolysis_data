Surface engineering of continuous flow microreactors via ALD: Design strategies and applications The current work provides a comprehensive analysis regarding the design, fabrication and application of continuous flow microreactors using atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD from microreactor perspective has not been discussed widely and the present study focuses on the essence of this technique in the development of catalytic surfaces for photocatalytic and thermocatalytic processes. This work also offers insights by exploring the intersection of thin film and microfluidic devices especially for catalytic and lab-on-chip applications leading to automation in analytical chemistry and point-of-care diagnostics. A concise set of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) case studies illustrates how coupled flow, mass-transfer and surface-reaction modelling guides reactor-shape optimisation and kinetic scaling. Collectively, these advances translate into lower reagent consumption, tighter residence-time control and higher space-time yields than are achievable in batch reactors, offering clear pathways toward industrial adoption. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges most notably, reactor parallelisation, precursor circularity and in-situ process metrology and chart research directions for scaling ALD-microreactor technology to large-volume manufacturing in energy conversion and environmental monitoring.
