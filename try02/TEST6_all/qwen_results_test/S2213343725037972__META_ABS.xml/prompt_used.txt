You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface engineering of continuous flow microreactors via ALD: Design strategies and applications The current work provides a comprehensive analysis regarding the design, fabrication and application of continuous flow microreactors using atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD from microreactor perspective has not been discussed widely and the present study focuses on the essence of this technique in the development of catalytic surfaces for photocatalytic and thermocatalytic processes. This work also offers insights by exploring the intersection of thin film and microfluidic devices especially for catalytic and lab-on-chip applications leading to automation in analytical chemistry and point-of-care diagnostics. A concise set of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) case studies illustrates how coupled flow, mass-transfer and surface-reaction modelling guides reactor-shape optimisation and kinetic scaling. Collectively, these advances translate into lower reagent consumption, tighter residence-time control and higher space-time yields than are achievable in batch reactors, offering clear pathways toward industrial adoption. Finally, we outline the remaining challenges most notably, reactor parallelisation, precursor circularity and in-situ process metrology and chart research directions for scaling ALD-microreactor technology to large-volume manufacturing in energy conversion and environmental monitoring.
