You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous production of high-valued carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: The role of cellulose impurity Upcycling waste plastics into valuable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen via catalytic pyrolysis is a sustainable strategy to mitigate white pollution. However, real-world plastics are complex and generally contain organic impurities, such as cellulose, which have a non-negligible impact on the catalytic pyrolysis process and product distribution. In this study, cellulose was chosen as a model compound to distinguish the effects of oxygen-containing components on the CNTs and hydrogen production during the catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene. Different amounts of cellulose were mixed with polypropylene to regulate the O/C mass ratio of the feedstock, and the relationship between the O/C mass ratio and the yield of products has been built quantificationally. The results revealed that the relative content of CNTs increased to over 95%, and the stability and purity of carbon deposition increased accordingly when the O/C mass ratio is 0.05. This could be ascribed to the etching effects caused by small amounts of H2O and CO2 on amorphous carbon. However, further increasing the amount of cellulose caused the deactivation of the Fe-Ni catalyst. This not only decreased the carbon yield but had an adverse impact on its morphology and graphitization, leading to the increase of amorphous carbon. This study can provide fundamental guidance for the efficient utilization of waste plastics that take advantage of organic impurities in waste plastic to promote the formation of high-purity CNTs.
