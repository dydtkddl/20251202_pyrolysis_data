Increasing pyrolysis oil yields and decreasing energy consumption via thermal oxo-degradation of polyolefins Commercialization of pyrolysis of plastics in an inert atmosphere is challenging due to large thermal requirements. This study employs thermal oxo-degradation and demonstrates how oxygen supplied at modest equivalence ratios can both accelerate depolymerization and provide the enthalpy for pyrolysis without dramatically impacting desired product yields. The enthalpies for pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) are measured to be 2,300 ± 90 J g−-1 and 2,800 ± 60 J g−1, respectively. Using air as an oxygen source in a fluidized bed reactor, HDPE and PP are rapidly deconstructed while using up to 84% less energy through the energy released by partial oxidation. Characterization of the thermal oxo-degradation product oil shows comparable composition to conventional pyrolysis oil. Thermal oxo-degradation proves to be a promising technology for upcycling of plastics by improving thermal depolymerization of waste plastics and reducing energy requirements while maintaining desirable yields.
