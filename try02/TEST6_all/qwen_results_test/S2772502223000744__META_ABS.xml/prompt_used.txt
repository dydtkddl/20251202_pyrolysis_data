You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted drying of Ocimum sanctum leaves: Analysis of moisture content, drying kinetic model, and techno-economics This study aims to evaluate the drying kinetics of basil leaves using microwave-assisted drying (MAD) to determine moisture content, moisture ratio, drying rate, and economic analysis at various microwave power levels (136, 264, 440, and 616 W). This study discusses the economic analysis between microwave versus oven drying and this study has not been discussed in other studies. The leaves of basil are: 2.83 ± 0.1831 × 1.42 ± 0.1398 cm (small leaves); 4.08 ± 0.1619 × 1.83 ± 0.1059 cm (medium leaves); 6.16 ± 0.1713 × 2.70 ± 0.2357 cm (large leaves). They evaluated each condition using five thin layer models: Henderson and Pabis, Midilli et al., Hii et al., Verma et al., and Diffusion Approximation. Coefficient of correlation (R2), Chi-square (X2), Sum of Square Error (SSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Square Error (MSE) were used as the statistical parameters to determine the best drying kinetics model. The results show that the Hii et al. model is the most appropriate. An economic study was conducted between the selected microwave-assisted drying kinetics model and the optimum oven drying conditions from previous research results. Using 17 microwaves resulted in a Rate of Investment (ROI) of 46.9188%, Break Even Point (BEP) of 37.1189%, and interest rate (i) of 0.0094%. While using the 17 ovens resulted in an ROI calculation of 30.5957%, BEP of 43.6197%, and interest rate (i) of 0.0465%. Thus the microwave-assisted drying is more optimum than the oven drying. This research is expected to be useful for industry or further research in food science and the food industry.
