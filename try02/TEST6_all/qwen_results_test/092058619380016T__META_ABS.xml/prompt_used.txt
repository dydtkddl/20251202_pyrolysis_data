You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface and catalytic properties of Vanadia-Titania and Tungsta-Titania systems in the Selective Catalytic Reduction of nitrogen oxides The chemistry of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx with ammonia over V2O5-TiO2 and WO3-TiO2 catalysts has been investigated by Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Temperature Programmed Desorption, Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction and catalytic activity measurements. Protonated and molecularly coordinated ammonia species, associated with Brönsted and Lewis acid sites respectively and with different thermal stability, are observed upon NH3 adsorption. WO3-TiO2 show stronger Lewis and Brönsted acid sites than V2O5-TiO2. Upon heating in NO atmosphere, a reaction between adsorbed ammonia and gas-phase or weakly adsorbed NO is monitored by FT-IR and TPSR measurements. The results indicate that V2O5-TiO2 is significantly more active than WO3-TiO2, due to its superior redox properties. Monomeric vanadyls and meta-vanadate polymers are proposed as the active sites in the SCR reaction, the former sites showing lower reactivity. Oxygen is involved in the reaction and plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity of the catalysts.
