You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical characterization of the organic matter in forest soils by Curie point pyrolysis-GC/MS and pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry The chemical composition of three different forest humus layers (mull, moder, mor) was studied by flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (Py-GC/EIMS) and by temperature-programmed, direct pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) in order to evaluate the relevance of individual humus constituents for geoecological and geochemical processes. Pyrolysis products with a molecular weight up to 430 Dalton that derive from carbohydrates, intact and degraded lignins, proteins, lipids, polyphenols, and aliphatic polymers were identified by accurate mass measurements in the FI mode and by GC/EIMS. However, the pyrolysis products that caused the main differences between the Py-FI mass spectra of the three humus types in the mass range above m/z 300 were not recorded by Py-GC/EIMS. Their assignments are based on in-source pyrolysis and high resolution FIMS. They derive mainly from biphenyl-, diarylpropane-, phenylcoumaran-, and resinol-type subunits from lignin, and phytosterols and their dehydration products. Furthermore, free and bound lipids such as homologous series of n-fatty acids (C22-C32), alkyl monoesters (C40-C52), and aromatic esters (C27-C34) are found.
