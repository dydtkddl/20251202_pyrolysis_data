Experimental investigation on high-temperature co-gasiﬁcation and melting behavior of petrochemical sludge and bituminous coal in CO2 atmosphere High-temperature co-gasification of petrochemical sludge (PS) and bituminous coal (BC) can melt heavy metals and fly ash in hazardous waste, decompose dioxins, and generate syngas, which can achieve clean disposal and high value resource utilization of wastes. In this investigation, the high-temperature co-gasification and ash melting experiments of PS mixed with BC were carried out in a high-temperature tube furnace under CO2 atmosphere. The effects of gasification temperature and blending ratios (PS:BC) on co-gasification characteristics and ash melting behavior were investigated. The synergistic effect of co-gasification of PS-BC was examined. The results show that the yield of syngas (CO + H2) was proportional to the temperature and the proportion of BC. As the temperature increased from 1100 °C to 1400 °C, the yield of syngas increased from 1.42 m3/kg to 1.54 m3/kg. At 1300 °C, as the blending ratio of PS:BC shifted from 1:0 to 0:1, the yield of syngas increased significantly from 0.49 m3/kg to 1.88 m3/kg. The most significant synergistic effect of PS-BC co-gasification was the enhanced CO yield. At a blending ratio of 1:1, the synergistic coefficient of CO yield reached a maximum of 1.31. As for the residues, with the increase of temperature and the proportion of BC, the ash melting got promoted. The leaching toxicity of heavy metals in the residues can meet the release standard (GB5805.3–2007), being safe for disposal.
