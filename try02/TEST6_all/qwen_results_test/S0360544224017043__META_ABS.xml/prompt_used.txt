You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation on high-temperature co-gasiﬁcation and melting behavior of petrochemical sludge and bituminous coal in CO2 atmosphere High-temperature co-gasification of petrochemical sludge (PS) and bituminous coal (BC) can melt heavy metals and fly ash in hazardous waste, decompose dioxins, and generate syngas, which can achieve clean disposal and high value resource utilization of wastes. In this investigation, the high-temperature co-gasification and ash melting experiments of PS mixed with BC were carried out in a high-temperature tube furnace under CO2 atmosphere. The effects of gasification temperature and blending ratios (PS:BC) on co-gasification characteristics and ash melting behavior were investigated. The synergistic effect of co-gasification of PS-BC was examined. The results show that the yield of syngas (CO + H2) was proportional to the temperature and the proportion of BC. As the temperature increased from 1100 °C to 1400 °C, the yield of syngas increased from 1.42 m3/kg to 1.54 m3/kg. At 1300 °C, as the blending ratio of PS:BC shifted from 1:0 to 0:1, the yield of syngas increased significantly from 0.49 m3/kg to 1.88 m3/kg. The most significant synergistic effect of PS-BC co-gasification was the enhanced CO yield. At a blending ratio of 1:1, the synergistic coefficient of CO yield reached a maximum of 1.31. As for the residues, with the increase of temperature and the proportion of BC, the ash melting got promoted. The leaching toxicity of heavy metals in the residues can meet the release standard (GB5805.3–2007), being safe for disposal.
