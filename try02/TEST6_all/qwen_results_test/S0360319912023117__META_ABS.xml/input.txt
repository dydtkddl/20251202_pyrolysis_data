Progress of international hydrogen production network for the thermochemical Cu–Cl cycle This paper presents recent advances by an international team which is developing the thermochemical copper–chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycle for hydrogen production. Development of the Cu–Cl cycle has been pursued by several countries within the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) for hydrogen production with the next generation of nuclear reactors. Due to its lower temperature requirements in comparison with other thermochemical cycles, the Cu–Cl cycle is particularly well matched with Canada's Generation IV reactor, SCWR (Super-Critical Water Reactor), as well as other heat sources such as solar energy or industrial waste heat. In this paper, recent developments of the Cu–Cl cycle are presented, specifically involving unit operation experiments, corrosion resistant materials and system integration.
