Current status and potential strategies for crack-free tungsten by laser powder bed fusion: A review Tungsten (W) has wide application in many high-end fields, however, post-processing and forming of complex parts are difficult for traditional manufacturing due to its inherent properties. Therefore attention has been paid to laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of W. But there are micro cracking and pores in as-built parts, which decrease density, quality and limit their wide application. The current status of LPBF of W is reviewed with emphasis on the overall influence factors of powder property and process parameters (laser parameters, forming parameters and other parameters) on their density/quality at first, then formation mechanism of defects, numerical simulation, complex parts and their application are followed. Next, traditional methods to reduce defects by alloying and composites are summarized. The reason for cracking in LPBF of W is mainly due to solid-state cracking and hot cracking as well. For the indelible micro cracking in as-built parts, potential strategies of structure design, composition optimization, hybrid additive manufacturing methods, grain boundary engineering, defect engineering, metastability engineering and post treatment are put forward.
