You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimal Co-pyrolysis of municipal sewage sludge and microalgae Chlorella Vulgaris: Products characterization, synergistic effects, mechanism, and reaction pathways Co-pyrolysis of municipal sewage sludge (MSS) and microalgae Chlorella Vulgaris (MCV) was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate the effect of feedstocks interaction on pyrolysis products and synergistic effects. Based on previous authors' research, the optimum values of reaction parameters were T = 520 °C, mixing ratio (MCV/MSS) = 0.82, and an inert gas flow rate of 0.55 L/min. For the investigation of synergetic effects at optimum point, theoretical values anticipated from each characteristic were computed as an arithmetic sum of the single pyrolysis values obtained. For the first time, by using GC analysis, changes in gas components (H2, CO, CO2, CH4) at different temperatures (220–520 °C) and reaction times (0–30 min) have been investigated. Referring to GC-MS results the percentages of oxygen-containing species, alkanes, alkenes, aliphatic, aromatic, and total hydrocarbons were changed from the theoretical value of (41.719%), (6.004%), (11.215%), (17.219%), (4.317%), and (21.536%) to experimental value (39.292%), (3.693%), (12.103%), (15.796%), (0%), and (15.796%) respectively. Fatty acids and N&O-containing compounds (amides) were increased from (12.297%) to (26.009%) and (6.989%) to (16.217%), respectively. Co-pyrolysis bio-oil was rich in fatty acids and amides compounds. So, co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and Chlorella Vulgaris provides a new orientation for high value-added utilization of biomass. It was observed that the nitrogen and oxygen content of biochar was reduced (0.29% and 1.01% respectively) compared to the theoretical condition. In the end, a comprehensive mechanism, synergistic, and reaction pathways of co-pyrolysis of MCV and MSS were presented.
