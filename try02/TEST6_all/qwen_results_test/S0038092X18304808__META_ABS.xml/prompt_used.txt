You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of solar thermal energy storage in beds of particles: Packed and fluidized beds This review summarizes different solar thermal energy storage techniques from a particle technology perspective, including sensible, latent and thermochemical techniques for low- and high-temperature applications that use particles as the storage medium in the thermal energy storage system. The focus is on applications, experimental results, modeling and future trends. This review describes two different particle technologies used to store thermal energy: packed and fluidized beds. The advantages and disadvantages of both technologies are reviewed throughout different studies found in the literature for various thermal energy storage systems. Packed beds have the main advantage of thermal stratification, which increases the efficiency of solar collectors in low-temperature sensible energy storage systems and augments the exergy content in the bed. Moreover, they have been proven to be suitable as dual-media thermocline storage systems for CSP plants. In contrast, the high mixing rates of fluidized beds makes them suitable for the rapid distribution of concentrated solar energy in particle receiver CSP systems. In addition, their high heat and mass transfer rates, compared with those of packed beds, make them the preferred particle technology for thermochemical energy storage applications. This review also notes that it is important to find new materials with an appropriate size and density that can be properly used in a fluidized bed. Additionally, more specific research efforts are necessary to improve the understanding of the behavior of these materials during the fluidization process and over a high number of charging/discharging cycles.
