You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced catalytic performance of nitrogen-doped carbon supported FeOx-based catalyst derived from electrospun nanofiber crosslinked N, Fe-containing MOFs for efficient hydrogenation of nitroarenes Rational design and development of stable nitrogen-doped carbon supported non-noble metal based nanocatalysts with unique natures of active species and support for highly chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes to arylamines remains a grand challenge. Here, firstly, an N, Fe-containing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been designed and synthesized. Furthermore, an efficient N-doped carbon fiber supported FeOx-based nanocatalyst (FeOx@CN-hpes) was prepared via pyrolysis of MOF@polymer composite towards electrospun nanofiber crosslinked N, Fe-containing MOFs. Remarkably, the developed FeOx@CN-hpes enables the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline with unprecedented performance (215.8 h−1) compared to those of FeOx@CN-hp (176.2 h−1) and FeOx@CN-pes (45.2 h−1) catalysts prepared by conventional approaches. The comparative characterizations have revealed that the high dispersion of FeOx species, enhanced basicity, and more structural defects and Fe-Nx species towards FeOx@CN-hpes are responsible for the high performance. Moreover, the effect of the pyrolysis temperature towards FeOx@CN-hpes on the performance of hydrogenation reaction was also systematically investigated. The results indicated that the FeOx@CN-hpes-400 catalyst prepared at 400 °C was identified as the best hydrogenation catalyst. More importantly, the FeOx@CN-hpes-400 catalyst exhibited excellent activity and exclusive selectivity for the hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes to corresponding arylamines, as well as successive recyclability without any loss in both activity and selectivity. Therefore, this work provides a feasible strategy for the synthesis of other heterogeneous MOFs-based derived catalysts with superior catalytic performance for diverse industrial processes.
