You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High value olefins from polypropylene by in situ catalytic pyrolysis The development of low-cost, renewable catalysts for catalyzing the pyrolysis of waste plastics to enable selective upgrading and recycling remains a major challenge. This study reports a novel biochar-loaded calcium-based catalyst that demonstrates excellent olefin selectivity and catalytic efficiency in situ pyrolysis of polypropylene, outperforming traditional catalysts in catalytic performance. The reaction was performed using an in-house developed carbon-based calcium catalyst, which was characterized and examined using a variety of analytical test methods. The effects of catalyst calcium metal loading, feedstock/catalyst ratio and reaction temperature on pyrolysis oil yield and olefin content were investigated. The results showed that olefins and cycloalkanes were the main components of pyrolysis oil in the catalytic pyrolysis experiments, with carbon number distribution between C13 and C25. Under optimal conditions (480 °C, 25 % Ca loading, feedstock/catalyst ratio of 1:0.2), a maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 93.75 % (0.91 g/gpp) was achieved, with an olefin content of 58.87 % (0.55 g/gpp). The high dispersion of Ca2+ species on the porous biochar support was found to synergistically promote C–C bond cleavage while suppressing coke formation via pore confinement and radical stabilization mechanisms. This work offers a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high-quality oils from plastic waste.
