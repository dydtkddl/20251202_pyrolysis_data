You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterizing ecosystem-driven chemical composition differences in natural and drained Finnish bogs using pyrolysis-GC/MS Aerobic decomposition increases in drained peatlands; releasing stored organic matter (OM) and shifting greenhouse gas fluxes from sink to source. This study explored how drainage influenced peat OM chemical composition by investigating paired sites from a Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic Finnish bog undergoing contrasting hydrological management (natural and drained). Peat OM was investigated in replicate cores using analytical pyrolysis, compared with observed vegetation, elemental analysis (O:C, N:C), stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N), and fraction radiocarbon. Principal component analysis of quantified pyrolysis products separated four primary components: vascular plants vs Sphagnum, aerobic degradation of fresh plant biomass, anaerobic processes in water-saturated depths, and pine vs Eriophorum. The largest influence of drainage on peat chemistry was via aerobic decomposition (decreased abundance of Sphagnum phenols and simple polysaccharides; accumulation of macromolecular polysaccharides) ( p < 0.05, 0–2 cm). Drainage-induced shifts in vegetation (from Sphagnum to Pinus sylvestris ( p < 0.01, 0–2 cm) were reflected by increased abundance in lignin, N-compounds, and lipids, and decreased abundance in phenols and polysaccharides. Anaerobic processes also differentiated the natural and drained sites and primarily affected polysaccharides ( p < 0.05, 0–2, 8–10 cm). Vegetation shifts and aerobic decomposition similarly affected many of the same compounds upon drainage– demonstrating the simultaneous influence of different processes on the same OM. Pre-drainage inter-core variation illustrated the importance of replicate cores in disentangling anthropogenic changes from natural biodiversity. These findings suggest that even short-term and moderate alterations in peatland hydrology strongly influence the chemical composition of peat OM, and that its chemistry serves as an effective indicator to assess decomposition status.
