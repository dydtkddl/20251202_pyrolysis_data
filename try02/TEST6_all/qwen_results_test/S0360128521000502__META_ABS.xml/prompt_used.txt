You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modelling and optimisation of biomass injection in ironmaking blast furnaces Biomass is a renewable and potentially carbon-neutral energy source and can be a promising alternative to fossil fuels in the ironmaking industry. Pulverised biomass injection (PBI) is the most promising technology to use biomass-based materials in ironmaking blast furnaces (BFs). This paper reviews key aspects of recent research relating to biomass combustion in the raceway region: experimental studies, numerical studies, and the application of the research findings to optimise BF practice. In the experimental part, the pretreatment of raw biomass to produce pyrolysed biochar products for improving applicability in BFs is reviewed. The properties of raw biomass and biochar are compared with the main requirements for injection into BFs, and the process tests that have been employed at lab- and pilot-scales are reviewed. In the modelling part, a comprehensive overview of mathematical modelling of biomass combustion in BFs is presented, ranging from turbulent flow to heat transfer and mass transfer, as well as key reaction models for simulating the lower part of the BF. With respect to the application of the research, in-furnace phenomena understanding, operation optimisation, and facility design are reviewed, including the co-firing of biomass and coal. In addition, heat and mass balance modelling has been used to demonstrate the operating window of feasible operations using PBI. Life cycle assessment has been reviewed to demonstrate PBI's environmental credentials. Based on the aspects reviewed, conclusions have been drawn on the strengths, limitations, and outlook of PBI studies. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the combustion of biomass in BFs and should prove useful for process understanding, design and optimisation towards green ironmaking technology.
