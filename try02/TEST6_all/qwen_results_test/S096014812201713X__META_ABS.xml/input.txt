Coarse-grained CFD-DEM simulation of coal and biomass co-gasification process in a fluidized bed reactor: Effects of particle size distribution and operating pressure The co-gasification of coal and biomass through fluidized bed gasifier is a promising technology for the improvement of the utilization efficiency of fossil fuels and the development of renewable energy. In this work, a coarse-grained computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) simulation is performed to investigate the co-gasification process in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier. The effects of particle size distribution and operating pressure on the hydrodynamics, heat transfer, and co-gasification performance are analyzed. The results show that the increase of sand particle size distribution (PSD) width slightly affects the particle concentration distribution, particle residence time distribution, and co-gasification performance. The heat transfer rate of convection is an order of magnitude higher than those of conduction and radiation. At higher PSD width, the formation of the vertical solid temperature gradient at the bed bottom is attributed to the deteriorated solid mixing. As the operating pressure increases, the bed temperature decreases apparently. In addition, the variation of the convective heat transfer rate dominates the heat transfer efficiency as the operating pressure changes. The application of elevated operating pressure benefits to the thermal-chemical conversion of blend fuel since the char conversion reaction is accelerated.
