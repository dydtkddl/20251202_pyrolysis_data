Structured carbon for electromagnetic shielding and microwave absorption from carbonization of waste Polymer: A review The substantial volume of polymer waste generated globally predominantly consists of synthetic polymers and biopolymers. Recycling and reusing these waste polymers not only promote energy conservation and emission reduction but also represent a meaningful approach to managing polymer waste. Carbonization emerges as an effective technological pathway for transforming waste polymer precursors into valuable carbon materials. This process not only mitigates environmental impact but also sparks innovative resource utilization ideas, including the development of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and microwave absorption (MA) materials. Given that carbon constitutes the primary component of most polymers, waste polymers serve as viable carbon sources for producing value-added carbon products through carbonization. Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in converting plastics or cellulose into carbon, particularly in nanostructured and graphite carbon materials. This review concentrates on the fundamental types and essential technical methods for carbonizing waste polymers. It subsequently explores the potential applications of these carbon materials in electromagnetic shielding and microwave absorption. Finally, the article delves into the challenges associated with the carbonization process of waste polymers and proposes some solutions and prospects, aiming to offer valuable references for research on waste polymer recycling and structural carbon preparation.
