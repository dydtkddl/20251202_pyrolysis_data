You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structured carbon for electromagnetic shielding and microwave absorption from carbonization of waste Polymer: A review The substantial volume of polymer waste generated globally predominantly consists of synthetic polymers and biopolymers. Recycling and reusing these waste polymers not only promote energy conservation and emission reduction but also represent a meaningful approach to managing polymer waste. Carbonization emerges as an effective technological pathway for transforming waste polymer precursors into valuable carbon materials. This process not only mitigates environmental impact but also sparks innovative resource utilization ideas, including the development of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and microwave absorption (MA) materials. Given that carbon constitutes the primary component of most polymers, waste polymers serve as viable carbon sources for producing value-added carbon products through carbonization. Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in converting plastics or cellulose into carbon, particularly in nanostructured and graphite carbon materials. This review concentrates on the fundamental types and essential technical methods for carbonizing waste polymers. It subsequently explores the potential applications of these carbon materials in electromagnetic shielding and microwave absorption. Finally, the article delves into the challenges associated with the carbonization process of waste polymers and proposes some solutions and prospects, aiming to offer valuable references for research on waste polymer recycling and structural carbon preparation.
