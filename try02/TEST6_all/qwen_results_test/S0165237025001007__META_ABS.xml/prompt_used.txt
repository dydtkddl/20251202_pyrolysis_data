You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of PC/ABS-blends by pyrolysis Not all plastics can be recycled mechanically. Polycarbonate (PC) combined with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is one such material used in applications like electronic casings and automotive components. Since mechanical recycling of PC/ABS results in thermal degradation and the loss of required properties, alternative methods are sought. Pyrolysis, the thermal decomposition without oxygen, preferentially cleaves certain bonds, yielding valuable monomers. This study investigates the pyrolysis of non-flame-retarded and flame-retarded PC/ABS blends at laboratory and pilot plant scales. Analyses utilized thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR). The blends exhibited two decomposition stages influenced by flame retardants. The IR spectra provided insights into the structural properties of volatile compounds. CO2 yield ranged from 6 % to 8 %, with the flame-retarded blend showing 0.5–1 % higher yields. Subsequently, we conducted experiments in a fixed-bed reactor, varying the pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and blend composition. Masses of gaseous, liquid, and solid products were measured, with a liquid yield optimum at 480–500∘C. All product fractions were analyzed. Liquid products contained valuable compounds like phenol, styrene, and bisphenol-A, analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC×GC-MS). For the non-flame-retardant blend, bisphenol-A was the main product (25–30 %), while phenol dominated (10–15 %) in the flame-retardant blend.
