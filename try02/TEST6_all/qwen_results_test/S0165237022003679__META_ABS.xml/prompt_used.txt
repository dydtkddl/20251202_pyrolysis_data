You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons from fast pyrolysis of waste medical mask catalyzed by modified HZSM-5 The safe and efficient utilization of waste medical masks has attracted worldwide attention. Fast pyrolysis with the catalysis of zeolites can provide a promising route for the production of value-added aromatic hydrocarbons from waste medical masks. Herein, HZSM-5 was employed and modified by metal loading (Ga, Mo) and alkali treatment for the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of mask filters. The non-catalytic pyrolysis of mask filters only led to a low yield of aromatics. When HZSM-5 catalysts were employed, the liquid long-chain olefins, cycloalkanes, and alcohols, as well as gaseous light hydrocarbons were mainly converted into aromatics. According to the micro-scale pyrolysis experiments, the alkali treatment as well as Ga and Mo loading further promoted the generation of aromatics, with aromatic yields of 52.8 wt%, 54.1 wt%, and 46.3 wt%, respectively. For alkali treatment, the NaOH concentration of 0.3 mol/L was most effective for aromatic production, due to the moderate change in the pore size. For metal loading, Ga loading had better performance than Mo loading because the former resulted in a higher specific surface area while the two modified catalysts possessed similar acid activity. When the two modification methods were combined, the yields of aromatics increased to 56.7 wt% and 60.3 wt% under the catalysis of Mo/Na-HZSM-5 and Ga/Na-HZSM-5. Based on the lab-scale experiments, the aromatic yield could reach 63.0 wt% with the catalysis of Ga/Na-HZSM-5, accompanied by a high selectivity of 87.6% for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). In summary, both MAHs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were promoted with these catalyst modification methods by expanding the mesopore size and adjusting acid site distribution, with greater promotion on the formation of MAHs.
