Manufacturing of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics and its recovery of carbon fiber: A review Polymer matrix composites are excellent materials for a variety of industrial applications. They have superior mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, making them preferable to traditional materials such as metal. To make polymer matrix composite materials, thermosetting, elastomers and thermoplastic polymers are mainly the three types of polymers that can be utilized as matrices. In comparison to thermosetting and elastomers polymers, carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP), is the subject of this research, are gaining popularity in many industrial sectors due to its recyclability, simplicity of processing, good characteristics, flexibility, and less production time. This review covers conventional and state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques of CFRTP. Moreover, the potential and existing of CFRTP's application as well as the techniques of carbon fiber recovery and recycling methods of such materials were also examined. Overall, this study considers the research and development on manufacturing CFRTP and recycling techniques of polymer composites to recover carbon fiber materials.
