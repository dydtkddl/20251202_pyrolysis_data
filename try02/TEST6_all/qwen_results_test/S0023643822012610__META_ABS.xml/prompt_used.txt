You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Product development and X-Ray microtomography of a traditional white pan bread from plasma functionalized flour Cold plasma (CP) technology has emerged as a novel non-thermal technology with the potential to improve food quality or impart functionality to ingredients. Our previous studies on wheat flour demonstrated how the structure and functionality of wheat flour might be modified using CP to provide an alternative to chemical additives (Chaple et al., 2020). However, understanding of the further effects of plasma functionalized ingredients in existing or new product formulation is limited. This study investigated the effects of CP treatment of wheat flour on traditional white pan bread development. The bread was formulated using plasma functionalized flour (PFF), and critical product characteristic responses were analyzed. Plasma treatment of flour positively affected the bread's expansion ratio, crust color, and water activity. Farinograph analysis suggests improvement in water absorption capacity, dough development time, and dough stability. X-Ray Microtomography (XRMT) analysis was conducted to understand how plasma functionalising the flour impacted the microstructure of bread. The 3D scans suggested no macro-change in the bread matrix compared to control; however, the porosity decreased in line with the increasing plasma treatment duration of the flour. The texture profile analysis showed an improvement in the gluten network developed in the dough developed from PFF. Sensory analysis results showed overall acceptance for bread formulated with PFF compared with a commercial sample. Overall, CP treatment of the flour improved the functionality in relation to dough and bread preparation and can thus provide an alternative to chemical additives in bread making. The CP processes may be modulated to deliver tailored effects for bread product development.
