You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in functionalizing ZIFs and their derived carbon materials towards electrocatalytic water splitting Hydrogen energy, as a promising alternative to accomplish the energy conversion and storage, has inspired tremendous research interests in the past decades. Particularly, the green hydrogen production by electrocatalytic water splitting (EWS) is crucial for the advance of renewable and clean energy resources. However, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are prime roadblocks for the commercial application. The exploration of efficient, durable and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER is pivotal for the scalable production of green hydrogen through EWS. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), consisted of metal cations and organic ligands, are emerging as prominent precursors for the exploration of bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting owing to their unique characteristics, such as 3D porous networks, large specific surface area, tunable composition, variable architecture, as well as high chemical and thermal stability. By pyrolysis of ZIFs, the resultant carbon materials have nearly inherited the merits of ZIFs and are also famous for various actives species, i.e., self-doped nitrogen, metal-nitrogen, and metal nanoparticles/alloy/metal oxides, etc., which are beneficial to the electrocatalytic performance. In this review, we survey the recent progress in developing of efficient OER and HER bifunctional electrocatalysts for EWS, highlighting different modification strategies for the preparation of ZIFs-derived multi-doped porous carbon materials. First, the general descriptions of EWS and ZIFs materials are introduced. Subsequently, the pristine ZIFs derived carbon materials and their catalytic performance are presented. Afterwards, the pre-modification, in-situ modification and the post-modification of ZIFs and the resulting carbon materials are detailed in Section 3, 4 and 5, including the synthetic methods, electrocatalytic performance, the correlations of composition-structure-performance. Finally, we summarize the corresponding challenges and future perspectives in this rapidly growing field.
