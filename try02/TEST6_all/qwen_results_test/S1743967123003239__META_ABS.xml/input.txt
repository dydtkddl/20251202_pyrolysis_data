Co-Pyrolysis of walnut shell and waste tire with a focus on bio-oil yield quantity and quality In this study, a series of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis experiments on waste tires and walnut shells were conducted under ideal conditions of 500 °C, 10 °C/min heating rate, and 60 min of retention time. Mixture samples with WS/WT: 3/1, 2/2, and 1/3 additive ratios were utilized in co-pyrolysis experiments. The results of the experiments showed that the WS/WT: 3/1 additive ratio samples were necessary to achieve the positive synergistic effect. A 52.57 ± 0.28 % efficient liquid product by mass was produced under these conditions on a dry, ashless basis, which has a significant production potential for the production of high pyrolytic oil. The co-pyrolytic organic phase of the fuel contains around 40 % light naphtha, 10 % heavy naphtha, and 30 % medium distillate by volume, according to atmospheric distillation experiments. Furthermore, it has been discovered that this product can be utilized as a gasoline or gasoline additive due to its IBP-72 °C boiling point range, 20 % distillate percentage, and immediate or inexpensive improvement. When these observations are taken into consideration, it is clear that the co-pyrolytic liquid can be utilized as a raw material input in the production of various of commercial liquid fuels as well as a variety of chemicals with high added value.
