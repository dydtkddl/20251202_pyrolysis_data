You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-Pyrolysis of walnut shell and waste tire with a focus on bio-oil yield quantity and quality In this study, a series of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis experiments on waste tires and walnut shells were conducted under ideal conditions of 500 °C, 10 °C/min heating rate, and 60 min of retention time. Mixture samples with WS/WT: 3/1, 2/2, and 1/3 additive ratios were utilized in co-pyrolysis experiments. The results of the experiments showed that the WS/WT: 3/1 additive ratio samples were necessary to achieve the positive synergistic effect. A 52.57 ± 0.28 % efficient liquid product by mass was produced under these conditions on a dry, ashless basis, which has a significant production potential for the production of high pyrolytic oil. The co-pyrolytic organic phase of the fuel contains around 40 % light naphtha, 10 % heavy naphtha, and 30 % medium distillate by volume, according to atmospheric distillation experiments. Furthermore, it has been discovered that this product can be utilized as a gasoline or gasoline additive due to its IBP-72 °C boiling point range, 20 % distillate percentage, and immediate or inexpensive improvement. When these observations are taken into consideration, it is clear that the co-pyrolytic liquid can be utilized as a raw material input in the production of various of commercial liquid fuels as well as a variety of chemicals with high added value.
