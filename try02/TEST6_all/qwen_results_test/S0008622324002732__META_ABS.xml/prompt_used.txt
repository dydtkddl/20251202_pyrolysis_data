You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of solid carbon from hydrocarbon pyrolysis in molten aluminum This study analyzed the synthesized solid carbon from the pyrolysis of methane, ethane, propane, and natural gas using molten aluminum at 1000 °C. Microscopic examination revealed the formation of spherical structures and capped-carbon nanotubes with average primary particle sizes of 0.18–1.29 μm for the spheres and 0.31–0.39 μm for the capped-carbon nanotubes. Methane and ethane pyrolysis generated spherical carbon exclusively, while propane and natural gas pyrolysis produced spheres and capped-carbon nanotubes. The analysis of interlayer spacing indicated the presence of nanocrystalline properties in all carbon samples. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated broad graphitic phases in methane, ethane, and natural gas-derived carbon, and a broad and sharp graphitic carbon peak in propane-derived carbon. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of graphitic structures and disorder, with capped-carbon nanotubes demonstrating more ordered structures than spheres. The thermogravimetric analysis uncovered differences in oxidation behavior, with the mixture of spherical carbon and capped-carbon nanotubes resulting from propane pyrolysis displaying superior thermal stability compared to samples composed solely of spherical carbon. Additionally, the solid carbon samples from the pyrolysis of methane, ethane, and natural gas displayed a final decomposition curve corresponding with commercial carbon black N991. The surface area analysis unveiled that carbon samples derived from ethane and natural gas exhibited surface areas that were 2.4–5.2 times larger than those of commercial carbon black N991 and graphite flakes. These findings underscore the adaptability of tailoring solid carbon materials by selecting the appropriate feed gas to suit specific applications.
