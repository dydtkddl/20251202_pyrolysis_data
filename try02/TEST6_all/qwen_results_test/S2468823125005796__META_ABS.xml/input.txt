Advances in enzymatic degradation of microplastics: Mechanisms, optimization strategies, and future directions International attention has focused extensively on ocean pollution and the health risks posed by microplastics (MPs) over the past decade, establishing microplastic treatment as a key research area. Enzyme-mediated biocatalytic depolymerization has emerged as an efficient and sustainable alternative for treating and recycling plastics. However, it is complex and time-consuming to discover new microplastic-degrading enzymes or to improve the enzyme immobilization process using conventional methods based on cultivation, omics, or stabilization on traditional supports. From this perspective, bioengineering and artificial intelligence have presented innovative possibilities: (1) optimizing enzyme immobilization processes; (2) Construction/improvement of new enzymes; (3) Integration between technology and a sustainable economy. Therefore, the potential of enzymes and microorganisms as sustainable and economically viable tools for the efficient degradation of microplastics remains largely unexplored. Despite significant progress, challenges related to enzyme stability, large-scale application, and overall polymer degradation efficiency remain.
