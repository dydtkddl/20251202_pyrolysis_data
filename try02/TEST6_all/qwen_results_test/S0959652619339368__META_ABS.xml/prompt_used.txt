You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation to identify the type of waste plastic pyrolysis oil suitable for conversion to diesel engine fuel Plastics for various applications is increasing every year due to outstanding advantages, but after use recycling and disposal have remained a challenge. In this paper, through experiments, we compare properties of pyrolysis oil derived from after use HDPE (High-density polyethylene), LDPE (Low-density polyethylene), PP (Polypropylene)and styrene for their suitability as diesel engine fuel. This experimental study is to identify which type of plastic is suitable for blending with diesel. The physicochemical properties of pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene were tested, tabulated and compared with diesel. The physicochemical properties of polypropylene pyrolysis oil (PPO) were found to be superior to the produced pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, and styrene. The GC-MS(Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)and FT-IR (Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy) were taken for pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene and compared with diesel. PPO showed lower carbon number chain compounds compared to the other three waste plastics. We selected PPO for diesel engine performance and emission trials based on the results of the above tests. PPO was blended in the ratios of 5%, 10% and 15% with diesel. Combustion analysis showed a increase in cylinder pressure in comparison to diesel values. The heat release rates (HRR) were sharply higher than diesel. Both cylinder pressure and HRRvalues for PPO increased as the blend ratios increased. The emission results showed an increase in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC)and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)emissions. The multiple times increase in emissions is due to the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons and higher carbon number of saturated compounds in PPO. GC-MS tests confirmed the presence of such compounds in PPO. To reduce the unsaturation to negligible levels, we will take up future experiments in hydrogenating PPO with various catalysts and test the performance and emissions in diesel engines.
