You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization algorithms for modeling conversion and naphtha yield in the catalytic co-cracking of plastic in HVGO The catalytic co-cracking of 2.5–10 wt% low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO) was carried out in a fixed-bed microactivity test (MAT) unit and studies on the effect of LDPE loading, cracking temperature and nature of zeolite catalyst generated reasonable data that were used to model HVGO/LDPE conversion and naphtha yield using four metaheuristic-based nature inspired optimization algorithms. Using 13 different input parameters into the data mining, less dominant variables with < 0.49 correlation co-efficient to the targets were filtered out. The effect of deterministic based feature on variable filtering prior to modeling stage was conducted for both HVGO/LDPE conversion and naphtha yield. The prediction performance of the developed models in both training and testing was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficients of correlation (R) and determination (R2). Among the four algorithms, GPR-BO showed highest conversion prediction performance for both data training and testing, with MSE = 1.14 × 10−9 and 2.02 × 10−9, RMSE = 3.37 × 10−5 and 4.62 × 10−5, R2 and R = 1.00 respectively. For naphtha yield prediction, the ANN-PSO showed highest performance for both data training and testing, with MSE = 0.020 and 0.0663, RMSE = 0.143 and 0.189, R2 and R = 1.00 respectively.
