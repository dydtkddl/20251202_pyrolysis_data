You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantitative analysis of changes in antioxidant in crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) cable insulation material exposed to heat and gamma radiation Quantitative analysis of the antioxidant poly(1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline) (pTMQ) was conducted on pristine, thermally-aged, and gamma radiation-aged commercial cross-linked polyethylene-(XLPE-)based cable insulation material aged at temperatures 60, 90, and 115 °C, with gamma radiation exposure dose rates of 0, 120, 300, and 540 Gy/h for 15 days. The quantification of antioxidant was performed using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS). Oxidation induction time (OIT) was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and correlation was made between the quantified depletion of antioxidant and measured OIT. It was observed that, in the case of isothermal aging, the quantity of antioxidant and OIT decreased with increasing gamma radiation dose. In the case of samples exposed to the same gamma radiation dose, the quantity of antioxidant and OIT were observed to decrease with increasing aging temperature. Depletion in the quantity of antioxidant relative to that in the pristine material ranged from 7 to 93% for differently aged samples. The measured decline in OIT ranged from 0 to 80%. Change in the quantity of antioxidant in the material was observed to follow the same trend as the change in OIT when the samples were aged under various conditions. The observations are explained in terms of the reaction between the antioxidant and free radicals created during exposure of the samples to thermal and gamma radiation.
