You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-free rapid dehydrogenation kinetics and better regeneration yield of ammonia borane Ammonia borane (AB), one of the promising hydrogen storage materials, is receiving more attention because of its high hydrogen content. However, to act as a sustainable material for hydrogen storage, regeneration from products obtained on dehydrogenation is essential. Regeneration of AB reported in literature involves the use of expensive reagents with high toxicity and environmental impact. In this work, we attempted to aid the dehydrogenation/regeneration process of pure ammonia borane as well as products obtained on thermolysis of AB, using acetone as the dehydrogenation/digestion reagent. During dehydrogenation, a total of 1.7 equivalent of hydrogen was obtained through a thermal and chemical reaction with the resultant formation of tri and tetrasubstituted borate ester. In the current work, a simple method for regeneration of AB is being demonstrated from the dehydrogenated products, which are borate esters, in this case. Using this method, an overall regeneration yield, i.e., from starting material AB→ dehydrogenated products→ regenerated material AB is observed to be 68%. The conversion yield of regenerated AB, starting from dehydrogenated products, was found to be 83%, and that into hydrazine borane (HzB) to be 15% (which can also act as hydrogen source).
