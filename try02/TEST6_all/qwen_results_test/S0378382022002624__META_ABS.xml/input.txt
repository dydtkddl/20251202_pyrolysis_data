Impregnation of different coals and biomass with rapeseed oil for intensifying their ignition in a heated air stream during oil-free boiler start-up Studies were conducted to develop the scientific basis for the use of low-grade solid hydrocarbons and biomass as starting fuel and an energy additive to the main fuel for coal-fired boilers. Char, softwood sawdust, brown and bituminous coals with a particle size of 140–250 μm were used in an air-dry state and after impregnation with rapeseed oil. Analytical studies included surface texture analysis of solid fuel particles, determination of their wetting properties with respect to water and rapeseed oil, thermogravimetric and calorimetric analyses, FTIR analysis of gaseous combustion products, analysis of the elemental composition and texture of the ash surface. Fuel combustion characteristics were studied in conditions of fine fuel particles movement in a heated air stream: 5 m/s, 500–800 °C. Impregnation of solid fuels with oil led to the moisture displacement from the pores of fine particles (oil content in various solid fuels 5.6–22.4%). It increased the combustion completeness of fine particles in a shorter period of time (the ignition delay time reduced by 15–30%) and the thermal effect of the exothermic reaction (by 2.2–18.1%). Oil vapors first ignited in the vicinity of the particle, thereby intensifying the combustion of solid component in fossil fuels.
