You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of hierarchical solidification microstructures in metal additive manufacturing: Challenges and opportunities Metal-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes often produce parts with improved properties compared to conventional manufacturing and metal working routes. However, currently, only a few alloys can be reliably additively manufactured as the vast majority of the alloys in use today are not explicitly designed for this manufacturing route. This is because the highly non-equilibrium nature of melting and rapid solidification phenomena during AM leads to undesirable microstructures with complex growth morphologies and unpredictable microstructural inhomogeneities including solidification defects, leading to unwanted variability in final material properties. In this context, the review article discusses the underlying physical mechanisms of microstructure and associated defects formation during ultrarapid cooling rates typical of AM in order to suggest approaches to minimize and control microstructural heterogeneities for improved printability and microstructure robustness (and hence properties). In particular, the physical effects of cooling rates and alloy parameters on rapidly moving complex solid–liquid interface shapes and the nucleation behavior during non-steady thermal conditions in heterogeneous liquid during AM must be well-understood to control the solidification microstructure and grain morphology. Suitable integration of physics-rich macroscale melt-pool, microstructure, and atomic-scale nucleation models (but benchmarked by experimental measurements) could quantitatively simulate the above hierarchical AM solidification problems that extend across multiple length scales and associated chemical heterogeneities. To address the tremendous computational expense of the above solidification problems toward large part-scale or full-melt-pool simulation, exascale computing hardware and software has been leveraged as a part of the exascale computing project. Further, the AM solidification simulations would guide parameter-microstructure optimization via data-driven modeling and, ultimately, alloy and processing development to suit various envisaged applications in the AM community.
