Advances and significances of organic nanomaterials in optoelectronic applications The remarkable mechanical strength, extensive surface areas, and adaptable optical characteristics of organic nanomaterials—such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene—make them ideal for use in nanocomposites, flexible electronics, and optoelectronic devices. But obstacles including thermal and chemical stability, environmental worries, and scalability problems prevent them from being widely used in real-world applications. By addressing these issues with better synthesis and manufacturing methods, these materials' stability, repeatability, and integration may be enhanced, opening the door for their profitable commercialization. The potential of organic nanomaterials to advance optoelectronics is investigated in this review paper.
