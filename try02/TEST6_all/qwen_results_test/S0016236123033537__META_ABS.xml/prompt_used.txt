You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization and performance evaluation of co-pyrolysis oil from waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene as a potential diesel substitute In this experimental study, the co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene in different proportions was conducted at 500 °C using a fixed bed type reactor, and synthesized oils were tested to determine their physical and chemical properties, aiming to evaluate their potential as alternative fuel sources. Promising properties closely resembling those of transportation-grade diesel, such as low density (759.1–848.9 kg/m3), higher calorific value (42.33–46.22 MJ/kg), low oxygen content (1.02 %), and zero sulphur content, were observed in the obtained oils. To assess the performance, combustion, and emissions of the co-pyrolysis oil blended with diesel, three different blends (D90P10, D80P20, D70P30) were analyzed at various engine loads. The results revealed that the brake thermal efficiency of the engine increased from 26.2 % to 27.4 % for the D90P10 blend under high load conditions. At top load conditions, the blend D90P10 exhibits a maximum reduction in HC, smoke, and CO emissions by 19.3 %, 17.3 %, and 5.6 %, while NO have increased by 42.85 %. However, as the proportion of the co-pyrolysis oil in the blend increased, the NO emissions decreased. Hence, co-pyrolysis oil blending upto 30 % can be considered a potential alternative to reduce diesel consumption.
