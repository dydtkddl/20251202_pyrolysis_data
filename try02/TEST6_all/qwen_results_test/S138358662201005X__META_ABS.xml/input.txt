Hydrogen sulfide capture and removal technologies: A comprehensive review of recent developments and emerging trends Hydrogen sulfide is a highly flammable, acutely toxic, and extremely hazardous gas that must be captured and removed from a number of important gaseous and liquid streams. This long-standing challenge of capturing H2S has seen the rise of different materials used in different types of technologies over the years. Some of the well-known examples are alkanolamines used as absorbents and metal oxides used as adsorbents. This work presents an exhaustive review of the latest developments and emerging materials in this field, including ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents, zeolites, carbon-based materials, metal organic frameworks, polymeric membranes, biological methods, advanced oxidation processes, etc. In addition to a detailed discussion of the state of the art, this review also provides a general technology map and identifies opportunities and challenges to guide future work.
