You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of PET bottles into carbonaceous adsorbents for Pb(II) removal from aqueous solutions via KOH activation In this study, we present a novel approach to repurpose waste Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a prominent contributor to global plastic usage, for the synthesis of efficient adsorbents via facial pyrolysis. The as-synthesized adsorbents were applied for the removal of lead (Pb(II)) ions in aqueous solution. Controlled batch experiments at pH 5 with 0.075 g of adsorbent at room temperature (20 °C) were conducted to measure Pb(II) adsorption capacities (mg/g) and fitted on isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin) and kinetics models (Pseudo-First order, Pseudo-Second order, and Elovich). Thermodynamic experiments conducted at four different temperatures (293 K, 303 K, 313 K, and 323 K) provided enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy change parameters, explaining the Pb(II) adsorption behaviors on PET-based adsorbents. The activation process involving KOH, followed by carbonization, yielded adsorbents with exceptional surface areas, pore volumes, and elevated oxygen contents (up to 22.8 %). The best adsorbent exhibited superior performance, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 219.7 mg/g within a rapid equilibrium time of 15 min. The adsorption behavior adhered well to the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.999) and Pseudo-Second Order kinetics model (R2 = 0.999). Furthermore, C600K600 displayed outstanding reusability, with negligible efficiency reduction (<5 %) even after five consecutive cycles. These results underscore the successful conversion of PET waste into a low-cost and highly effective adsorbent, offering a promising solution for sustainable waste management.
