Surface engineering for cellulose as a boosted Layer-by-Layer assembly: Excellent flame retardancy and improved durability with introduction of bio-based “molecular glue” Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly was attractive as a versatile tool to address the flammability of cotton, while the washing fastness of LbL coating stayed an issue. Aiming to tackle this issue, LbL layers consisted of phenylphosphonic acid (PHA) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was deposited on polydopamine (PDA)-coated cotton. The prepared cotton reached 31.4% of limiting oxygen index (LOI), and extinguished immediately after removing the ignitor. Peak of heat release rate (pHRR) attenuated around 36 % compared with pure cotton. A combined barrier and quenching mechanisms were proposed. Moreover, enhanced washing durability (24.1% of LOI) was achieved even after 50 detergent laundering cycles. A facile, boosted LbL approach with proposed π − π stacking interactions between PDA abundant aromatic structures and benzene ring in PHA from LbL layers, is first to put forward to construct durable efficient flame retardant (FR) cotton. This work attempted to enlighten more thoughts and design for durable FR cotton fabrics.
