Experiment and molecular-level kinetic modeling study of catalytic pyrolysis of heavy oil to light olefin In this study, the fluid catalytic pyrolysis reaction patterns of two heavy oils under typical processes were studied, three molecular-level kinetic models were developed based on the structural unit and bond-electron matrix framework, these models were used to systematically and quantitatively reveal key reaction information at the molecular level for different heavy oil feedstocks and processes. The kinetic parameters of the modelings were trained and optimized with experimental data, the predicted values of the product yield were consistent with the experimental data. Model calculations revealed that, the nature of conventional process optimization for heavy oil catalytic pyrolysis is to promote ring opening, ring side chain and olefin cracking, and slightly inhibit the side reactions such as hydrogen transfer, olefin polymerization and olefin cyclization. However, heavy oil cracking is more limited by side reactions, the light olefin yield improved about 69–81% after eliminating the heavy oil cracking side reactions, which are insufficiently inhibited by current reaction systems, and heavy oil catalytic pyrolysis technology is expected to improve considerably in this regard.
