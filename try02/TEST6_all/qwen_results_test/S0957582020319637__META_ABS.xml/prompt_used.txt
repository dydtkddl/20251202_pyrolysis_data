You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atomic insights into the thermal runaway process of hydrogen peroxide and 1,3,5-trimethybenzene mixture: Combining ReaxFF MD and DFT methods The explosive hazard of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organics mixtures had drawn much attention, but the mechanism is still unclear. In this work, the atomic insights into the thermal runaway process of H2O2 and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) mixture was conducted using a new approach of combining reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) and density function theory (DFT). The detailed reaction pathways were obtained through ReaxFF MD. The kinetic and thermal properties of main reaction steps were examined by DFT. This work divided the thermal runaway process into two stages. In stage I, H2O2 molecules were decomposed first to generate ·OOH and ·OH free radicals. The ·OH radicals induced the initial oxidation of TMB molecular through H-abstraction and ·OH-combine reaction steps with the highest thermal energy of 921.76 kJ/mol released, evoking the opening and cracking of benzene ring. In stage II, once the generated small molecules were further oxidized, the reactions showed a runaway for the massive thermal energy released, which explains the mechanism of larger potential risk of H2O2-organics mixture. Notably, ·OH is the most crucial free radical carrier for the whole reaction process, the explosion hazard will be inhibited or weakened if the concentration of ·OH radical is controlled. It is expected that this work will help researchers and industrial practitioners to better understand the intrinsic thermal hazard of H2O2-organics, and provide valuable guidance for the further development of efficient explosion suppression methods.
