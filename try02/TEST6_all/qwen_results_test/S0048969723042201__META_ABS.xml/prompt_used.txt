You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of C5-C12 olefins by catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene with MCM-41 in CO2/N2 The current high volume of plastic waste, but low recycling rate, has led to environmental pollution and wasted energy. Greenhouse gas CO2 can facilitate thermal cracking to dehydrogenate waste plastics, and has potential value for producing olefins. In this work, the pyrolysis properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and Py-GC/MS. The effect of the pyrolysis atmosphere, using N2 or CO2, with various MCM-41 catalyst ratios on pyrolysis product distribution, were investigated. The experimental results show that the olefin selectivity under a N2 atmosphere was from 30.32 % to 44.66 % which increased as the MCM-41 catalyst was increased. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the olefin selectivity reached a maximum of 60.39 %. The Boudouard reaction was also enhanced by the introduction of CO2. The carbon content of the subdivided olefins showed that in CO2, the promotion of C5-C12 olefins was relatively weak when non-catalyzed or at low catalytic ratios, but increased significantly at higher MCM-41 catalyst ratios. With a ratio of LDPE: MCM-41 = 5:4, the CO2 atmosphere showed the greatest promotion of C5-C12 olefins over N2, with an increase of 14.66 % compared to N2, representing a 48.54 % yield of the liquid product. Producing C5-C12 olefins under these conditions maximized energy efficiency. These results show that catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE under a CO2 atmosphere has great potential to produce C5-C12 olefins, which can be used to produce high-value chemicals such as naphtha and gasoline. This opens new opportunities for the chemical recycling of plastic waste.
