You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prospects for the utilization of bio-oil-derived chemicals generated via co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) The global concern about plastic is a matter of great importance. Coprocessing biomass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through pyrolysis can represent a strategy to reuse these materials, transforming them into products of industrial interest. Thus, this study aims to understand the influence of the co-pyrolysis of biomass and PET on bio-oil (BO). The PET quantities used were 0 %, 15 %, and 25 % of the eucalyptus biomass dry basis. The co-pyrolysis was performed in a fixed-bed reactor in a low-oxygen atmosphere without gas entry at a final temperature of 450°C and three heating rates (1, 3, and 5°C.min−1). The liquid fraction underwent double distillation, producing purified bio-oil (BOP) with yields of 54 %, 57 %, and 55 %, respectively, influenced solely by the heating rates of 1, 3, and 5°C min−1. After purification, BOP's pH, density, and viscosity were analyzed. The chemical composition of BOP was subject to GC-MS analysis. The addition of PET and the variation in heating rate influenced the composition of the BOP produced. The liquid density decreased as the PET proportion in the biomass increased. The heating rate increase reduced BOP's pH from 2.75 to 2.61. Therefore, lower heating rates and PET proportions tend to increase the viscosity of BOP. Ketones were the most representative organic compounds in all evaluated materials, followed by phenols, furans, and pyrans.
