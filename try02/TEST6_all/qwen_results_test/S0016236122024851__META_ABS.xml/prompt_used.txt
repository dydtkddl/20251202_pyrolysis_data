You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combustion kinetics and fuel performance of tackifying resins by TG-FTIR and DFT analysis Combustion kinetics and fuel performance of tackifying resins such as glycerol ester of colophony (GEC), glycerol ester of hydrogenated colophony (GEHC), C9 petroleum resin (C9PR) and hydrogenated C9 petroleum resin (HC9PR) were studied. Non-isothermal thermal analysis was performed in an air atmosphere, and the combustion characteristic, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Results show that all the resins studied have good combustion performance and environmental characteristics, and their experimental calorific values are 1.15–1.54 times of standard coal-equivalent (29.31 MJ/kg), indicating that tackifying resins and their corresponding wastes are promising fuel for generating energy. Furthermore, based on the isoconversional and master plots methods, it was found that the combustion of different resins was a kinetically complicated reaction, but the R3 model had an acceptable fitting effect in the whole combustion process. TG-FTIR and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that colophony-based resins tend to degrade/burn the branched chains first and then the tricyclic phenanthrene structures, while petroleum resins degrade/burn the CC bonds on the backbone first and then the aromatic compounds, and the volatiles are mainly composed of H2O, CH4, CO2, CO, aromatic compounds and carbonyl derivatives.
