You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing hydrogen production and biochar recovery from algal biomass: A novel techno-economic synergism with gelatinous digestate The fermentation of algal biomass (AB) for H2 production suffers from inefficient acidogenic metabolic pathway activities and the generation of digestate as a source of secondary pollution. This study focuses on the supplementation of AB with gelatinous digestate (GD) rich in hydrolytic enzymes, macro/micro-nutrients, and hydrogen producers, followed by management of the solid fraction digestate for biochar recovery. The dark fermentation of different AB:GD mixing ratios was conducted in batch mode at 20 rpm rotation speed and 32 °C for 320 h. The AB:GD composition of 50: 50 (w/w) exhibited the best hydrogenase enzyme activity of 0.45 ± 0.02 mg MB reduced/min and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of 388 ± 23 mg/gVS. Integrating AB with GD facilitated the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, i.e., α-amylase (128.9 ± 7.7 U/100 mL), protease (217.0 ± 13.7 U/mg), and xylanase (134.0 ± 8.2 U/100 mL), maximizing the conversion efficiencies of carbohydrate and protein into H2 (528 ± 31 mL/g carbohydrate removed and 599 ± 34 mL/g protein removed, respectively). This AB–GD synergistic interaction increased the relative abundances of bacterial populations responsible for the conversion of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) into H2, i.e., Proteobacteria (29.1 %), Firmicutes (17.4 %), Actinobacteria (17.3 %), Chloroflexi (12.9 %), Bacteroidetes (9.4 %), Planctomycetes (8.4 %), and Acidobacteria (2.5 %). The fermented digestate obtained after H2 harvesting was subjected to pyrolysis at 650 °C for 2 h. The produced biochar involved multiple functional groups, 52.3 % crystallinity index, and 0.7 O/C molar ratio, exhibiting a material half-life of <100 yr. Based on the estimated H2 (1.970 mol/mol glucose) and biochar (0.33 g/gbiomass) yields, a waste-to-energy facility was designed, signifying the generation of 49.5 m3 H2/d and 11.8 kg biochar/d from an organic load of 220.5 kg COD/d. The techno-economic estimation of this route revealed profits from H2 and biochar sales and the associated carbon credit revenue with a 6.7-yr payback period. Overall, the AB–GD synergism could maximize green bio-fuel productivity while maintaining a circular economy approach.
