You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vacuum pyrolysis of PVC I. Kinetic study Vacuum pyrolysis of PVC has been studied emphasizing two aspects: the kinetics of PVC pyrolysis reactions and the yields of pyrolysis products. The purpose of the kinetic study is to identify each apparent reaction involved in PVC pyrolysis. Three stages of weight loss have been evidenced by TG analysis during PVC decomposition both under vacuum and in nitrogen atmosphere, while in most previous studies carried out under similar conditions only two stages were detected. The corresponding temperature intervals of these three stages are: 200–320°C; 250–375°C and 375–520°C. Based on the TG results, a three-apparent-reactions model is proposed. Kinetic parameters and conversion factors have been calculated for each apparent reaction with this model including all three stages of decomposition. Some results are in good accordance with literature data. Bench scale PVC pyrolysis tests were carried out to collect the pyrolysis products from each single apparent reaction. These products were analyzed and a correlation with TG results was made in order to assign these results to a certain change of the PVC structure. These findings provide new insights into the PVC thermal decomposition and useful data for controlling the release of HCl during PVC pyrolysis have been made available.
