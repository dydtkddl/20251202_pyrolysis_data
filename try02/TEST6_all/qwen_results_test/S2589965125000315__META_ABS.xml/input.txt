Preparation, improvement, and application of metal–organic framework-based sensing materials for gas leakage and emission: A review Industrial gas leaks and flue gas emissions pose significant threats to the safety of industrial operations and the atmospheric ecological environment. Traditional gas sensing materials often struggle to meet the challenges posed by complex industrial environments. Recently, metal-organic framework (MOF)-based gas sensing materials have garnered significant attention in industrial gas detection due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and tunable properties. The exponential increase in related publications highlights the growing research interest in this field. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the advantages of various types of metal-organic frameworks and their derivatives for detecting industrial gas leaks and flue gas emissions, alongside an introduction of representative MOF synthesis methods. Furthermore, the primary sensing mechanisms of MOF-based gas sensing materials and strategies for enhancing the sensing performance are summarized. The current state of MOF-based gas sensing materials in industrial gas detection is also discussed. Finally, the potential limitations, existing challenges, and future directions of MOF-based industrial gas sensing materials are systematically analyzed, with suggestions for addressing these challenges to advance industrial gas detection technologies.
