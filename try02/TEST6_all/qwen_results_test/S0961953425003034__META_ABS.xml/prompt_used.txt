You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct conversion of sawdust into biobased aviation fuel precursor via atmospheric catalytic hydropyrolysis process This research aimed to develop catalyst and technology design to selectively convert sawdust into bio jet fuel (BJF) components via ex-situ catalytic hydropyrolysis (CHP) process. Design of catalyst configuration was carried out considering the fact that an efficient catalyst for biomass pyrolysis process requires (i) an improved diffusion rate of reactants/products to and from the catalyst active sites, (ii) suppression of secondary reactions, and (iii) prevention of deactivation mechanisms. Hence, sawdust was hydropyrolyzed in a customized continuous pyrolysis system and then the pyrolysis vapors were upgraded while passing through a bed of a well-designed guard catalyst (CatG) followed sequentially by a suitable hydroconversion catalyst (CatH). The morphology and chemical structure of CatG and CatH were synergistically designed to enhance the selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons in the range of jet fuel chemicals for 75 %. Effects of different process parameters, such as structure and morphology of CatG, catalyst upgrading temperature (350 and 400 °C), pyrolysis gas environment (N2, H2/N2, and air/N2), concentration of CatG active sites (8, 17, 33, and 50 wt%), and durability of catalysts, on the process efficiency concerning reaction selectivity towards BJFs, heating value of the pyrolysis products, and carbon efficiency of the whole process were investigated. Specifically, the durability of combined catalysts was evaluated for four times and the results showed that the catalysts combination resulted in similar selectivity to BJFs during recycling tests. The maximum selectivity to BJFs (42 %) was achieved at 400 °C, WHSV 3 h−1, reaction time 3 h, carrier gas H2/N2, and CatG 33 wt%.
