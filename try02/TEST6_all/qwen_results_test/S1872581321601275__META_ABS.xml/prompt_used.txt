You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse by zeolite catalyst for the production of multi-walled carbon nanotubes Recently, the disposal of waste by beneficial and environmentally friendly methods has attracted great attention. In this work, we have studied the production of high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which have remarkable applications by catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) as an agricultural waste using a two-stage process. Various reaction factors including the effects of zeolite types (HZSM-5, HMOR, and HY), pyrolysis temperatures (450−700°C), and SCB/ZSM-5 ratios (3−12) on SCB pyrolysis were investigated to generate CNTs from pyrolysis products. A Co-Mo/MgO catalyst was used for growing CNTs via the decomposition of pyrolysis products. The morphological structure and quality of CNTs were characterized using TEM and Raman spectroscopy, while the fresh Co-Mo/MgO catalyst was characterized by XRD and TPR analyses. The results showed that zeolite type, pyrolysis temperature, and SCB/ZSM-5 ratio had significant effects on the CNTs yield. The optimum carbon yield (24.9%) was achieved using the HZSM-5 catalyst at the pyrolysis temperature of 500°C and with the SCB/ZSM-5 ratio of 6. TEM observations confirmed the growth of bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) and carbon nano-onions (CNOs) in different proportions according to the reaction parameters. Also, CNTs with the largest diameter distribution range (7−76 nm) were produced using the SCB/ZSM-5 ratio of 6. Raman spectra demonstrated the production of high-quality CNTs under all studied conditions.
