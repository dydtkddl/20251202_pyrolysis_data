You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Initial reaction mechanisms of cellulose pyrolysis revealed by ReaxFF molecular dynamics Mechanism investigation of cellulose pyrolysis is remarkably useful for efficient utilization of biomass. In this paper, a new methodology rooted in the first GPU enabled ReaxFF MD simulation program (GMD-Reax) and the unique cheminformatics based reaction analysis tool (VARxMD) was employed to investigate the initial reaction mechanism of cellulose pyrolysis. Both the overall spectrum product evolution and underlying detailed chemical reactions of cellulose pyrolysis have been revealed. A reaction scheme of cellulose pyrolysis with detailed reaction pathways for major pyrolyzates has been obtained that is not readily accessible by experiments. The simulated evolution tendencies of the major pyrolysis products (glycolaldehyde, levoglucosan and water) with temperature at 500–1400K agrees well with the Py-GC/MS experimental observations at 673–1073K. Compared with the large temperature discrepancy imposed by the widely used simulation strategy of artificially increased temperature in ReaxFF MD, the very close temperature range between the simulations and experiments suggests that cellulose is a good model system to validate the ReaxFF force field in predicting the behavior and chemistry events in pyrolysis of complex molecular systems. The computational approach of large model simulation facilitated by efficient computation of GMD-Reax, and chemical reaction analysis capability of VARxMD can shed new light on the detailed chemical mechanisms of pyrolysis for cellulose and other biomass.
