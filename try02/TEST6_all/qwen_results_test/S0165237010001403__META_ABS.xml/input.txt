Experimental study on the thermal decomposition of 2H-heptafluoropropane This is an extension study of the thermal decomposition of 2H-heptafluoropropane (HFP), mainly aiming at investigating the relationship between pyrolysis characteristics and reaction time, and evaluating the production of hydrogen fluoride (HF). The results indicate that reaction temperatures have obvious effects on the decomposition of HFP. Pure HFP does not decompose at 400, 500 and 600°C. It starts to decompose at about 640°C, markedly breaks down at 700°C and exhibits intense decompositions at 800°C; meanwhile, coke formation was observed on the inner surface of the reactor. Moreover, it can also be found that the reaction time has obvious effect on the thermal decomposition processes of HFP. From 700 to 800°C the decomposition becomes increasingly drastic, and the concentration of HF produced highly depends on reaction temperature and time. This hints that when the total amount of HFP remains constant during practical application, the promotion of the spraying current capacity and the reduction of spraying time can reduce the production amount of HF, which can further lessen the harm to the personnel and the environment.
