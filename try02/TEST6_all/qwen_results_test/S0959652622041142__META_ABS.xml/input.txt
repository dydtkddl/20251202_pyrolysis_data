The enhancement mechanism of the microwave-assisted toluene desorption for activated carbon regeneration based on the constructive interference Reducing energy consumption is a crucial issue in adsorbent regeneration process, while regulating temperature distribution during regeneration is expected to solve this problem. In this study, we propose a novel enhancement mechanism based on the enhanced constructive interference for microwave-assisted regeneration of the activated carbons via a facile method for preparing activated carbons. We prepared activated carbons with similar adsorption characteristics (qe ≈ 0.20 g g−1 with a toluene concentration of 376 mg m−3) and different dielectric properties (29.96 95%) and reduced energy consumption (∼50% of maximum value) in AC-450 with an input power of 40 W. A series of experiments and numerical simulations revealed that the reduced energy consumption was due to the enhanced constructive interference governed by dielectric properties. Further, a decreased dimensionless parameter affected by dielectric properties, f p, can enhance constructive interference. In summary, this work proposes an enhancement mechanism based on the enhanced constructive interference for microwave heating technology and provides a facile method for reducing energy consumption in microwave-assisted regeneration.
