Oxidative depolymerization of lignin in a Fixed-Bed tubular membrane reactor Oxidative depolymerization is a crucial step for converting lignin into valuable phenolic monomers and oligomers. However, the resulting products are molecular weight heterogeneous and require further fractionation to increase the value. This study developed a fixed-bed tubular membrane reactor for the oxidative depolymerization of industrial lignin, aiming to obtain depolymerized lignin rich in phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups with low heterogeneity. In the proposed reactor, the depolymerization products were separated from the catalyst and lignin repolymerization products through the tubular membrane, thereby reducing the difficulty of subsequent separation treatment. Response surface methodology was used to study the effects of process parameters on yield, and the molecular weight of the products as well as the contents of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were analyzed by GPC and potentiometric titration. In addition, FT-IR, 2D-HSQC, and UV–vis spectroscopy were employed to investigate the structural changes of lignin after depolymerization. The results showed that the molecular weight and heterogeneity of the depolymerization products were significantly reduced, and contained more phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, exhibiting higher visible light transparency. This work indicates that lignin alkaline oxidation in a tubular membrane reactor is an effective strategy to obtain high-value oxidatively depolymerized lignin.
