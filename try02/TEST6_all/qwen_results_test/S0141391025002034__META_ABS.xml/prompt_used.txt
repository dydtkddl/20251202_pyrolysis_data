You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal decomposition mechanism of poly(vinyl butyral) with random structure revealed through TG-FTIR-MS, GC-MS, and SVUV PIMS Understanding thermal decomposition mechanism of polymers with a random structure is essential for both academic research and industrial applications, but remains a complex and less studied area due to its complexity. In this study, we investigated the oxygen-free thermal decomposition behavior of poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB), a polymer with random structure, using a combination of thermogravimetry-Fourier infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV PIMS). Specific structures of dozens of products and some corresponding free radicals during decomposition were successfully identified and distinguished in detail for the first time. According to the temperature dependent evolution behavior, the products can be categorized into several types: “type A product” (n-butanal), “type B products” (lower aldehydes, lower ketones, alkenals, alkenones, etc.), and “type C products” (alkenes, butanoic acid, aromatic and cyclic aliphatic compounds, etc.). Their source reactions leading to the formation of each product type were thoroughly discussed respectively. A comprehensive scheme of the thermal decomposition mechanism of PVB was proposed, which cannot be simply classified into any of the three major thermal decomposition categories. Our work provides valuable insights into the thermal decomposition mechanism of PVB and offers a valuable approach for studying the thermal decomposition behavior of other polymers with random structures.
