Statistical modeling of activated carbon production from spent mushroom compost Activated carbons were prepared from spent mushroom compost using H3PO4 as activating agent. The effects of temperature (°C), impregnant ratio (H3PO4/biomass) and time (min) were determined by using Response Surface Methodology. The micropore area is above 75% of the total surface area. The activated carbon which has the maximum adsorption capacity with the largest specific surface area (1419.108m2/g) was produced at the experimental conditions T =450°C, IR=3.5:1g/g and t =50min. The maximum activated carbon yield (56.2%) was obtained at 350°C with an impregnant ratio of 1.5:1g/g for 30min.
