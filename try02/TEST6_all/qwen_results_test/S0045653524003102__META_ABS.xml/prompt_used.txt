You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in nanotechnology-based modifications of micro/nano PET plastics for green energy applications Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic is an omnipresent synthetic polymer in our lives, which causes negative impacts on the ecosystem. It is crucial to take mandatory action to control the usage and sustainable disposal of PET plastics. Recycling plastics using nanotechnology offers potential solutions to the challenges associated with traditional plastic recycling methods. Nano-based degradation techniques improve the degradation process through the influence of catalysts. It also plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling processes and modifying them into value-added products. The modified PET waste plastics can be utilized to manufacture batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, and so on. The waste PET modification methods have massive potential for research, which can play major role in removing post-consumer plastic waste. The present review discusses the effects of micro/nano plastics in terrestrial and marine ecosystems and its impacts on plants and animals. Briefly, the degradation and bio-degradation methods in recent research were explored. The depolymerization methods used for the production of monomers from PET waste plastics were discussed in detail. Carbon nanotubes, fullerene, and graphene nanosheets synthesized from PET waste plastics were delineated. The reuse of nanotechnologically modified PET waste plastics for potential green energy storage products, such as batteries, supercapacitors, and sensors were presented in this review.
