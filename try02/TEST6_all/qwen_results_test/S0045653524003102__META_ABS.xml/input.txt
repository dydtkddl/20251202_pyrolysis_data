Recent advances in nanotechnology-based modifications of micro/nano PET plastics for green energy applications Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic is an omnipresent synthetic polymer in our lives, which causes negative impacts on the ecosystem. It is crucial to take mandatory action to control the usage and sustainable disposal of PET plastics. Recycling plastics using nanotechnology offers potential solutions to the challenges associated with traditional plastic recycling methods. Nano-based degradation techniques improve the degradation process through the influence of catalysts. It also plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of recycling processes and modifying them into value-added products. The modified PET waste plastics can be utilized to manufacture batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, and so on. The waste PET modification methods have massive potential for research, which can play major role in removing post-consumer plastic waste. The present review discusses the effects of micro/nano plastics in terrestrial and marine ecosystems and its impacts on plants and animals. Briefly, the degradation and bio-degradation methods in recent research were explored. The depolymerization methods used for the production of monomers from PET waste plastics were discussed in detail. Carbon nanotubes, fullerene, and graphene nanosheets synthesized from PET waste plastics were delineated. The reuse of nanotechnologically modified PET waste plastics for potential green energy storage products, such as batteries, supercapacitors, and sensors were presented in this review.
