You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multicomponent and continuous adsorption of neonicotinoid pesticides identified in the EU Watch Lists onto mesoporous and biogenic activated carbon The environmental impact of pesticides, together with the increasing regulatory framework on sewage sludge disposal, has raised a great political and social concern. Neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (THM), and acetamiprid (ACT), have been included among the main emerging pollutants on the latest EU Watch Lists derived from Directive 2008/105/EC. This research aims at valorising an industrial sludge through the synthesis of a biogenic activated carbon for the continuous adsorption of the aforementioned plaguicides from multicomponent aqueous solutions. AC-Industrial2 was prepared by combining chemical and physical activation, resulting in a mesoporous material with a high surface area (SBET = 750 m2∙g−1) and a strong affinity for the micropollutants tested. The sludge-derived adsorbent achieved maximum adsorption capacity values at equilibrium of 124.3, 124.4 and 153.1 mg∙g−1 for ACT, THM and IMD, respectively. Therefore, this material not only presented similar removal yields to those obtained with the commercial material (AC-F400), but also it considerably favoured the adsorption kinetics due to its great mesoporosity contribution. The best fitting of experimental kinetic data was found by using pseudo-first order model, while Freundlich model successfully fitted most of the equilibrium adsorption isotherms. The breakthrough behaviour of the multicomponent fixed-bed system for AC-Industrial2 was related to the pesticides' hydrophobicity, rather than the molecular volume of the pollutants. Additionally, an overshooting phenomenon was noticed for the weakest adsorbable components (THM and ACT). The sorbent developed in this work allowed a bed utilisation in the range 51–67.2 %, whereas the commercial material led to values between 7.0 and 8.3 %. This fact, together with the complete and efficient regeneration of the novel material by a Fenton process, highlighted its excellent reusability and stability for scale-up.
