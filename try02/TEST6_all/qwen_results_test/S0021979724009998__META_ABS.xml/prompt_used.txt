You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pb nanospheres encapsulated in metal–organic frameworks-derived porous carbon as anode for high-performance sodium-ion batteries Alloying-type anode materials are considered promising candidates for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities. However, their application is limited by the severe capacity decay stemming from dramatic volume changes during Na+ insertion/extraction processes. Here, Pb nanospheres encapsulated in a carbon skeleton (Pb@C) were successfully synthesized via a facile metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived method and used as anodes for SIBs. The nanosized Pb particles are uniformly incorporated into the porous carbon framework, effectively mitigating volume changes and enhancing Na+ ion transport during discharging/charging. Benefiting from this unique architecture, a reversible capacity of 334.2 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 is achieved after 6000 cycles corresponding to an impressive 88.2 % capacity retention and a minimal capacity loss of 0.00748 % per cycle. Furthermore, a high-performance full sodium-ion battery of Pb@C//NVPF was constructed, demonstrating a high energy density of 291 Wh kg−1 and power density of 175 W kg−1. This facile MOFs-derived method offers insights into the design of high-capacity alloy-type anode materials using Pb sources, opening up new possibilities for innovative approaches to Pb recycling and pollution prevention.
