You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The influence of the compositions and structures of Cu-ZrO2 catalysts on the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH In this paper, Cu-ZrO2 catalysts were prepared and used for CH3OH synthesis through CO2 hydrogenation to clarify the influence of their compositions and structures on the catalytic performance. We mainly address the problem that how the oxygen vacancy and Cu-ZrO2 interface affect the catalytic performance jointly, because the previous articles only pay attention to the influence of the interface on CH3OH synthesis. Combined with experiments and various structural characterizations, we propose that oxygen vacancies play an essential role in CO2 activation instead of the interface; CH3OH selectivity is determined by the low-valence Cu species (Cu0 and Cu+) and ZrO2 interface (the main factor), and the pore size. The in-situ DRIFTS demonstrates that the conversion of *HCOO active intermediates to *CH3O on the optimal catalyst (CuZr-1) is faster. DFT calculations also shed light on the importance of oxygen vacancy in CO2 adsorption and the formate pathway. We believe this work provides useful insight for researchers to design highly efficient Cu-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH.
