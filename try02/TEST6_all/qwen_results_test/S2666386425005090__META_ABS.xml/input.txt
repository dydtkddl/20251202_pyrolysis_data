Advancing chemical recycling for waste plastic conversion Plastics are indispensable in modern society, yet their rapid production and accumulation create urgent environmental and resource challenges. Because they are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, plastics can be viewed as a resource rather than waste. This perspective highlights chemical upcycling as a promising strategy to depolymerize plastics into intermediates for repolymerization or to convert them into high-value products. We emphasize advances in catalysts and processes that improve yield and selectivity while lowering energy input, alongside the integration of renewable electricity and solar energy to enhance recycling efficiency. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) are critical for evaluating feasibility, sustainability, and scalability. Finally, we outline how collaboration among researchers, industry, policymakers, and the public—through shared infrastructure, incentives, and cross-sector partnerships—can accelerate the transition to a circular plastic economy.
