High and rapid hydrogen release from thermolysis of ammonia borane near PEM fuel cell operating temperatures: Effect of quartz wool Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB), containing 19.6 wt% hydrogen, is a promising hydrogen storage material for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM FC) powered vehicles. We recently demonstrated that using quartz wool, the highest H2 yield (2.1–2.3H2 equivalent) values were obtained by neat AB thermolysis near PEM FC operating temperatures, along with rapid kinetics, without the use of either catalyst or chemical additives. It was found that quartz wool minimizes sample expansion and facilitates the production of diamoniate of diborane (DADB), which is a key intermediate for the release of hydrogen from AB. It was also found that only trace amount of ammonia (<10 ppm) is produced during dehydrogenation reaction and spent AB products are found to be polyborazylene-like species, which can be efficiently regenerated using currently demonstrated methods. The results indicate that our proposed method is the most promising one available in the literature to-date for hydrogen storage, and could be used in PEM FC based vehicle applications.
