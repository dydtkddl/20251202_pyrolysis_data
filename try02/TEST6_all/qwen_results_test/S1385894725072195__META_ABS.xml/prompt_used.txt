You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ni/Nb2O5 as a noble-metal-free catalyst for the chemical upcycling of waste polyolefin plastics The resource utilization of waste polyolefin plastics is expected to be achieved through upgrading and reconstruction processes, but the primary scientific challenge lies in the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts. In this paper, we present Ni nanoparticles supported on Nb₂O₅ with tunable acid sites (Ni/Nb2O5-T) as noble-metal-free catalysts for the upcycling of waste plastics. These catalysts efficiently facilitate a one-pot, solvent-free catalytic hydrogenolysis of waste plastics, converting them into aromatic-free, highly branched alkane aviation fuels under mild conditions. Notably, the bifunctional Ni/Nb2O5-400 catalyst, characterized by highly dispersed metallic Ni sites and strong Brønsted acid sites, promotes key reactions such as hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, skeletal rearrangements, and β-scission of linear low-density polyethylene. This process achieves 100 % conversion with a yield of over 80 % for liquid products at 250 °C and 3 MPa H₂ for 4 h. The carbon distribution of the resulting liquid fuels primarily ranges from C6 to C18, with 71 % composed of isoparaffins, highlighting them as promising candidates for aviation fuels. Additionally, the Ni/Nb2O5-400 catalyst exhibits versatile activity, delivering high yields of highly branched alkane aviation fuels through the chemical upcycling of various types of waste polyolefin plastics. A techno-economic analysis further confirms that this Ni-catalyzed plastic-to-fuel process offers significant economic advantages, underscoring its potential for industrial-scale implementation.
