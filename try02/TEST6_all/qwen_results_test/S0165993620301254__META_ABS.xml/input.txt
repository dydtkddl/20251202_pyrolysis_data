The search for organic compounds with TMAH thermochemolysis: From Earth analyses to space exploration experiments Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is one of the most popular methylation reagents that have been increasingly used for the detection of organic compounds within a wide range of samples, such as soil, coal, lacquer, lignin, polymers and for in situ analysis of solid samples by space experiments. The analytical methods and instruments, experimental conditions, and the qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds using TMAH thermochemolysis for the last 10 years were reviewed; additionally, the mechanism of TMAH thermochemolysis and TMAH degradation are overviewed herein. The objective of this paper is to give a broad view of the TMAH thermochemolysis analysis, to demonstrate how the technique can be used for the detection of organics on Mars and other planets, and to promote cooperation between different disciplines which may use thermochemolysis.
