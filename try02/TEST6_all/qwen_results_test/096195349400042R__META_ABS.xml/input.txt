Measurement and modeling of lignin pyrolysis Pyrolysis of lignin is one approach that has been investigated to upgrade this material into higher value products. However, there have been relatively few efforts to quantitatively model these reactions. This paper describes a methodology for modeling lignin pyrolysis which has been extensively developed for related materials like coal. The samples are characterized using pyrolysis experiments under a standard set of conditions, where the products are analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy and Field Ionization Mass Spectrometry (FIMS). Solvent extraction experiments are done to determine the extractables yields and elemental analysis is done to further constrain the model. One lignin, produced from ethanol/water extraction of mixed hardwoods, was selected for the application of this modeling approach. The model was able to qualitatively predict the tar molecular weight distributions and quantitatively predict the variations of the gas and tar evolution rates and yields with heating rate for the calibration set of experiments. The model can be improved by more precise information on lignin structure, crosslinking chemistry, and tar transport mechanisms. It also needs to be validated by simulation of pyrolysis conditions at high heating rates and/or high pressures for which data is currently not available.
