You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Measurement and modeling of lignin pyrolysis Pyrolysis of lignin is one approach that has been investigated to upgrade this material into higher value products. However, there have been relatively few efforts to quantitatively model these reactions. This paper describes a methodology for modeling lignin pyrolysis which has been extensively developed for related materials like coal. The samples are characterized using pyrolysis experiments under a standard set of conditions, where the products are analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy and Field Ionization Mass Spectrometry (FIMS). Solvent extraction experiments are done to determine the extractables yields and elemental analysis is done to further constrain the model. One lignin, produced from ethanol/water extraction of mixed hardwoods, was selected for the application of this modeling approach. The model was able to qualitatively predict the tar molecular weight distributions and quantitatively predict the variations of the gas and tar evolution rates and yields with heating rate for the calibration set of experiments. The model can be improved by more precise information on lignin structure, crosslinking chemistry, and tar transport mechanisms. It also needs to be validated by simulation of pyrolysis conditions at high heating rates and/or high pressures for which data is currently not available.
