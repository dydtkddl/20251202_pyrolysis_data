Advances in detection and sustainable risk reduction of synergistic heavy metal-microplastic co-pollution The coexistence of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in environmental systems is a complex and growing pollution problem. MPs influence the mobility, bioavailability, and persistence of metals in soil and water environments, in addition to acting as carriers of toxic metals through surface adsorption and complexation. This synergy poses long-term hazards to ecosystem health and human safety by increasing ecological risks, disrupting microbial and enzymatic processes, and enabling contaminant transfer through food webs. This review examines the combined behavior of MPs and HMs in freshwater systems and agricultural ecosystems by analyzing their mechanistic interactions. This highlights the movement and transport of HM–MP complexes, their potential for transfer through food chains, and human exposure via ingestion. Although FTIR, Raman-in-SEM, ICP-MS, SERS, and synchrotron XRF improve the identification of metal-laden MPs, the reliable analysis of nanoplastics continues to present considerable challenges. This study explores innovative bioremediation methods, focusing on microbial consortia, biofilms, and enzyme-based systems that can break down plastics and detoxify metals. Engineered enzymes embedded in metal-organic frameworks, such as PETase, Cut190, and HiC, demonstrate enhanced catalytic efficiency and operational stability. Combining these tools offers a practical approach for mitigating the hazards associated with HM–MP co-pollution. Supporting international environmental goals, the review advocates for circular, bio-based interventions and standardized detection procedures to promote sustainable pollution management.
