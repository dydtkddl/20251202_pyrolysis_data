You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in detection and sustainable risk reduction of synergistic heavy metal-microplastic co-pollution The coexistence of microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in environmental systems is a complex and growing pollution problem. MPs influence the mobility, bioavailability, and persistence of metals in soil and water environments, in addition to acting as carriers of toxic metals through surface adsorption and complexation. This synergy poses long-term hazards to ecosystem health and human safety by increasing ecological risks, disrupting microbial and enzymatic processes, and enabling contaminant transfer through food webs. This review examines the combined behavior of MPs and HMs in freshwater systems and agricultural ecosystems by analyzing their mechanistic interactions. This highlights the movement and transport of HM–MP complexes, their potential for transfer through food chains, and human exposure via ingestion. Although FTIR, Raman-in-SEM, ICP-MS, SERS, and synchrotron XRF improve the identification of metal-laden MPs, the reliable analysis of nanoplastics continues to present considerable challenges. This study explores innovative bioremediation methods, focusing on microbial consortia, biofilms, and enzyme-based systems that can break down plastics and detoxify metals. Engineered enzymes embedded in metal-organic frameworks, such as PETase, Cut190, and HiC, demonstrate enhanced catalytic efficiency and operational stability. Combining these tools offers a practical approach for mitigating the hazards associated with HM–MP co-pollution. Supporting international environmental goals, the review advocates for circular, bio-based interventions and standardized detection procedures to promote sustainable pollution management.
