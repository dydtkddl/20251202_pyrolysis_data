Zeolites mesoporosity evaluation using the cracking of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene; a critical assessment The standard faujasite Y series of Zeolyst International was tested in the catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-Triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) in a continuous-flow fixed-bed catalytic reactor. Textural properties, true density, XRD, TEM, ammonia TPD, and Brønsted acidity by the isopropylamine decomposition reaction were used to characterize the zeolites. TIPB conversion responds to the acidity available to the molecule rather than only mesoporosity. Deactivation behavior gives valuable information about accessibility. Criteria like the initial conversion or at another time are not enough for correctly ranking the catalysts; neither is the selectivity to benzene. TOF and TON are better criteria for classifying the catalysts than selectivity to a specific product like di-isomers. Zeolite CBV780 shows the highest TOF of the series, but zeolite CBV720 gives the highest TON. A good balance between acidity and mesoporosity provides the catalyst with increased activity in the TIPB cracking reaction.
