You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State of art review on conventional and advanced pyrolysis of macroalgae and microalgae for biochar, bio-oil and bio-syngas production Algal biomass including macroalgae and microalgae show great potential as pyrolysis feedstock in generating energy-dense and valuable pyrolytic products such as bio-oil, biochar and bio-syngas. The chemical constituents of macroalgae and microalgae show great variations, especially their lipid, carbohydrate and protein contents, which could affect the qualities of the pyrolytic products. From the established conventional pyrolysis, the products produced from both macroalgae and microalgae show moderate energy contents (<34 MJ/kg). The review identifies the issues associated with development of conventional pyrolysis such as flash and intermediate pyrolysis. To enhance the production of biofuels from algal biomass, advanced or non-conventional pyrolysis techniques have been employed. Catalytic pyrolysis on algal biomass could reduce the nitrogenates and oxygenates in the biofuels. On top of that, co-pyrolysis with suitable feedstock shows great enhancement on the bio-oil yield. As for hydropyrolysis of algal biomass, their generated biofuels can produce up to 48 MJ/kg with high yield of bio-oil up to 50 wt%, comparable to conventional fuels. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of algal biomass greatly shortens the processing time through advanced heating; however, favours the formation of bio-syngas by improving the yield up to 84 wt% depending on the feedstock used. Therefore, formation of biofuel fraction suitable for energy generation highly depends on the selected pyrolysis technologies.
