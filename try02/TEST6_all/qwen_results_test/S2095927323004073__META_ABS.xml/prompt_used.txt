You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation of plastic wastes to commercial chemicals and monomers under visible light Plastics are playing an incrementally extensive and irreplaceable role in human life, but with alarming cyclic unsustainability. Numerous attempts have been undertaken to recycle plastics, among which chemical recycling from waste plastics back to chemicals and monomers has attracted great attention. Herein, the depolymerization of nine types of plastics to commercial chemicals and monomers was achieved under ambient conditions via synergetic integrated uranyl-photocatalysis, which contains a process for converting five kinds of mixed plastics into a value-added product. The degradation processes were depicted in terms of variation in scanning electron microscopy imaging, distinction in the X-ray diffraction pattern, alteration in water contact angle, and dynamic in molecular weight distribution. Single electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and oxygen atom transfer were synergistically involved in uranyl-photocatalysis, which were substantiated by mechanistic studies. Relying on flow system design, the chemical recycling of plastics was feasible for kilogram-scale degradation of post-consumer-waste polyethylene terephthalate bottles to commercial chemicals, displaying a promising practical application potential in the future.
