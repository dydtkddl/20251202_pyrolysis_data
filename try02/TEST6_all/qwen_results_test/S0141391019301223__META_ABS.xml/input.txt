Evaluation of biodegradability of disposable product prepared from poly (lactic acid) under accelerated conditions Herein, biodegradability under composting and specific microbial medium was evaluated for PLA based disposable cutlery prepared as per industrial standards. Response to accelerated weathering conditions and storage capability in normal temperature also were tested. The cutleries exposed to vermi-compost as per ASTM D 5988 and the biodegradation was evaluated through regular estimation of CO2 formation, pH and TGA analysis. The biocomposite cutleries were reported an optimum of degradation within a time period of 55–60 days, which is 35% better rate than virgin polymer. SEM imaging of biodegraded sample was employed to confirm the accelerated biodegradation of biocomposite cutleries. Additionally, biodegradation using specific microbial media of Berkholderia Cepacia (B. Cepacia) and mixed fungal inoculums also conducted for cutlery formulation and compared with virgin PLA. The specific microbes consumed the biocomposites less than 30 days under controlled conditions. Accelerated weathering study in comparison with storage in normal condition was suggested the suitability of the product as an industrial applicable one.
