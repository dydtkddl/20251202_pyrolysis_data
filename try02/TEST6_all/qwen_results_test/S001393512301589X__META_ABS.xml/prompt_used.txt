You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of an electrochemical sensor utilizing graphene-like biochar for the detection of tetracycline Tetracycline (TC), which is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, can cause ecological imbalance and adversely affect human health. Therefore, a quick, inexpensive, and easy method for the detection of TC in water systems is highly desirable. This study reports the development of a novel electrochemical sensor from waste peanut shell for the quick detection of TC in water. Raman and TEM lattice mapping analyses confirmed the successful preparation of graphene -like biochar from waste peanut shells (PSs) via hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes. An electrochemical sensor, PS@glassy carbon electrode (PS@GCE), was then developed by coating the prepared graphene-like biochar on the surface of a glass electrode to enhance its conductivity. The feasibility of using this sensor for the detection of TC in the aqueous system was investigated. The PS@GCE sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity with a low detection limit of 3.6 × 10-−9 nM and a linear range of 10−10–102 μM. These results were attributed to the large specific surface area and high conductivity, of the PS biochar. The stability of the PS@GCE sensor was also investigated in the presence of TC (10−4 M) and interfering species (10−2 M) and recovery rates in the range of 86.4%–116.0% were achieved, thus indicating the absence of an interference range of range of 84.3%–98.2% with relative standard deviation lower than 6% were achieved upon the detection of TC in natural water samples using the designed sensor, thus confirming the superior repeatability of the PS@GCE sensor. Consequently, the designed electrode has a high potential for application in the detection of TC in natural aqueous systems.
