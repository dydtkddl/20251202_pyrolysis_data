You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fe/Co-Layered hydroxide-derived mixed metal oxides for efficient conversion of polystyrene to sustainable aviation fuel substitute components under CO2 mediation The use of plastic catalytic pyrolysis technology for producing aviation fuel substitute components holds broad application prospects in mitigating fossil resource depletion and environmental pollution. In this work, Fe/Co-layered hydroxide-derived mixed metal oxides (CoAl-LDO and FeCoAl-LDO) were prepared and used to catalyze the conversion of polystyrene into aviation fuel substitute components with rich-monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Compared with the CoAl-LDO, FeCoAl-LDO catalyst showed excellent catalytic conversion performance. Especially, the relative content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the liquid product reached 63.76% under CO2 mediation, which had an increase of 9.94% compared to the N2. The increase of FeCoAl-LDO mass ratio significantly promoted the generation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which reaches its maximum value of 73.32%. In terms of liquid components, the carbon number of aromatic components primarily falls within C7-C12, aligning with the usage range for aviation fuel substitute components. And, the proportion of light aromatic hydrocarbons reached 71.58%. This research highlights the promise of the FeCoAl-LDO catalyst in the production of aviation fuel substitute components under CO2 mediation, thereby providing vital support for the development of sustainable aviation fuel.
