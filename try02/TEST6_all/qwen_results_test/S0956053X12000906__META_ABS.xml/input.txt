Sludge as dioxins suppressant in hospital waste incineration Nitrogen containing compounds such as ammonia, urea and amines can effectively inhibit the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Sewage sludge accumulates both sulfur and nitrogen during wastewater treatment so it could be used to reduce PCDD/Fs formation. Indeed, it is observed in this study that the gas evolving from the sludge drying process can significantly suppress chlorobenzene (CBz) and PCDD/Fs formation from fly ash collected from a hospital waste incinerator. For instance, the reduction of hexachlorobenzene (HxCBz) and PCDD/Fs amount was 92.1% and 78.7%, respectively, when the drying gas evolving from 2g sludge flew through 2g fly ash. These tests were conducted in the frame of projects devoted to hospital waste incineration. The disposal technology for hospital waste (HW), developed in this institute, features rotary kiln pyrolysis combined with post-combustion followed by flue gas cleaning. Hence, some preliminary tests were devoted to investigate dioxins suppression by co-pyrolysis and co-combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and sludge in lab scale. More experimental research will be conducted to appropriately assess these effects of sludge on PCDD/Fs emissions during co-pyrolysis/combustion of HW and sludge.
