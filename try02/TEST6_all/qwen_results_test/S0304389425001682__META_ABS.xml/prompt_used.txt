You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing FeS crystallinity of sulfidated nZVI to enhance electron transport capacity for clothianidin efficient degradation: Regulation of biochar pyrolysis temperature Clothianidin (CTD), a highly water soluble neonicotinoid insecticide, easily enters water through runoff. Developing eco-friendly materials to degrade CTD is essential. Nano zero valent iron (nZVI) is effective for contaminant removal, but it deactivates due to agglomeration. Biochar supported sulfidated nano zero valent iron (S-nZVI-BC) can effectively mitigate nZVI aggregation while enhancing anti-passivation and electron transfer. However, the regulation of BC preparation conditions on S-nZVI-BC performance and contaminant degradation mechanism remains elusive. This work systematically investigated the effects of BC pyrolysis temperature on FeS formation in S-nZVI-BC and CTD degradation mechanism. BC enhanced FeS crystallinity and increased Fe0 lattice constants, facilitating electron transfer. Compared to S-ZVI, the CTD removal kinetics constants of S-nZVI-BC was 2.30 folds higher. Competitive dynamics model revealed BC pyrolysis temperature and S modulated the competition between O2 and CTD, enhancing electron utilization efficiency and improving nZVI anti-passivation under oxic conditions. Quenching experiment and electrochemical tests indicated S incorporation and changes in BC pyrolysis temperature modulated nZVI active reduced species (H*) production and contribution to CTD degradation. Additionally, increasing FeS crystallinity by adjusting BC pyrolysis temperature improved the electron transfer efficiency of S-nZVI-BC, enabling efficient CTD degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed CTD preferentially underwent nitro-reduction over dechlorination. All these findings can provide guidance for the application of S-nZVI-BC.
