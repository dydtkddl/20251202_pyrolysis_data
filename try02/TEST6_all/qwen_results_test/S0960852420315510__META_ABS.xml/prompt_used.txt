You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of renewable aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon resources from microwave pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis of agro-residues and plastics wastes The present study focussed on recovering the valuable carbon resources from agro-residues (wheat straw, rice husk) and waste plastics (polypropylene, polystyrene) using microwave pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the susceptor blending mechanism on the co-pyrolysis product distribution. Graphite was mixed with feedstock in a new approach to achieving homogeneity, and microwave power of 600 W was used. The average heating rate (52–67 (°C/min)), microwave energy required (2267–2936 (J/g)), heat energy utilized (1410–1444 (J/g)), and conductive heat losses (85–110 (J/g)) were analyzed. The selectivity of cyclic alkanes and alkenes (65.5%) was found to be high in polypropylene pyrolysis oil. Polystyrene pyrolysis oil predominantly contained cyclooctatetraene (61%) compound. Bio-oil obtained from wheat straw predominantly contained aromatic hydrocarbons (85%), whereas rice husk oil also contains high selectivity aromatic hydrocarbons (37.8%) along with aliphatic hydrocarbons (54.9%). The co-pyrolysis oils has high selectivity of aromatics.
