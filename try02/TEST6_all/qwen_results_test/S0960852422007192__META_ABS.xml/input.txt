Understanding the management of household food waste and its engineering for sustainable valorization- A state-of-the-art review Increased urbanization and industrialization accelerated demand for energy, large-scale waste output, and negative environmental consequences. Therefore, the implementation of an effective solid-waste-management (SWM) policy for the handling of food waste is of great importance. The global food waste generation is estimated at about 1.6 gigatons/yr which attributes to an economic revenue of 750 billion USD. It can be converted into high-value enzymes, surfactants, Poly-hydroxybutyrate, biofuels, etc. However, the heterogeneous composition of food with high organic load and varying moisture content makes their transformation into value-added products difficult. This review aims to bring forth the possibilities and repercussions of food waste management. The socio-economic challenges related to SWM are comprehensively discussed particularly in terms of environmental concern. The engineering aspect in the collection, storage, and biotransformation of food waste into useful value-added products such as biofuels, advanced biomaterials, bioactive compounds, and platform chemicals are critically reviewed for efficient food waste management.
