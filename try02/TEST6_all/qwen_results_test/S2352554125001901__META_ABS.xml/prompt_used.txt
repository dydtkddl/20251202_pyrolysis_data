You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailored biopolymer and its nanocomposites along with EPR frameworks under circular economy: A dual strategy for sustainable packaging solutions The widespread use of synthetic plastics in packaging while offering affordability and durability has led to severe environmental consequences, including persistent waste and rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This review critically examines bioplastics as a sustainable packaging alternative, integrating bibliometric mapping (VOSviewer), systematic literature analysis, and techno-economic assessments (TEA) to provide a data-driven overview. Key findings indicate that life cycle assessments (LCA) of PLA- and PHB-based materials report up to a 40 % reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional LDPE. These materials have achieved technology readiness levels (TRL) of 6–7 in various pilot-scale packaging applications, reflecting their progress toward commercialization. Chemical modifications and Nanotechnology-enabled reinforcement strategies have shown promising improvements in barrier properties and mechanical strength, addressing major commercialization barriers. The study also explores the policy landscape, noting that Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks and circular economy regulations are gaining traction in regions such as the EU and India. Despite technological advancements, challenges such as high production costs, limited consumer awareness, and underdeveloped waste segregation systems persist. This review emphasizes the importance of aligning scientific progress with policy incentives and public outreach to increase market adoption. A strategic call-to-action is made for increased investment in scalable technologies, harmonized regulatory frameworks, and targeted R&D to accelerate the transition towards a circular, bioplastic-driven economy. The findings provide a comprehensive roadmap for stakeholders to advance sustainable packaging solutions in both academic and industrial domains.
