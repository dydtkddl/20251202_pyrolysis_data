Tailored biopolymer and its nanocomposites along with EPR frameworks under circular economy: A dual strategy for sustainable packaging solutions The widespread use of synthetic plastics in packaging while offering affordability and durability has led to severe environmental consequences, including persistent waste and rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This review critically examines bioplastics as a sustainable packaging alternative, integrating bibliometric mapping (VOSviewer), systematic literature analysis, and techno-economic assessments (TEA) to provide a data-driven overview. Key findings indicate that life cycle assessments (LCA) of PLA- and PHB-based materials report up to a 40 % reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional LDPE. These materials have achieved technology readiness levels (TRL) of 6–7 in various pilot-scale packaging applications, reflecting their progress toward commercialization. Chemical modifications and Nanotechnology-enabled reinforcement strategies have shown promising improvements in barrier properties and mechanical strength, addressing major commercialization barriers. The study also explores the policy landscape, noting that Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks and circular economy regulations are gaining traction in regions such as the EU and India. Despite technological advancements, challenges such as high production costs, limited consumer awareness, and underdeveloped waste segregation systems persist. This review emphasizes the importance of aligning scientific progress with policy incentives and public outreach to increase market adoption. A strategic call-to-action is made for increased investment in scalable technologies, harmonized regulatory frameworks, and targeted R&D to accelerate the transition towards a circular, bioplastic-driven economy. The findings provide a comprehensive roadmap for stakeholders to advance sustainable packaging solutions in both academic and industrial domains.
