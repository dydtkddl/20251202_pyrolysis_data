You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multifaceted analysis of products from the intermediate co-pyrolysis of biomass with Tetra Pak waste This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of two types of biomass (pine bark and wheat straw) with Tetra Pak waste (TPW). The experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor equipped with an innovative system, where a sample was rapidly heated to 600 °C before being rapidly cooled. The multifaceted analysis included the determination of the i) physical and chemical properties of the feedstocks and chars, ii) aqueous phase, tars, and waxes, iii) char ignition and burnout temperature, iv) chemical composition of gas, and v) distribution of carbon and hydrogen in the obtained products. The results showed that the addition of TPW to the both types of biomass significantly reduced the char mass and aqueous phase, decreased the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents of the char, and increased the wax and tar yields retained in the water cooler. Different organic compounds such as alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and acids were found in tars and waxes. The chemical composition of the released gases was detected in situ (by a flue-gas analyser) and ex-situ (using gas chromatography). Changes in the concentrations of H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and C2–C4 were observed. The addition of Tetra Pak to the two types of biomass had an evident and positive effect on the hydrogen content of the pyrolysis gas.
