You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on the intra-particle anisotropic transport properties of a beech wood particle during pyrolysis In the present study, the influence of the dynamic and anistropic pore microstructure of wood and char samples on the intra-particle flow permeability and tortuosity was investigated. To this end, a beech wood sphere was pyrolysed at different temperatures (100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C) and characterised, after each pyrolysis step, by X-ray micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). From the μ-CT images, the structural geometry of the particle at the different conversion degrees achieved at each temperature level was extracted. The porosity evolution was characterised, accounting for pores larger than 15 μm, which was the limit of resolution for μ-CT imaging in this study. The structural geometry was divided in subdomains and used for CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations, where the pressure loss at different velocities and in different directions with respect to the main pores (vessel cells) was determined and used to estimate the dynamic and anisotropic permeabilities. The permeability differed by an order of magnitude in the direction of the main pores (vessel cells) in comparison to the perpendicular directions, supporting the need to develop permeability tensors for improved simulations of the pyrolysis process at particle level, accounting for the coupled effects of microstructure, transport, and reaction.
