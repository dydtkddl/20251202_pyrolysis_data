You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress in the preparation of high-quality liquid fuels and chemicals by catalytic pyrolysis of biomass: A review Considering the pressures of energy and the environment, using renewable resource—biomass to obtain hydrocarbon fuels and high-value chemicals has important application value and broad market prospects. However, due to the complex pyrolysis process of biomass, low calorific value, high oxygen content and strong acidity of bio-oil, the application of bio-oil as liquid fuel and chemicals are restricted. It is urgent to improve the quality of bio-oil. In this paper, the effects of biomass raw materials, pretreatment methods, co-pyrolysis of hydrogen donors and pyrolysis reaction conditions on the preparation of bio-oil by fast pyrolysis of biomass are described in detail. The article further discusses the research progress of biomass pyrolysis to prepare liquid fuel and high-value chemicals, including direct catalytic pyrolysis of biomass to prepare high-quality bio-oil, fast pyrolysis to prepare bio-oil and then catalytic upgrading, pyrolysis to prepare ketone and furan platform compounds, and then aldol condensation and catalytic hydrogenation. The main achievements and problems of three different synthesis techniques are reviewed objectively. Finally, the catalytic characteristics of catalysts are introduced by classification, and the specific applications and reaction mechanisms of different catalysts in catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic cracking and catalytic hydrogenation are systematically summarized, which provides a new direction for the research of lignocellulose biomass energy utilization.
