You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The hydrogen storage capacity of carbon nano-onions fabricated by thermal chemical vapour deposition Hydrogen is a promising energy source for resolving the world's energy demands without releasing pollution, but storing hydrogen poses a significant challenge. Carbon materials such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon nanofibers (CNF), carbon nano-onions (CNOs) and graphene are potential substrate materials for hydrogen storage through physisorption/chemisorption due to their large surface areas and the ability to bind hydrogen. We investigate the hydrogen storage capacity of CNOs synthesized through thermal chemical vapour deposition using acetylene in this paper. SEM and XRD analysis revealed that the CNOs are spherical and comprised 18 shells at 850 °C and 7 shells at 1000 °C. However, the CNO interlayer thickness increased from 3.42 to 3.58 A0, which has a significant impact on the physisorption process. Functionalized CNOs were studied for their hydrogen storage capacities at 77 K and 1.5 atm, demonstrated a hydrogen storage capacity of 18.2%. The BET measurements revealed that the CNOs samples have a surface area of 642 m2/gm and FTIR showed a significant increase in –OH and –CH bond vibrations. Desorption studies of hydrogen reveal primarily two stages. The removal of hydrogen from CNO requires a first-stage activation energy of 6 kJ/mol and a second-stage activation energy of 127 kJ/mol, confirming the presence of both physiosorbed and chemisorbed hydrogen. This study found that hydrogen storage capacity of CNOs is extremely promising, and has a potential for mobile applications.
