You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming of polystyrene through a two-step reaction system Hydrogen production from polystyrene (PS) has been studied following continuous pyrolysis and in-line steam reforming. The first step was carried out at 500°C in a conical spouted bed reactor and the subsequent reforming one was performed in a fluidized bed reactor on a commercial Ni catalyst at 700°C. The effect space time and time on stream have on the reaction indexes (reforming conversion, yields of H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons, and H2 production) has been determined. Furthermore, the process performance has been compared with the results obtained in a previous study conducted by feeding HDPE under the same conditions. Full reforming of PS derived volatiles and high H2 production of 29.1 wt% were attained at zero time on stream. However, a significantly poorer performance of the catalyst was observed after 100min continuous operation, with the decrease in activity being more acute than that observed for HDPE in a previous study. This deactivating behaviour has been related to the aromatic nature of PS thermal degradation products. The cokes deposited in the degradation of PS and HDPE have been analysed by means of temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and electron microscopy, and the higher deactivation rate observed in the case of PS has been related to the condensed and encapsulating nature of the coke formed from aromatic hydrocarbons.
