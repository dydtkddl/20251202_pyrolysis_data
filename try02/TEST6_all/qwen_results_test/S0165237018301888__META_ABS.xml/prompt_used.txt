You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization and pyrolysis behavior of the green microalga Micractinium conductrix grown in lab-scale tubular photobioreactor using Py-GC/MS and TGA/MS Nowadays, microalgae are widely discussed as a promising feedstock for biofuel production. For higher crude bio-oil yield with good quality, microalgal biomass productivity and bio-oil characteristics are essential parameters. However, the same microalgal species has different chemical compositions at different growth phases. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the best growth phase for high biomass productivity and optimal bio-oil production from the green microalga Micractinium conductrix via Py-GC/MS and TGA/MS analysis. M. conductrix was grown in a tubular photobioreactor and harvested at early exponential phase (EEP), middle exponential phase (MEP), late exponential phase (LEP) and stationary phase (STP). LEP showed the maximum significant (P ≤ 0.05) biomass productivity of 0.058 ± 0.004 g L−1 d-1, with maximum significant lipid and carbohydrate contents (28.7 ± 1.1 and 42.9 ± 1.2%dw, respectively). TGA/MS results confirmed that biomass harvested at MEP and LEP showed higher extent of conversion or mass loss reaction via thermal degradation with the lowest residual solid products. In addition, the hydrocarbon fragments in gaseous products (H2, C2H6, CH4, C2H4) from TGA/MS analysis were found to be released more abundantly at LEP. Moreover, Py-GC/MS results revealed that thermal decomposition of biomass harvested at LEP resulted in the highest significant relative contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons (41.2%) with lowest nitrogen-containing compounds (6.3%). The present study showed the significant impact of harvest time of microalgae on products characteristics of thermal decomposition and nominated LEP as the optimum growth phase to harvest M. conductrix for upgraded bio-oil production.
