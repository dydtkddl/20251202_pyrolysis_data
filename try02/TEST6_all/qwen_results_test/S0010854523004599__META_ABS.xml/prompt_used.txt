You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis, thermoelectric and energy storage performance of transition metal oxides composites Due to their intriguing electronic properties and structural composition, transition metal oxides (TMOs) such as AOx, AxOx, and A x B3- x Ox; A, B = Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, W, etc., and their designed composites have tremendous potential in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors (SCs) and metal ion batteries (MIBs). Some outstanding properties of TMOs and their composites for applications as electrode materials in energy storage devices include their high conductivity, charge storage characteristics, doping potential, and composite forming propensity. The significant interactions of TMOs with heteroatoms, conductive polymers, and carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) drastically change the reactive parameters and electrical characteristics. This review covers the most recent advances in TMO research and development, ranging from mechanism design to device performance, with a main focus on essentials such as design, synthesis, manufacturing, and energy-storing properties. The electrochemical pyrolysis, in-situ preparation, solvothermal/hydrothermal approach, and other critical approaches and their implications are also discussed. The synergetic improvement of designed TMO/graphene, TMO/rGO, TMO/heteroatoms, TMO/polymers, TMO/halide/hydride, TMO/Chalcogens through ionic interactions, and investigation of the electrode–electrolyte interfaces have been discussed in detail. In addition, the effect of electrolytes, surface behavior, and performance evaluation parameters on the SC device performance have been included. Furthermore, parameters and models, reliability design and profile lifetime, common mistakes in performance evaluation of SC, and other obstacles and mitigation have been described in depth. Altogether, a well-grasped overview and potential strategies extended from the overall analysis of electrode materials and electrolytes are offered to lift advancement in developing futuristic materials for energy storage applications.
