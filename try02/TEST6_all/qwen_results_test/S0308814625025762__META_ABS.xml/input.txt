Safety and recyclability of active polyethylene terephthalate bottles: A comprehensive assessment using non-target screening and visual sensory evaluation To enhance the oxygen barrier properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging, oxygen scavengers (OS) are applied to introduce active oxygen-scavenging functionalities. However, OS-related food safety risks and their impact on PET recyclability have received insufficient attention. Here, we systematically assessed safety risks by analyzing the migration of volatile, semi-volatile, non-volatile substances, and inorganic elements from various PET bottles. Six substances (eicosane, heneicosane, 3-tert-butylbenzoic acid, azulene, dimethyl phthalate, and 2-ethoxytetrahydrofuran) showed the possibility to exceed their Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) or reference limits, indicating potential risks. Notably, 2-ethoxytetrahydrofuran was strongly linked to OS. Additionally, the effects of OS on the color of recycled PET were examined, revealing significant color shifts (particularly reductions in L* values and increases in b* values) with higher proportions of recycled resin. Outdoor exposure worsened visual changes, further hindering recycling. Future research should focus on optimizing OS benefits while minimizing risks to ensure safety and recyclability.
