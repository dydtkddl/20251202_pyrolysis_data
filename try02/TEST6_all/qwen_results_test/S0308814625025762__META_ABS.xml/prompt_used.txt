You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Safety and recyclability of active polyethylene terephthalate bottles: A comprehensive assessment using non-target screening and visual sensory evaluation To enhance the oxygen barrier properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging, oxygen scavengers (OS) are applied to introduce active oxygen-scavenging functionalities. However, OS-related food safety risks and their impact on PET recyclability have received insufficient attention. Here, we systematically assessed safety risks by analyzing the migration of volatile, semi-volatile, non-volatile substances, and inorganic elements from various PET bottles. Six substances (eicosane, heneicosane, 3-tert-butylbenzoic acid, azulene, dimethyl phthalate, and 2-ethoxytetrahydrofuran) showed the possibility to exceed their Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) or reference limits, indicating potential risks. Notably, 2-ethoxytetrahydrofuran was strongly linked to OS. Additionally, the effects of OS on the color of recycled PET were examined, revealing significant color shifts (particularly reductions in L* values and increases in b* values) with higher proportions of recycled resin. Outdoor exposure worsened visual changes, further hindering recycling. Future research should focus on optimizing OS benefits while minimizing risks to ensure safety and recyclability.
