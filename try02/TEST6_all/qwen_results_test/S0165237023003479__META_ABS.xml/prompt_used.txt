You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of EPET, EPEI, and EPU pyrolysis characteristics: Thermal decomposition behaviours, pyrolysis products and mechanism Pyrolysis is a promising technology in recycling copper from enamelled wires. Nevertheless, due to the unclear pyrolysis characteristics, the sorting of enamelled wires is deficient in the pyrolysis process. This work systematically investigated the pyrolysis characteristics of polyester enamelled wire (EPET), polyester imine enamelled wire (EPEI) and polyurethane enamelled wire (EPU). The decomposition behaviours showed that the mass loss for EPEI and EPET was around 1.9%, while it was about 1.5% for EPU. The pyrolysis temperature intervals and peaks for both EPEI and EPET appeared in the range of 320 ∼ 500 ℃ and around 420 ℃, while it was in a larger range of 228 ∼ 657 ℃ for EPU, and the peak was about 280 ℃. The average activation energies (E) calculated with Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) model demonstrated that EPEI and EPET were respectively 275.8 kJ/mol and 296.9 kJ/mol, while it was 194.2 kJ/mol for EPU. TG-FTIR results proved that the -CH, -CO, -CH2, and -OH were the main functional groups in the pyrolysis process for the three enamelled wires. Moreover, Py-GC/MS results indicated that the main pyrolysis product was benzoic acid for EPET and EPEI, while it was not observed for EPU. The pyrolysis mechanism displayed that the kinds of pyrolysis products were directly related to the connected aromatic functional group. The complicated pyrolysis products for EPU were mainly caused by the generation of isocyanate. Accordingly, EPU could be separately pyrolyzed, while EPET and EPEI were suitable for co-pyrolyzed. In consideration of improving pyrolysis efficiency and reducing energy consumption, the classification treatment by this method could be extended.
