You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of N behavior during coal pyrolysis and oxidation using ReaxFF molecular dynamics This paper presents ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of pyrolysis and oxidation processes at 500–2500 K and 1000–2800 K performed using the GPU-enabled ReaxFF MD code of GMD-Reax and reaction analysis code of VARxMD. The simulation results of a large-scale coal model with varied types of N-containing groups shows that more than 65% N still remains in C40+ fragments and about 25% N migrates into C5–C40 fragments after pyrolysis stage. The evolution tendencies of light gases (NH3, HCN, HNCO, NO, N2 and NO2) and important radicals (CN, NH2/NH, NCO and HNO) with temperature were observed from the slow heat-up coal oxidation simulation at fuel lean condition. The detailed structures and conversion reactions associated with light nitrogen species were obtained. The NCO-containing intermediates are found playing a significant role for NO emission that more than 50% of the NO formation is through NCO-containing intermediates, some of which comes from the oxidation of CN radicals and HNCO. The hydrogen abstraction of N–H in pyrrole groups by O2 will create an initial unstable environment, followed with O insertion reactions into N-containing heterocyclic ring structures to promote the activation of N-containing groups in coal structure.
