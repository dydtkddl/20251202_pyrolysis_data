You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of machine learning algorithms in estimation of syngas fractions and exergy values for gasification of biomass-lignite mixtures in fixed and fluidized bed gasifiers Earth’s environmental challenges, such as climate change and pollution, require urgent emission reductions. A thermochemical method that transforms carbon-rich substances into syngas, biomass gasification produces clean hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier. This process ensures high carbon conversion efficiency while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the gasification of nine biomass-lignite blends using fluidized-bed and fixed-bed gasifiers. A wide range of biomass samples blended with lignite enabled the analysis of different sample characteristics and their impact on the gasification technique. ASPEN Plus® simulations assess the effects of biomass-to-lignite ratio, equivalence ratio (ER), steam to biomass ratio (SBR), and reactor temperature on syngas fraction and system efficiency. Machine learning models gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT) predict syngas and product gas exergy values, providing a data-driven optimization approach. For hazelnut shell validation, R2 values were 0.98 for the fixed-bed model and 0.96 for the fluidized-bed model. The Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.93), outperforming other models. The study also analysed the amount of data required and demonstrated robust models capable of learning with limited data. Since a significant portion of the machine learning process involves dataset creation, the ability to learn from small datasets is crucial. This highlights the significance of data-efficient learning in machine learning applications. Findings contribute to advancing biomass gasification for cleaner hydrogen production.
