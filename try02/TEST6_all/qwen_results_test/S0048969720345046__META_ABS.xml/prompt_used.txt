You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review of the overlooked challenge of determining micro-bioplastics in soil Currently, non-biodegradable oil-based plastics are gradually being replaced by bio-based biodegradable plastics to prevent the formation of microplastics. For biodegradable materials to decompose completely, however, they require specific conditions that are rarely met in ecosystems. Paradoxically, this may lead to the fast production of microplastics from biodegradable materials, i.e. micro-bioplastics. Until recently, the scientific focus has been solely on the estimation of conventional microplastics. As a result, there is a lack of analytical methods for determining the amount of micro-bioplastics in soil. In this review, we address this problem by summarising sample pre-treatments and analytical techniques suitable for the determination of conventional microplastics, which serve as inspiration for the determination of micro-bioplastics from polyhydroxybutyrates, polylactic acid and polybutylene adipate terephthalate in soil. The analytical techniques include both pyrolysis-based techniques, i.e. thermoanalytical and non-thermoanalytical approaches including sample pre-separation and respective detection limits. We conclude that due to the incomplete knowledge of the production rate of micro-bioplastics, fate, sorption properties and toxicity, it is necessary to develop and validate a rapid and suitable method for their determination. Indeed, the use of thermoanalytical approaches seems to be the most promising strategy. Furthermore, we suggest how the development and analysis of micro-bioplastics should be addressed in future research.
