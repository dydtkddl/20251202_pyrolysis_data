You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxygen functionalized porous activated biocarbons with high surface area derived from grape marc for enhanced capture of CO2 at elevated-pressure This research demonstrates the conversion of grape marc into highly carbonaceous and oxygen functionalized porous activated biocarbons (PABs) with a high specific area for CO2 capture. The materials are synthesized using KOH activation at 800 °C and show a high content of micropores and high specific surface areas which can be easily manipulated by varying the amount of KOH. The optimized material PAB3 obtained using KOH/grape marc biochar ratio of 3 displays the highest specific surface area (2473 m2 g−1), high micropore volume (0.72 cm3 g−1) and a pore diameter of 0.74 nm. Owing to its highly developed porosity and excellent textural parameters, PAB3 exhibits a high CO2 adsorption of 6.2 mmol g−1 at 0 °C/1 bar and 26.8 mmol g−1 at 0 °C/30 bar. It is often considered challenging to synthesize a CO2 adsorbent with all-round performance for CO2 capture under diverse conditions of temperature and pressure. The optimized material PAB3 is also found to be thermally stable which when coupled with its superior CO2 capture performance presents a promising candidature in the field of carbon capture. Furthermore, the excellent features of the synthesized material suggest that these materials could be extended to several other adsorption related fields.
