You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of biodegradable plastic in CO2 atmosphere using MSW incinerator bottom ash for PLA monomer recovery This study proposes a method for recovering value-added monomers from abandoned biodegradable plastics such as used biodegradable straws (UBSs) by utilizing a catalyst made of bottom ash generated from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators. The MSW-derived bottom ash (MSW-BA) catalyst primarily comprises alkaline metal oxides such as CaO (58.88 wt%). Thermogravimetric and single-shot pyrolysis analyses show that polylactic acid (PLA) monomers—lactide and lactic acid—are the main products of UBS pyrolysis. We conducted catalytic pyrolysis of UBS at 500 °C under different atmospheres (N2 and CO2), with and without the MSW-BA catalyst. Compared with non-catalytic pyrolysis, the MSW-BA catalyst-based pyrolysis significantly increased the yield of PLA monomers in both N2 and CO2 environments. This is because the base sites present on the MSW-BA catalyst promoted the polymeric bond cleavage of PLA. The MSW-BA catalyst in CO2 achieved the highest recovery yield of PLA monomers (20.84 wt% per feedstock mass basis), which was approximately 17.75 % higher than that during non-catalytic UBS pyrolysis. The base sites present on the MSW-BA catalyst promoted polymeric bond cleavage of PLA, and the base-catalyzed pyrolysis of PLA was enhanced by the more reactive cleavage of the bond linkages in the presence of CO2. The proposed approach not only reuses biodegradable plastic waste but also utilizes the MSW treatment byproducts.
