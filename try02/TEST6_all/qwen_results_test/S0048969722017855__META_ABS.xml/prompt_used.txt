You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental analysis on products distribution and characterization of medical waste pyrolysis with a focus on liquid yield quantity and quality The massive generation of medical waste (MW) poses a serious risk to the natural environment and human health. The pyrolysis technique is proposed as a potential treatment for MW to tackle the associated environmental issues and produce value-added products. In this work, medical waste pyrolysis has been conducted at various temperatures using a fixed bed reactor with a 20 °C·min−1 heating rate and nitrogen was used as a career gas with a flow rate of 100 ml·min−1. In addition, the effect of temperature on products yield and chemical composition of MW pyrolysis have been investigated. The maximum yield of 57.1% for liquid oil was observed from the mixed MW pyrolysis at 500 °C. The gas and char yield were found between 26.5–37.3% and 24.2–12.4%, respectively, for the pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C to 600 °C. According to GC analysis, the concentration of the main gaseous products such as CH4, H2, and C2H4 was increased with increasing temperature, while CO and CO2 experienced a decreasing trend. The results of GC–MS analysis revealed that the main components of MW pyrolysis oil were aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohol, carboxylic acids, and their derivatives. The aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons content increased up to 38.2% at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. As pyrolysis oil tends to have more long-chain hydrocarbons therefore carbon distributions from C7 to C35 were observed. The ultimate analysis of oil and char revealed that the increased temperature enhanced the carbon content up to 78.6% and 68.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the higher heat values of 41.8, 24.4, and 52.7 MJ·kg−1 were reported for oil, char, and gas, respectively.
