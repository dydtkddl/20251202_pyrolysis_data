You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ethylene scavenging properties from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-TiO2 and gelatin-TiO2 nanocomposites on polyethylene supports for fruit application Several technologies have been proposed to preserve fruits and to avoid postharvest losses. The degradation of ethylene produced by the fruits using TiO2 photocatalysis has shown to be a good option to delay the ripening of fruits. This paper proposed a new application of biopolymers-TiO2 nanocomposites developed to extend the shelf-life of fruits. Photocatalytic coatings were applied on the expanded polyethylene foam nets to degrade ethylene. Gelatin and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HMPC) were tested as hydrophobic and hydrophilic matrices for the TiO2 incorporation. First, nanocomposite films prepared by casting were evaluated with regards to their photocatalytic properties. Both matrices, which were loaded with 1 wt% TiO2, degraded 40% of the ethylene injected in a batch reactor. By Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, ethylene degradation using gelatin-TiO2 films (kapp = 0.186 ± 0.021 min−1) was faster than the HPMC-TiO2 films (kapp = 0.034 ± 0.003 min−1). Then, gelatin-TiO2 dispersion was applied as a coating on the foam nets by dip coating. The gelatin-TiO2 bilayer exhibited higher concentration of ethylene degraded per photocatalytic area and photocatalyst mass unit (13.297 ± 0.178 ppmv m2 g TiO 2 − 1 ) than its film form (18.212 ± 1.157 ppmv m2 g TiO 2 − 1 ), which makes gelatin-TiO2/foam nets a promising composite design for fruit postharvest application.
