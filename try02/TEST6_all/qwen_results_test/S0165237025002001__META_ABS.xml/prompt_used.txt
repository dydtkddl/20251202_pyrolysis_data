You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-conversion of biomass and petroleum vacuum residue in delayed coker unit The co-conversion of rice straw biomass and petroleum vacuum residue is studied under the conditions of a commercial delayed coker unit. Co-conversion results in an increase in coke yield and decrease in pyrolysis oil yield as compared to the petroleum vacuum residue. The reduction of the acidity (TAN) of liquid product as compared to weighted average contribution from vacuum residue and biomass cracking is observed, making it suitable for processing in a refinery. Saturate compounds including paraffins and monocycloparaffins increase with increasing biomass dosing, whereas a decrease is observed for polycyclic aromatics. The amount of oxygenates in the liquid products increases with an increase in the biomass dosing. The sulfur content of coke from biomass co-processing is lower than the coke generated from vacuum residue alone, indicating a lower SOx emission potential upon coke combustion. Metallic impurities concentrate in the coke / biochar produced during biomass co-processing, resulting in higher real density and ash content. The crystallite size of calcined coke decreases with an increase in biomass dosing but no substantial change in the graphite interlayer spacing occurs.
