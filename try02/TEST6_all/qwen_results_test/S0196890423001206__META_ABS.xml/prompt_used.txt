You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted co-gasification of mixed plastics and corn stover: A synergistic approach to produce clean hydrogen Co-gasification of waste plastic and corn stover into hydrogen is an effective way of reducing hydrogen cost and carbon footprint. However, current gasification technologies are energy intensive and cannot accommodate flexible feedstock. Microwave gasification offers several advantages including higher H2 yield and enhanced selectivity to syngas over tars. This work presents parametric optimization study of microwave co-gasification of mixed plastics and corn stover for hydrogen-rich syngas. High hydrogen yields of 30.5 mmolH2/gfeed at 700 °C were obtained using a microwave reactor, as opposed to 0.9 mmolH2/gfeed at 700–950 °C with conventional heating. Hydrogen yields are >98% of the theoretical extractable hydrogen from feedstock. Microwaves enhanced plastic and corn stover synergy and reduced tar yields. H-poor carbon formation resulting from the dehydrogenation of tar and coke, and light olefins decomposition, triggered by the external microwave electric fields, allowed further cracking of intermediate hydrocarbons to produce additional H2.
