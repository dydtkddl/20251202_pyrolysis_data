Hierarchical pore structure engineering in bamboo shoot sheath-derived biochar: Synergistic effects of bio-templated chemical activation and gradient pyrolysis The combustion of fossil fuels has led to excessive CO2 emissions and severe climate impacts, making efficient CO2 capture an urgent priority. Although chemical activation can enhance the CO2 adsorption performance of biochar, its extensive use often entails environmental, equipment, and cost challenges. In this study, we present an innovative bio-templating strategy to synthesize hierarchically porous, heteroatom-enriched biochars derived from waste bamboo shoot shells and starch, using K2CO3 as an activator and yeast as the bio-template. This method significantly reduces activator consumption compared with conventional activation processes. The optimized biochar, BAS0.5KC-800, exhibited exceptional CO2 adsorption capacities of 5.15 mmol/g at 0 ℃ and 3.38 mmol/g at 25 ℃. Structural analysis revealed that its high specific surface area (1186 m2/g) and micropore volume (0.55 cm3/g) provide abundant CO2 adsorption sites. Furthermore, the bio-templating process successfully introduced N and O heteroatoms into the carbon framework. These functional groups enhance the affinity between biochar and CO2 through electronic interactions, ensuring excellent adsorption stability over multiple adsorption–desorption cycles. Isotherm and kinetic analyses indicate that CO2 adsorption proceeds via a multilayer diffusion-controlled mechanism. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that N dopants facilitate CO2 capture through hydrogen bonding, whereas O atoms strengthen dipole–quadrupole interactions. Overall, this study presents a sustainable and cost-effective approach to produce high-performance CO2 adsorbents from waste biomass and provides comprehensive mechanistic insights into how heteroatom doping promotes CO2 capture efficiency.
