You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multifunctional TPMS-based interpenetrating phase composites: A comprehensive review of structure, properties, piezoelectricity and applications Owing to their superior electro-thermo-mechanical properties, the significance of interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) in various industries is in high demand. IPCs, characterized by infiltrating metal, ceramic, and polymer phases, provide various advantages, including a balanced mixture of strength, stiffness, and toughness, excellent thermal characteristics, wear resistance, and flexibility in microstructure and processing routes. This comprehensive review explores the realm of multifunctional reinforcing phases, specifically focusing on their integration into 3D printed composites. Within this context, the IPCs with a special spotlight on captivating world of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) and other cellular/lattice architectures wherein two core themes are presented and dissected: TPMS-based IPCs, which collaboratively amplify properties of another phase and interpenetrating piezoelectric phase composites (IP2Cs), which offer special advantages over conventional ones. We compiled comprehensive data on IPCs, emphasizing their effective properties, mechanical performance, fatigue and fracture behavior, energy absorption capacity, and coupled electromechanical characteristics. Furthermore, the commercial applications of architectured IPCs across industries are highlighted, along with a critical analysis of current research, identifying gaps and challenges. It highlights their pivotal role in advancing technology and addressing contemporary challenges while illuminating the uncharted possibilities presented by TPMS cellular structures in the dynamic landscape of 3D printing.
