Multifunctional TPMS-based interpenetrating phase composites: A comprehensive review of structure, properties, piezoelectricity and applications Owing to their superior electro-thermo-mechanical properties, the significance of interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) in various industries is in high demand. IPCs, characterized by infiltrating metal, ceramic, and polymer phases, provide various advantages, including a balanced mixture of strength, stiffness, and toughness, excellent thermal characteristics, wear resistance, and flexibility in microstructure and processing routes. This comprehensive review explores the realm of multifunctional reinforcing phases, specifically focusing on their integration into 3D printed composites. Within this context, the IPCs with a special spotlight on captivating world of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) and other cellular/lattice architectures wherein two core themes are presented and dissected: TPMS-based IPCs, which collaboratively amplify properties of another phase and interpenetrating piezoelectric phase composites (IP2Cs), which offer special advantages over conventional ones. We compiled comprehensive data on IPCs, emphasizing their effective properties, mechanical performance, fatigue and fracture behavior, energy absorption capacity, and coupled electromechanical characteristics. Furthermore, the commercial applications of architectured IPCs across industries are highlighted, along with a critical analysis of current research, identifying gaps and challenges. It highlights their pivotal role in advancing technology and addressing contemporary challenges while illuminating the uncharted possibilities presented by TPMS cellular structures in the dynamic landscape of 3D printing.
