Nano-ZrO2: A review on synthesis methodologies ZrO2-based nanomaterials have attracted tremendous attention in a variety of applications due to their biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability. A vast range of synthesis pathways has been utilized to fabricate ZrO2 nanostructures. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed review of the methods for the synthesis of nano-ZrO2. Firstly, the basic concept of every synthesis route is introduced. Secondly, different morphologies and crystallite structures of nano-ZrO2 from every synthesis route are discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, the variables that affect the particle size, crystalline structure and crystallite size are introduced in detail. Though synthesis methods like sol-gel, hydrothermal, and spray pyrolysis are more prevalent for the large-scale production of nano-ZrO2, there are obstacles to overcome for future applications. In addition to the improvement of innovative synthesis routes, an adequate synthesis of nano-ZrO2 on large scale can be developed.
