Study on the bond cleavage behavior of oxygen-containing structure during pyrolysis upgrading of Zhaotong lignite To understand the bond cleavage behavior of the oxygen-containing structure during lignite pyrolysis, the pyrolysis experiments of Zhaotong (ZT) lignite were carried out at 300–600 °C. The main focuses are the form and the migration behavior of oxygen elements at different temperatures. The C-O content in ZT exceeds that of CO and COOH. In temperature region below 450 °C, the CO, COOH in ZT are cleaved, generating a large amount of CO2 and CO, while at 450 °C, the structure containing Cal-O, CO are cleaved with the formation of oxygenated liquid components, such as phenols, acids, as well as ketones, resulting in an increase of oxygen in the tar from 1.32 wt% at 300 °C to 4.12 wt% at 450 °C. With the increasing temperature, the demethoxy, dealkylation reaction, and ester bond cleavage are significant, resulting in the reduction of alkylphenols and ester compounds. At high temperatures, the cleavage and rearrangement of the methoxy group to form phenol and methylphenol, and the cleavage of Car-O with higher bond dissociation energy leads to a decrease in phenols of tar, and O of char. The pyrolysis upgrading could change the oxygen distribution of the products and significantly reduce the oxygen content of ZT.
