You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the bond cleavage behavior of oxygen-containing structure during pyrolysis upgrading of Zhaotong lignite To understand the bond cleavage behavior of the oxygen-containing structure during lignite pyrolysis, the pyrolysis experiments of Zhaotong (ZT) lignite were carried out at 300–600 °C. The main focuses are the form and the migration behavior of oxygen elements at different temperatures. The C-O content in ZT exceeds that of CO and COOH. In temperature region below 450 °C, the CO, COOH in ZT are cleaved, generating a large amount of CO2 and CO, while at 450 °C, the structure containing Cal-O, CO are cleaved with the formation of oxygenated liquid components, such as phenols, acids, as well as ketones, resulting in an increase of oxygen in the tar from 1.32 wt% at 300 °C to 4.12 wt% at 450 °C. With the increasing temperature, the demethoxy, dealkylation reaction, and ester bond cleavage are significant, resulting in the reduction of alkylphenols and ester compounds. At high temperatures, the cleavage and rearrangement of the methoxy group to form phenol and methylphenol, and the cleavage of Car-O with higher bond dissociation energy leads to a decrease in phenols of tar, and O of char. The pyrolysis upgrading could change the oxygen distribution of the products and significantly reduce the oxygen content of ZT.
