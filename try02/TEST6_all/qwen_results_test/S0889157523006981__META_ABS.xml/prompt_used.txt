You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Detection of chloramphenicol in dairy products based on biogas residue biochar based electrochemical sensor Although N-doped carbon has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in chloramphenicol (CAP) detection of dairy products, traditional fossil energy sources are costly to develop and environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, in this paper, corn straw biogas residue was selected to prepare biochar, which was an excellent electrode material with simple preparation, high specific surface area, rich pore structure, and good electrical conductivity. A simple, fast and sensitive voltammetric sensor for CAP detection was prepared by using biogas residue biochar and dopamine hydrochloride as raw materials to prepare a biogas residue biochar @polydopamine (BRB@PDA) composite modified glassy carbon electrode and electrodepositing β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) onto the modified electrode. The electrochemical performance of the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE), β-CD/GCE, BRB@PDA/GCE and β-CD/BRB@PDA/GCE modified electrodes showed that BRB@PDA had excellent electrical conductivity and the deposition of β-CD and BRB@PDA on the electrode surface significantly improved the electron transfer performance. The linear concentration range of the sensor was 5.0 × 10−7-5.0 × 10−4 mol L−1 with a detection limit of 2.0 × 10−8 mol L−1 (S/N = 3), and it showed good reproducibility, satisfactory sensitivity and high specificity. The good accuracy and reliability of β-CD/BRB@PDA/GCE were demonstrated by spiked recovery experiments. Based on the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of β-CD/BRB@PDA/GCE, a significant electrochemical signal could be obtained for the detection of chloramphenicol in dairy products. The results reflected the electrochemical performance of the digestate biochar and also indicated that the digestate biochar material had good application prospects in electrochemical detection.
