You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Porous and high surface area silicon oxycarbide-based materials—A review Silicon oxycarbide (SiOC)-based materials are a class of polymer-derived ceramics that enables the formation of a homogeneous structure at the molecular level starting from polymer precursors. In this system, oxygen and carbon atoms share bonds with silicon atoms in the amorphous network structure while elemental carbon, and possibly nanosized SiO2 and SiC nanodomains may co-exist. Because of the flexibility of molecular level composition and microstructure designs, the systems can be made porous with high specific surface areas by changing the precursor compositions and the ceramization conditions. In this review, two strategies of creating porous SiOCs are discussed: conventional approach of using fugitive fillers, as well as pore formation and selective removal of certain SiOC matrix compositions (such as carbon, SiO2, or SiC) at the molecular level. For the former, it includes ceramic replication of an organic template, direct foaming, and sacrificial pore formers. For the latter, it includes molecular level pore formation, molecular level species removal, and SiOC porous network creation through molecular templates. Direct pore formation can be achieved by changing processing conditions, using different precursor architectures, and using different hydrosilylation agents. For SiOC porous network creation through molecular level species removal, it includes molecular level free carbon removal, molecular level SiO2 nanocluster removal, and molecular level carbon removal from SiC (and possibly BC x for SiOBC). To understand single nanometer (<10nm) pore formation and phase separation for selective species removal, SiOC nanostructure models and composition descriptions after the pyrolysis are explained.
