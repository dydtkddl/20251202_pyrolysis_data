Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste using activated carbon from cotton waste This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste management and energy recovery by synthesizing highly porous activated carbon from an often-overlooked resource, waste cotton fabric (WCF), using H3PO4 as an activating agent. The synthesized waste cotton fabric activated carbon samples (WCF-AC) were utilized as a solid acid catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), with the aim of converting LDPE into fuel-range hydrocarbons. This research highlights the potential of bio-based waste materials in the synthesis of eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts for feedstock recycling. The impact of the H3PO4 impregnation ratio and the carbonization/activation temperature on the physicochemical properties of the resulting WCF-AC samples was investigated, providing valuable insights into the optimization of activated carbon production. The catalytic activity of the synthesized WCF-AC samples was evaluated, demonstrating a reduction of 12°C in the LDPE degradation temperature. Furthermore, this work revealed a substantial increase in the formation of carbocyclic compounds, with light aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and xylene constituting up to 43 % of the pyrolysis output. In certain instances, a decrease in heavier hydrocarbons beyond C11 was observed, indicating the selective yield of specific range hydrocarbons. This study underscores the potential of bio-based acid catalysts, such as the synthesized activated carbon presented here, in plastic recycling. The approach adopted in this research aligns with the principles of the circular economy, promoting resource efficiency and sustainability.
