Fast pyrolysis of natural polysaccharides as a potential industrial process Existing technology for fast pyrolysis processes will be reviewed briefly. It will be shown that in most cases, provided certain criteria of heating rate and residence time are met, similar products will be obtained. The emphasis will be on pyrolysis in the regime of moderate temperatures and relatively short residence times which leads to high liquid yields. Effects due to the source and pretreatment of feedstocks will be outlined. Comparisons will be made with results from the scientific literature. The extent to which it is possible to alter and increase the specificity of product yields will be examined. Pyrolytic mechanisms which have been proposed and which might account for the reported experimental product spectra will be presented and analysed. Finally, based on the presently known chemistry and technology, future alternatives and possibilities will be suggested.
