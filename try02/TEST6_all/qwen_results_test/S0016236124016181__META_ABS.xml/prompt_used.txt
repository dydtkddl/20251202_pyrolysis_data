You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A machine learning–genetic algorithm based models for optimization of intensification process through microwave reactor: A new approach for rapid and sustainable synthesis of biodiesel from novel Hiptage benghalensis seed oil The depletion of fossil fuels necessitates the need for sustainable and energy-efficient biodiesel production techniques. Microwave techniques have recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional biodiesel production due to their enhanced conversion rates and reduced processing times. However, the complex chemical processes and reaction kinetics involved in biodiesel production present modeling challenges. Machine learning (ML) is well-suited for capturing intricate and nonlinear behaviors that are challenging to model using traditional mechanistic approaches. This study uses eight different machine learning (ML) models to analyze experimental datasets of biodiesel production from Hiptage benghalensis seed oil through a microwave reactor at different input parameters and operating conditions. Furthermore, tree-based pipeline optimization tools (TPOT) and genetic algorithms (GA) were used to optimize the input parameters. The results, including R2: 0.9756, MAE: 1.124, RMSE: 1.429, and MAPE: 0.014, show the gradient-boosting model’s superior predictive accuracy. It was found that a 320-W microwave power, a 5-minute reaction time, a 6:1 M ratio, and a 0.75- wt% catalyst concentration were the optimum conditions for a maximum biodiesel yield of 98.62%. Comparing conventional and microwave techniques reveals that the MW method achieves significantly higher energy efficiency, with an improvement of 8.63 times. Additionally, the reaction time is expedited by 12–15 times, and the biodiesel yield is enhanced by 6.02% compared to the conventional method.
