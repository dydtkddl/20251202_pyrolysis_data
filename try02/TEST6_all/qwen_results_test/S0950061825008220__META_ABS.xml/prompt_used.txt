You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Temperature-adaptive mechanism of bamboo fibers for regulating elevated temperature performance of UHPC Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is known for its exceptional mechanical properties due to its high density; however, this also makes it prone to explosive spalling at elevated temperatures. This study investigates the effects of bamboo fibers on UHPC under elevated temperatures, focusing on the synergistic impact of mixed bamboo and steel fibers on the material's performance. UHPC specimens were prepared with varying fiber contents (0–2.0 % steel fibers, 0–1.5 % bamboo fibers) and tested at temperatures of 200℃, 400℃, 600℃, and 800℃. The study evaluates macroscopic mechanical properties, microstructural void evolution, and thermal performance. The results reveal that bamboo fibers significantly enhance crack resistance and anti-spalling behavior. At 200℃, UHPC showed a reduction in macro-voids and an increase in micro-voids, improving mechanical performance. Between 400℃ and 600℃, bamboo fiber carbonization created channels that alleviated thermal stress and steam pressure, suppressing crack propagation and spalling. Compared with steel fiber-only UHPC, the hybrid fiber system exhibited reduced porosity, less crack propagation, and maintained compressive strength. The synergistic effect of bamboo fibers enhances material stability under elevated temperatures, with improvements in both mechanical strength and crack resistance. The presence of bamboo fibers also improves the material's overall thermal stability by mitigating the internal stresses caused by differential thermal expansion. This study provides an effective optimization strategy for UHPC in high-temperature environments.
