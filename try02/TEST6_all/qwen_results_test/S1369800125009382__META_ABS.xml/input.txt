Perovskite materials for multifaceted energy applications: From fundamental properties to industrialization challenges Perovskite materials exhibit transformative potential across energy technologies—including photovoltaics, catalysis, energy storage, and optoelectronics—due to their tunable crystal structures, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and solution processability. This review examines how dimensional engineering (0D quantum dots to 3D frameworks) harnesses quantum confinement, anisotropic charge transport, interfacial architectures, and catalytic platforms to optimize carrier dynamics and functional performance. However, widespread deployment confronts critical bottlenecks: intrinsic instability under moisture/heat/light stress, scalability limitations in large-area fabrication, environmental concerns regarding lead content, and synthesis-dependent defect control. Emerging solutions leverage synergistic strategies such as low-dimensional heterostructures for defect passivation and stability enhancement, multi-cation/halogen alloying to suppress ion migration, and advanced processing techniques for uniform film formation. Future advancements require integrated material-process co-design spanning atomic-scale lattice engineering to system-level integration. Priority directions include developing self-healing perovskite frameworks responsive to operational stressors, establishing closed-loop green manufacturing protocols, and implementing lead-immobilization strategies throughout device lifecycles. Cross-disciplinary innovation in intelligent material design and scalable production will accelerate perovskite adoption in flexible electronics, grid-storage systems, and carbon-neutral technologies, ultimately bridging the gap between laboratory breakthroughs and industrial implementation.
