You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal cracking and combustion kinetics of asphaltenes derived from Fosterton oil Thermal behavior of crude oil (Fosterton) asphaltenes mixed with reservoir sand was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in nitrogen and air atmospheres for different heating rates up to 800°C. In this study, four sets of TGA runs were performed to examine the thermal behavior of Fosterton asphaltenes and the coke derived from the asphaltenes. The parameters studied were heating rate (10, 15 and 20°C min−1) and the type of purge gas (N2 and air) employed for the process of thermal degradation of asphaltenes. Distributed activation energy model (DAEM) has been applied to study the asphaltene pyrolysis kinetics. It was observed that the activation energy was distributed from 46.16 to 72.17kJ/mol, for the conversion range of 0.1 to 0.4. The general model for nth order reaction was used to obtain the kinetic parameters of coke oxidation reaction from the TGA data. From the model, the calculated activation energy, E, was 93.46kJ/mol and the pre-exponential factor was 9.59×105 min−1 for the coke combustion. The apparent order of combustion reaction gradually increased from 0.7 to 0.8 for different temperatures.
