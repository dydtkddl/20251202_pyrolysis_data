Pyrolysis conversion of multi-layer packaging waste under a CO2 atmosphere: Thermo-kinetic study, evolved products analysis and artificial neural networks modeling Packaging waste such as beverage carton forms a significant part of municipal solid waste and its pyrolysis behavior, kinetics, and thermodynamics were studied. A four-stage decomposition process was revealed: dehydration below 200 ℃, paperboard degradation at 200–400 ℃, polyethylene devolatilization at 400–550 ℃, and inorganic decomposition at 550–900 ℃. The evolved products included furans and acetic acid during stage II, followed by the presence of 2-butene and 1-pentene in the subsequent stage. Apparent activation energy (Ea) were determined using model-free models, revealing a notable level of comparability among these results. The average Ea was 123.6 kJ/mol within α range of 0.10–0.60, increasing to 233.3 kJ/mol beyond that range. The most probable reaction mechanism was determined, with the one-dimensional model proving more reliable. An artificial neural network model was developed to predict the thermal degradation. The selected topology of 5*15*1 displayed a robust ability to predict the thermal data.
