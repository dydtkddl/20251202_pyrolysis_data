A combined gas and catalytic-phase kinetic model for ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis is a highly promising process to convert post-consumer polyolefin waste into valuable chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. These valuable olefins are a feedstock to produce new virgin plastics, hence closing the loop in the plastic lifecycle. This chemical recycling process offers many benefits over other processes, such as thermal pyrolysis, as it has a higher recycling and energy efficiency. To further examine and optimize this process, a detailed kinetic model is essential to reveal dominant reaction pathways, optimize process conditions, and expedite reactor and catalyst design. Here, a novel modeling framework is presented that explicitly considers the important elementary reactions in both the catalyst and gas-phase and accounts for all species in the plastic pyrolysis oil as catalytic cracking feedstock. This was achieved by efficiently using the state-of-the-art microkinetic model generator Genesys-Cat, an improved Bayesian optimization scheme, and incorporating a fundamental gas-phase cracking model. In this way, a kinetic model accurately describing the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over phosphorus-modified mesoporous ZSM-5 between 500 and 700 °C was obtained. As a result, we could reveal the relative contribution of gas-phase and catalytic reactions, present the dominant reaction pathways, and optimize the process conditions. These advancements benefit both the ecological and economic potential of ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis to recycle plastic waste.
