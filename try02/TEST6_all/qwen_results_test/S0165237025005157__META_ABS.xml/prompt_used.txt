You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A combined gas and catalytic-phase kinetic model for ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis is a highly promising process to convert post-consumer polyolefin waste into valuable chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. These valuable olefins are a feedstock to produce new virgin plastics, hence closing the loop in the plastic lifecycle. This chemical recycling process offers many benefits over other processes, such as thermal pyrolysis, as it has a higher recycling and energy efficiency. To further examine and optimize this process, a detailed kinetic model is essential to reveal dominant reaction pathways, optimize process conditions, and expedite reactor and catalyst design. Here, a novel modeling framework is presented that explicitly considers the important elementary reactions in both the catalyst and gas-phase and accounts for all species in the plastic pyrolysis oil as catalytic cracking feedstock. This was achieved by efficiently using the state-of-the-art microkinetic model generator Genesys-Cat, an improved Bayesian optimization scheme, and incorporating a fundamental gas-phase cracking model. In this way, a kinetic model accurately describing the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over phosphorus-modified mesoporous ZSM-5 between 500 and 700 °C was obtained. As a result, we could reveal the relative contribution of gas-phase and catalytic reactions, present the dominant reaction pathways, and optimize the process conditions. These advancements benefit both the ecological and economic potential of ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis to recycle plastic waste.
