You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sodium titanium tris(glycolate) as a catalyst for the chemical recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) via glycolysis and repolycondensation Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was chemically recycled through glycolysis with ethylene glycol (EG) and repolycondensation of its main depolymerized product bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET). In this process, synthesized sodium titanium tris(glycolate) was used as a new catalyst for both reactions. The catalytic efficiency and selectivity of sodium titanium tris(glycolate) in both reactions has been investigated and compared with conventional catalysts used in glycolysis or polycondensation. The results indicate that sodium titanium tris(glycolate) is a desirable catalyst for chemical recycling of PET because it can present high catalytic activity and selectivity not only in glycolysis but also in repolycondensation, which means high cost of the catalysts separation between two reactions during chemical recycling process could be avoided. Meanwhile, a mechanism of the glycolysis of PET catalyzed by sodium titanium tris(glycolate) was proposed based on the results of interactions among BHET, EG and catalysts revealed by infrared spectroscopy.
