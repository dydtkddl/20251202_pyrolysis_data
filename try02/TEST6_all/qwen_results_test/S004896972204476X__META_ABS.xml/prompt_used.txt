You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermally activated persulfate oxidation of ampicillin: Kinetics, transformation products and ecotoxicity The heat-activated persulfate system showed encouraging results for the destruction of the widely used antibiotic Ampicillin (AMP). AMP removal follows exponential decay, and the observed kinetic constant was enhanced with persulfate (PS) dosage at the range 50–500 mg L−1 and temperature (40–60 °C), while AMP thermolysis at 60 °C was almost negligible. The apparent activation energy was estimated to 124.7 kJ mol−1 . Alkaline conditions, water matrix constituents like bicarbonates, humic acid, and real water matrices retarded AMP oxidation. Experiments performed with tert-butanol and methanol as scavengers demonstrated the contribution of sulfate radicals as the dominant reactive species. Seven transformation products (TPs) of AMP have been identified from AMP destruction. An EC50 value equal to 187 mg L−1 was calculated for 72 h of exposure of the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana to AMP. According to the ecotoxicity experiments that conducted after treatment of AMP with PS for different reaction times, no important inhibition of microalgae was noticed for contact time of 72 h and 10 d. These results indicate the formation of no toxic AMP by-products for the applied experimental conditions.
