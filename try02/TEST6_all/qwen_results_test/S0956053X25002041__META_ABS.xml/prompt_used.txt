You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of mixed contaminated plastic wastes: Assessing the influence of polymers composition, temperature and residence time The European Union’s recycling objectives of 50 % for packaging by 2025 and 55 % by 2030 are still far from the current recycling rate of 37.8 %. Thermochemical recycling via pyrolysis might improve recovery rates, especially for challenging post-consumer dirty and contaminated plastics. Many studies focus on the pyrolysis of virgin plastics and artificial mixtures of these plastics to simulate real-world mixed plastic waste scenarios. This study examines a sample of pre-sorting waste from an Italian composting plant to represent real plastic mixtures within the collection chain. This waste contains plastics, organics, paper, and others, with plastics making up 72.18 % of the sample, primarily identified as LDPE, PP, and HDPE. The plastics were tested individually and as a mixture, mirroring the concentrations observed within the original sample, in a bench-scale semi-batch reactor at varying temperatures (420 °C, 470 °C, and 520 °C) and residence times. The analysis indicated that temperature and residence time considerably influence product yields and composition, although temperature has a more dominant effect. Wax analysis showed paraffins and olefins as the primary components, with a peak carbon number distribution in the C14-C19 range at elevated temperatures. Contaminant analysis of wax identified substantial levels of halogens and metals, posing challenges for downstream processes. Results from the mixture tests revealed that the product yields of individual polymers could be predicted as a linear combination of their behaviors, with an accuracy within a 10 % margin of error across the examined temperature range and lower residence times.
