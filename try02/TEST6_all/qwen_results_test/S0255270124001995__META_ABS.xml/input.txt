Application of rotating cone reactor for continuous biodiesel production: Effect of cone geometry and optimization of operating variables through response surface methodology (RSM) The work developed a rotating cone reactor (RCR) as a promising multifunctional reactor for continuous biodiesel production from refined palm oil (RPO) homogeneously catalysed by NaOH. The effects of rotating cone geometry, rotational speed, catalyst amount, and reactant feed flow rate on FAME yield were investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) and the Design Expert software were used to optimize the operating variables. The grooved cone surface was found to play an important role in increasing FAME yield. The model predicted a maximum FAME yield of 96.9 % at the process conditions of NaOH loading of 0.602 wt.% of oil, a feed flow rate of 298 mL/min, and a rotational speed of 751 rpm. It provided a high yield efficiency of 1.324 × 10−3 g/J and a high productivity of 0.715 mol/min at a very short residence time of 2 – 3 s. This resulted in a significant reduction in transesterification time, suggesting that the RCR is a promising multifunctional reactor for economical continuous biodiesel production.
