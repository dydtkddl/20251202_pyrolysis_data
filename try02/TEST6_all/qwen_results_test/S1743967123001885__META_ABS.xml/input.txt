Multi-objective optimization and 4E's analysis of a VCR diesel engine fueled with binary fuel mixtures of diesel and pyrolysis oil derived from different plastics waste In the present work, the best-worst multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is used to choose PP and HDPE from five waste plastic pyrolytic oils (PP, PS, HDPE, PMMA, and LDPE). For variable compression direct injection diesel engine testing, the best two fuel mixes (PP/HDPE) in varying amounts with diesel are used. Engine load (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%), compression ratio (16, 17, 18), and fuel blend (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) are tested during engine testing. The energy, exergy, emission, and economic (4Es) analysis determined the best test fuel for engine performance and emissions. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) optimized engine performance and emission. Finally, desirability function and sensitivity analysis showed that the test fuel mixture 20WPO (20%WPO+80%diesel) made from polypropylene-based waste plastics had the best performance and emission output at a compression ratio of 18 and 100% engine load.
