You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

H2 production by high-temperature pyrolysis of PEEK Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) as an emerging engineering plastic has shown a big potential in recent years to produce Hydrogen (H2) for clean energy through high-temperature pyrolysis. This paper investigates the H2 production capacity and mechanism due to the pyrolysis of PEEK at high temperatures. The results revealed that PEEK has two pyrolysis stages in the temperature ranges of 783–905 K and 905–1173 K respectively. In the first stage, approximately 45 % mass loss was observed with an activation energy of 210.55 kJ/mol. However, only 0.93 mg/g of H2 was produced. According to fourier transform infrared, the main source which generated that H2 is the small amount of H atoms caused by the C-H bonds cracking. The H atoms were then recombined into H2 in the gas phase. The second stage of pyrolysis predominates the productions of H2, with around 11 % mass loss and an activation energy of 411.47 kJ/mol occurred. The H2 yield reaches 9.84 mg/g at 1073 K in this stage. The H2 is mainly generated by dehydrogenation of benzene rings and a small amount of -CH3 and -OH bonds. As the temperature raised, free radicals released by the breakdown of PEEK network recombined, suggesting three potential pathways for H2 production: (1) the dehydrogenation recombination of phenoxybenzene radicals to form dibenzofuran, (2) the recombination of benzene radicals to form biphenyl and naphthalene, and (3) the reaction of phenol and benzene at high temperature to form dibenzofuran, leading to recombination of H atoms into H2. The overall experiment results indicate that the H2 production of PEEK primarily occurs during the high-temperature pyrolysis stages with low mass loss. This finding shed new light on the mechanisms of H2 production and resource utilization of plastics for the future.
