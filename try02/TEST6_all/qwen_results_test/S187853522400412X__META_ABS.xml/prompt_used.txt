You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-depth review of synthesis of hydroxyapatite biomaterials from natural resources and chemical regents for biomedical applications Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a popular ceramic biomaterial, which has extensively been employed in numerous biomedical applications. It has drawn the attention of scientists primarily owing to its properties similar to the bones and teeth of human beings. Due to its organic similarity, HAp has exceptional biocompatibility and can activate osteoconduction and osteoinduction occurrence. Hence, HAp has been used in a broad collection of healing applications extending from common dental implant, and bioactive coatings on grafts to purposefully premeditated drug delivery methods, and even for tissue engineering (TE) applications. The production method is essential in controlling the physicochemical properties of HAp, which in turn affects its mechanical and biological properties. The anticipated physiognomies of HAp can be accomplished using a suitable technique of production and sources. This in-depth review discussed the various natural sources of HAp, and synthesis techniques for producing HAp, alongside their advantages and disadvantages, applications, and essentials of HAp for therapeutic applications. From the review, it was found that the sol–gel route is preferred over other routes because of its even molecular mixing, high purity of products, low production temperature, and ability to synthesize nanosized particles of HAp. As a result, it is provisional that upon the cautious blend of key considerations such as sources, synthesis technique, and production parameters for the manufacture of natural HAp (NHAp), mechanical properties can be improved and the product can be employed as a drug delivery system. These are important extents for the prospect of the research.
