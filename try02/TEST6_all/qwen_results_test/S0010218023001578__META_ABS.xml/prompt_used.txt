You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isopropylcyclohexane pyrolysis at high pressure and temperature: Part 2. Experiment and simulation Pyrolysis of isopropylcyclohexane (IPCH), which is part of some transportation fuels, has been investigated at the temperature range of 923–1526 K and pressure of 9.8–20.2 bar. Mole fraction profiles of 27 products were obtained using gas-chromatography (GC) coupled to flame ionization detector (FID). A GC–MS has been used for identification of all the products as well. At high temperature ethene is the most abundant product followed by acetylene. Benzene is the most abundant aromatic product followed by toluene as the 2nd most abundant aromatic. Detailed kinetic model comprising of 426 species and 1354 reactions has been developed which shows a reasonable agreement with the experimental data. This has been aided by detailed ab initio calculations of reaction profiles and TST/VTST calculations of rate parameters reported in Part 1 of this work. Rate of production (ROP) analysis reveals that unimolecular decomposition of IPCH (C3H7 elimination and CH3 elimination) as well as H-abstraction reaction of IPCH are responsible for IPCH consumption. Sensitivity analysis reveals that C3H7 elimination channel is the most sensitive reaction for the consumption of IPCH. On the other hand, cyclohexyl radical (cC6H11) plays a critical role in the formation of aromatic products (as revealed by sensitivity analysis). Its β-C–H scission process (cC6H11 = cC6H10 + H) has positive effect on aromatic formation, while its isomerization via ring-opening (cC6H11 = P6XC6H11–1E) has negative effect on aromatic formation. The overall rate constant for IPCH decomposition has been found to be: ( s − 1 ) = 10 8.16 ± 0.25 ex p ( − 34.6 ± 1.5 / kcal mo l − 1 ) R T These results could aid in our understanding of the unimolecular decomposition of IPCH as well as the aromatic products formation reaction pathways from IPCH and other similar hydrocarbons, which will eventually help us to understand better the combustion process of transportation fuels.
