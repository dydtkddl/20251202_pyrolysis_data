Adjustment of textural and acidic properties of aluminum oxide by modifying the product of thermo-chemical activation of gibbsite with acids in hydrothermal conditions The paper considers the effect of the modifier (nitric and sulfuric acids) on the physicochemical properties of aluminum oxide as a component (carrier) of cracking catalysts. The modifier was introduced during pre-treatment of the thermochemical activation product of gibbsite (TCA product). The article describes the influence of the amount of acids introduced during the TCA product pre-treatment stages (hydration and hydrothermal treatment (HTT)) on the acidic and textural properties of the resulting product. The activity of the obtained aluminum oxide samples during catalytic cracking of n-hexadecane, a model feedstock, was evaluated. All obtained samples were compared with aluminum oxide produced by the sulfate redeposition method. The cracking of hydrotreated vacuum gasoil on catalytic systems “aluminum oxide – zeolite Y″ was investigated.
