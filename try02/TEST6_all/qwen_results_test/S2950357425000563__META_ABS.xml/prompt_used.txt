You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Response surface methodology for optimizing pollutants elimination from wastewater using activated biochar derived from mixed biowastes The present study explores the co-carbonization of mixed date palm pits (DPPs) with chicken bones (CBs) in a fixed-bed reactor. The resulting biochar (BC) was successfully converted into activated biochar (ABC) using ZnCl2 as an activator. The optimal ABC was produced using a 2:1 ZnCl2:BC impregnation ratio at 500 °C for 60 min and 10 °C/min heating rate. The BET-specific surface area for this ABC was 531 m2/g, while its average pore diameter was 2.649 nm, signifying its mesoporous structure. The adsorption performance of chromium ion Cr (VI) and methylene blue (MB) from wastewater was examined using Box-Behnken Design (BBD) to obtain the optimal preparation conditions. The outcomes disclosed that under the ideal experimental settings (0.25 g of ABC for 180 min at 30 °C), the highest adsorptive removal of 100 mg/L Cr (VI) solution was 86.89 %. In comparison, the highest adsorptive removal of 200 mg.L−1 MB solution was 99.75 % utilizing 0.25 g of ABC for 30 min at 30 °C. The Frundlich isotherm model was determined to be a suitable fit for the experimental data. The kinetics investigation found that a pseudo-2nd-order model best suited the data, indicating chemisorption. In conclusion, mixed DPPs+CBs can be adopted as a potential and effective precursor for producing ABC with a sustainable and adsorptive material.
