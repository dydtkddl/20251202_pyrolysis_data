You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of multiple heteroatom–doped mesoporous carbon/silica composites for supercapacitors In this study we synthesized a series of tunable multiple heteroatom–doped mesoporous carbon/silica composites directly through a facile tricomponent co-assembly approach using a triazine–formaldehyde phenolic resol (N-resol) as the C and N atom source, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the Si atom source, and the diblock copolymer poly(ethylene oxide–b–ε-caprolactone) (EC) as the structure-directing template. Small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy revealed that mesophase transformations of the N-resol/EC/TEOS hybrids, from double-gyroid to cylinder to lamellar structures, occurred upon increasing the TEOS content (i.e., double-gyroid at 60/40/0 and 60/40/5; cylinder at 60/40/10; lamellar at 60/40/20 and 60/40/30; short-range-order structure at 60/40/50). After removing the EC template by heating sequentially at 400 and 700 °C, the resultant multiple heteroatom–doped mesoporous carbon/silica composites had high N atom (up to 13.0 wt%), O atom (up to 21.5 wt%), and Si atom (up to 6.8 wt%) contents and double-gyroid, cylinder, and wormlike mesostructures. These multiple heteroatom–doped mesoporous carbon/silica composites had exceptionally high supercapacitor efficiencies, with excellent electrochemical specific capacitances (up to 827 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1) and very high stabilities (up to 96.64% at a current density of 10 A g−1 for up to 10 000 cycles). Such mesoporous carbon/silica composites would appear to have tremendous potential for use as high-performance supercapacitors in energy storage applications.
