You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flash pyrolysis of coals: behaviour of three coals in a 20 kg h−1 fluidized-bed pyrolyser Flash pyrolysis of Loy Yang brown coal, and Liddell and Millmerran bituminous coals has been studied using a fluidized-bed reactor with a nominal throughput of 20 kg h−1. The apparatus and its performance are described. The yields of tar and hydrocarbon gases are reported for each coal in relation to pyrolysis temperature, as also are analytical data on the pyrolysis products. The peak tar yields for the dry, ash-free Loy Yang and Millmerran coals were respectively 23% wt/wt (at ≈ 580 °C) and 35% wt/wt (at $ ̃ 600 °C). The tar yield from Liddell coal was 31% wt/wt at ≈ 580 °C. Hydro-carbon gases were produced in notable quantities during flash pyrolysis; e.g. Millmerran coal at 810 °C gave 6% wt/wt (daf) methane, 0.9% wt/wt ethane, 6% wt/wt ethylene, and 2.5% wt/wt propylene. The atomic H C ratios and the absolute levels of hydrogen in product tars and chars decreased steadily with increasing pyrolysis temperature.
