Flash pyrolysis of coals: behaviour of three coals in a 20 kg h−1 fluidized-bed pyrolyser Flash pyrolysis of Loy Yang brown coal, and Liddell and Millmerran bituminous coals has been studied using a fluidized-bed reactor with a nominal throughput of 20 kg h−1. The apparatus and its performance are described. The yields of tar and hydrocarbon gases are reported for each coal in relation to pyrolysis temperature, as also are analytical data on the pyrolysis products. The peak tar yields for the dry, ash-free Loy Yang and Millmerran coals were respectively 23% wt/wt (at ≈ 580 °C) and 35% wt/wt (at $ ̃ 600 °C). The tar yield from Liddell coal was 31% wt/wt at ≈ 580 °C. Hydro-carbon gases were produced in notable quantities during flash pyrolysis; e.g. Millmerran coal at 810 °C gave 6% wt/wt (daf) methane, 0.9% wt/wt ethane, 6% wt/wt ethylene, and 2.5% wt/wt propylene. The atomic H C ratios and the absolute levels of hydrogen in product tars and chars decreased steadily with increasing pyrolysis temperature.
