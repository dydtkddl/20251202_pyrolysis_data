You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Compositional and biochemical activity evaluation of highly polymerized tea pigments in black tea based on natural deep eutectic solvent extraction Highly polymeric tea pigments (HPTPs) in black tea have not been comprehensively analyzed because of the complex composition of their structural components. 14 natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) were evaluated for extracting HPTPs from black tea, and choline chloride-urea (ChCl-UA) was selected as the best candidate. The HPTPs were separated from the NADES using a dialysis membrane. Microstructural analysis was conducted by XRD, SEM, and AFM, combined with thermal property analysis using TG-DSC and Py-GC–MS determination of biochemical components, and structural analysis through UV–visible, FT-IR, NMR, and SERS spectroscopies. The antioxidant activity analyzed using ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays. The results revealed that the extract obtained using the ChCl-UA has a higher tea pigment content, greater polymerization degree, and simpler impurities. The extraction of HPTPs using a NADES and the analysis of the chemical composition and structural characteristics of the extract are helpful for understanding the macromolecular pigments in tea.
