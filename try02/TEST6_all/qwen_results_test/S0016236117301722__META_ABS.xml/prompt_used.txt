You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On the development of a polyolefin gasification modelling approach Gasification is a promising alternative for polymeric waste valorization when mechanical recycling is unfeasible on account of its heterogeneity or partial contamination, or simply when it yields a product of lower quality than what the market requires. Apart from its application for electricity generation, the waste-derived syngas shows a great potential for chemical waste recycling for the synthesis of hydrogen, methane, natural gas or methanol. In spite of the effort devoted so far to the experimental demonstration of these processes to enable this technology to access commercial stage, it is still necessary to develop detailed models of the process that allow a precise prediction of the resulting syngas composition, as well as tar formation and global efficiency of the process. This research work presents the development of a polyolefin gasification model for fluidized bed reactors. The model details the behaviour of primary pyrolysis and homogeneous reactions of oxidation, steam reforming, aromatization and thermal cracking. To accomplish this, it adopts new modelling strategies for the definition of primary tar species in order to reflect their twofold nature (aliphatic and aromatic), as well as to describe kinetics and stoichiometry involved in thermal cracking processes of tar species. The model is able to successfully predict the generation, volume composition and heating value of the syngas, final tar generation and global efficiency of the process.
