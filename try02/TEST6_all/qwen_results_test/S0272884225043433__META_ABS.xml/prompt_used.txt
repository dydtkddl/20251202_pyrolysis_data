You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of CeO2-supported catalysts for regulating CNTs synthesis from plastic wastes The recycling of plastic wastes is key to not only the development of circular economy, but also the safety of living environment. Herein, CeO2 support was prepared and used to fabricate Fe/CeO2 catalyst, which facilitated CNTs synthesis from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and real plastic wastes (RPW). The catalysts and carbon products were analyzed by XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, XPS, N2 physisorption, H2-TG, H2-TPR, TG-DSC and Raman. It was found that Fe/CeO2 catalyst effectively regulated CNTs growth under various operating conditions, obtaining (1) the uniform, regular, long and straight CNTs, (2) the high CNTs yield of 1090.0 mg/g or (3) the excellent crystallinity and graphitization degree of CNTs. Furthermore, Fe-based catalysts with commercial supports (CeO2(nm), Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2) were fabricated and used for CNTs synthesis from PE, which were taken as the reference to reveal the unique role of Fe/CeO2 catalyst in regulating CNTs synthesis. Compared with CeO2(nm), Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 supports, CeO2 support exhibited a smaller crystallite and particle size, enhanced the reducibility and improved the metal-support interaction, which was positive to the growth of long-straight CNTs. The unique role of Fe/CeO2 catalyst in regulating CNTs synthesis was inherent for different carbon sources including plastic wastes and hydrocarbons. This work may provide a new research direction for catalyst design and preparation towards fine-tuning the synthesis of CNTs from plastic wastes.
