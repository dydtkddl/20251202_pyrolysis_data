Experimental studies on low-temperature pyrolysis of municipal household garbage—temperature influence on pyrolysis product distribution The low-temperature pyrolysis of the mixture of nine typical components from municipal household garbage has been experimentally studied in an externally heated fixed-bed pyrolyser, at temperatures ranging from 300 to 700°C. The yields of final pyrolysis product varying with temperatures are presented in this paper. The solid product yield decreases with the increase of temperature in the test temperature range, and reduces quickly at 300–550°C but very slowly at 550–700°C. However, the pyrolysis liquid yield increases with the increase of temperature, but reaches the maximum at 550°C, and afterwards begins to decline. Among liquid product, cream-shaped tar is found, the yield of which also reaches the maximum at 550°C. The pyrolysis gas yield steadily increases with the increase of temperature at the whole test temperature range. The above-mentioned experimental results could be helpful to the practical application of low-temperature pyrolysis of municipal household garbage.
