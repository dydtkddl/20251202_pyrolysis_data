You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Autocatalytic influence of different levels of arsine on the thermal stability and pyrolysis of polypropylene In this article, the pyrolysis and thermo-degradation of 11 virgin-polypropylene (virgin-PP) with different levels of arsenic in its polymer matrix, was carried out in a discontinuous quartz reactor at 500 °C. To quantify arsine (AsH3), 4 points were sampled during the PP synthesis process and a methodology was applied by GC with 4 detectors, which simultaneously and with a single injection allowed to quantify multiple components. AsH3 in propylene varied between 0.05 and 4.73 ppm and arsenic in virgin-PP residues between 0.001 and 4.32 ppm for PP0 and PP10. These generated an increase in the melt flow index from 3.0 to 24.51 and maintained a direct relationship with an R2 of 0.9993. The origin of thermo-oxidative degradation and the beginnings of virgin-PP pyrolysis are explained by the formation to aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, carboxylic acid functional groups, CO and CO2. These species caused TG and DTG curves to have atypical behavior for PP. For example, PP10 with an arsenic content of 4.32 ppm presented 3 degradation peaks at 80, 90 and 200 °C with a mass loss ratio of 22%, 18% and 55% °C−1 respectively. During pyrolysis the highest percentage of alkanes was found in PP0 with an average value of 62.4%, and the lowest values were found in PP8 to PP10, with oscillations between 0% and 1.4%. The total concentration of oxidized species for PP0 to PP10 was 2.26%, 32.7%, 43.1%, 50.9%, 59.3%, 66.2%, 75.0%, 83.0%, 89.1% and 97.5% respectively. In an O2 atmosphere ketones and carboxylic acids were only identified in PP0 to PP5. CO2 concentrations in PP5 to PP10 were of 100%.
