You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of agricultural waste to porous hydrochar for non-metallic activation of persulfate to phenol degradation via non-radical-dominated processes: Singlet oxygen and electron transfer Recently, non-radical oxidation was served as an efficient approach during pollutant degradation due to its excellent environmental applicability. However, designing a green and low-cost non-metallic catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removal of hazardous organic contaminants via non-radical-dominated processes is still challenging. Herein, porous hydrochar (PHC) was synthesized with agricultural waste of corn straw (CS) as precursor and KHCO3 as pore-forming agent, which contained mesoporous structures with defects, thus facilitating phenol adsorption (117.14 mg/g). Moreover, 20 mg/L of phenol could achieve 100% removal at a wide pH range (7.0–11.0) within 10 min by PHC/PS system. The radical pathways induced by O · H and O 2 · − had certain effect on phenol removal, while non-radical pathways ( 1 O 2 and electron transfer process) played dominant contributions. Among them, 1 O 2 was produced from the reaction between surface functional groups on PHC and PS, and electron transfer process occurred from phenol to PS via PHC as the conductor. Whether under the interference of co-existing substances or in different water matrixes, the degradation efficiency of phenol could reach above 80%, exhibiting the excellent adaptability of PHC/PS system. This study proposed a potential resource utilization method of agricultural waste to prepare non-metallic catalyst for effective water remediation.
