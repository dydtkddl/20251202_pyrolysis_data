You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Activated carbon foam composite derived from PEG400/ Terminalia Catappa as form stable PCM for sub-zero cold energy storage A novel form-stable phase change material (FSPCM) for cold energy storage has been developed using sea almond (SA) (Terminalia catappa) derived supporting matrix and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) as the basic phase change material (PCM) for energy storage. A two-step method based on pyrolysis followed by KOH activation was implemented to produce activated carbon (SAS-AC) from the sea almond shell, an agricultural waste. The SAS-AC possessed a high specific surface area and a total pore volume of 1842.6 m2/g and 0.9275 cm3/g, respectively. The Activated carbon foam (SAS-ACF) was used as the supporting matrix for the PCM. Good chemical compatibility observed between the PCM and the SAS-ACF was validated using Fourier transform infrared analysis. The contact angle of 46.6o found between PEG 400 and SAS-ACF confirmed excellent wettability. The thermal conductivity of the FSPCM was found to be 0.411 W/m K, which was 82.66% higher than that of pristine PEG 400 (0.225 W/m K). A melting temperature and an enthalpy of −6.87 °C and 26.53 J/g were obtained for the FSPCM. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) proved the excellent thermal stability of FSPCM. The performance of the FSPCM was analyzed using a custom made experimental setup. All the results indicated that the developed FSPCM has a great potential to be used as a cold energy storage medium.
