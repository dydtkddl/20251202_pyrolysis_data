You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Parametric study on the pyrolysis of manure and wood shavings In this work, a response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the effects of temperature (A), feed rate (B) and gas flow rate (C) on the liquid yield, char yield and pH of the biocrude oil. Box–Behnken design was chosen and a total number of 15 experimental runs including 3 center runs were generated for the pyrolysis of a mixture of 50 wt.% layer manure and 50 wt.% loblolly pine wood shavings in a 50 mm bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The operational variables were as follows: temperature (400–550 °C), nitrogen gas flow rate (12–24 L/min), and feed rate (160–480 g/h). A second-order regression models were used to predict the responses. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with Minitab 16 software and the significant effect of the factors and their interaction effects were tested at 95% confidence interval. The biocrude yield was significantly influenced by temperature, feed rate and gas flow rate. Temperature was the only significant factor that influenced the char yield. Maximum biocrude yield (51.1 wt.%) was achieved at 475 °C with a feed rate of 480 g/h and a gas rate of 12 L/min. The lowest char yield (22.6 wt.%) was achieved at 550 °C, 320 g/h and 12 L/min and the biocrude had the highest pH (4.85) at 475 °C, 160 g/h and 24 L/min. The predictive models proposed agreed with the experimental values.
