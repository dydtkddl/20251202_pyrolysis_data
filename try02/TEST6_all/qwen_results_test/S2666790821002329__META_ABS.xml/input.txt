Recycling of fiber reinforced composites with a focus on thermoplastic composites With an increasing demand for composite materials in many fields, awareness concerning their waste management collection and treatment is rising. An overview of the composite recycling sector highlights the main challenges as well as the implementation of legal restrictions on waste disposal leading to the need to establish a good collection system and develop more sustainable waste treatment solutions. The following of the review presents existing techniques, among which we can cite mechanical, thermal and chemical processes, whose aim was mainly focused on the recovery of the reinforcement fraction as the first use was mainly dedicated to thermoset composites. With the emergence of thermoplastic composites, novel routes are under investigation to leverage the re-melting and re-moulding properties of the thermoplastic matrix while still preserving the thermomechanical properties of the fibers. Several research and projects currently explored are being presented here. Despite these intensive and on-going research, the recycling composite sector still suffers from an uncertainty in the whole waste treatment chain caused by several factors, which makes it difficult to invest in the recycling and the re-manufacturing of these materials. Research gaps as well as logistical obstacles were identified to put forward the intensive efforts needed for the sustainability of this sector.
