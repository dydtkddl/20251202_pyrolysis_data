You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of fiber reinforced composites with a focus on thermoplastic composites With an increasing demand for composite materials in many fields, awareness concerning their waste management collection and treatment is rising. An overview of the composite recycling sector highlights the main challenges as well as the implementation of legal restrictions on waste disposal leading to the need to establish a good collection system and develop more sustainable waste treatment solutions. The following of the review presents existing techniques, among which we can cite mechanical, thermal and chemical processes, whose aim was mainly focused on the recovery of the reinforcement fraction as the first use was mainly dedicated to thermoset composites. With the emergence of thermoplastic composites, novel routes are under investigation to leverage the re-melting and re-moulding properties of the thermoplastic matrix while still preserving the thermomechanical properties of the fibers. Several research and projects currently explored are being presented here. Despite these intensive and on-going research, the recycling composite sector still suffers from an uncertainty in the whole waste treatment chain caused by several factors, which makes it difficult to invest in the recycling and the re-manufacturing of these materials. Research gaps as well as logistical obstacles were identified to put forward the intensive efforts needed for the sustainability of this sector.
