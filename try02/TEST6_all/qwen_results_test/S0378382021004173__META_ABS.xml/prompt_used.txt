You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanism analysis of gas products from catalytic pyrolysis of tire rubber based on reaction thermodynamics and kinetics In this paper, the gas products from pyrolysis of tire rubber was respectively studied by fixed bed pyrolysis experiments—gas chromatography analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. The results of experiments showed that the main gas products of pyrolysis were CH4, H2, and C2H4. The simulation results showed that the long rubber chain broke into four main rubber monomers at low temperature: isoprene, styrene, 1,3-butadiene and uncondensated C4H6·. And at higher temperature, the generated monomers were pyrolyzed into small molecule gases. Fe2O3 reduced the final pyrolysis temperature and increased the pyrolysis rate with a good catalytic reactively. And it changed the gas products distribution, in which the proportion of CH4 and H2 were promoted while the proportion of C2H4 was reduced. In order to obtain the thermodynamic and kinetic data of each reaction path, DFT calculation was carried out. The reaction paths of three major radicals H·, CH3·, and CH2 = CH· were further discussed. The results showed that Fe2O3(commercial) promoted the release of CH3· from isoprene monomer and CH3· attack on isoprene monomer and 1,3-butadiene to produce CH4. Moreover, Fe2O3 promoted H· attacking styrene monomer to generate H2.
