You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photo-persulfate oxidation and mineralization of benzoic acid: Kinetics and optimization under UVC irradiation The strong oxidant, persulfate (PS, S2O8 2−), was applied to treat the synthetic wastewater of benzoic acid (BA) under UV irradiation. UVC light initiated a chain reaction that derived the sulfate radical (SO4•-) and hydroxyl radical (HO•) from S2O8 2− ion. The experiment parameters, including light irradiation (UVA and UVC), pH, dose ratio ([PS]0/[BA]0), initial concentration ([BA]0, mg/L), was optimized based on degradation efficiency and total organic carbon (TOC) removal of BA, which reached up to 100% and 96%, respectively, under pH 3.0. The best dose ratio was close to equivalent stoichiometry (and [PS]0/[BA]0 = 15) for the treatment of 100 mg-BA/L, suggesting that UV/S2O8 2− was able to completely convert BA to carbon dioxide and water. The scavenging test showed that SO4•- contributed to about 60% of degradation rate, which the HO• predominated the mineralization rate, i.e., TOC removal. A consecutive kinetic model was proposed to clarify the reaction sequence and rate-determining factor of photo-persulfate oxidation for benzoic acid.
