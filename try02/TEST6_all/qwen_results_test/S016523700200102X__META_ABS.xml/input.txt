Carbon black containing interpenetrating polymer networks based on unsaturated polyester/epoxy III: thermal and pyrolysis analysis In this study, carbon black flame retardants were chosen to improve the flame resistance of the interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) based on unsaturated polyester/epoxy due to the expansion of carbon black at elevated temperatures. The results of DSC reveal that the Tg of the IPN sample became indistinct as the carbon black was added. This is due to the increase of inorganic content. It was also found from adiabatic calorimeter that the heat of combustion of the IPN sample was decreased by the addition of carbon black flame retardants. The results of Py-GC–MS reveal that the degradation of IPNs was derived from the non-interfering thermal decomposition processes of the respective IPN components. Moreover, the degradation process of IPN was inhibited as the carbon black was added to the IPN. This led to the lower content of low molecular weight compounds and fewer species of degradation products. More detailed decomposition processes were obtained from the above-mentioned characterization, which are consistent with previous DMA and TGA studies.
