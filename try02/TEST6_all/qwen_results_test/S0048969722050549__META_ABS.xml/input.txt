Food waste valorisation via gasification – A review on emerging concepts, prospects and challenges Disposing of the enormous amounts of food waste (FW) produced worldwide remains a great challenge, promoting worldwide research on the utilization of FW for the generation of value-added products. Gasification is a significant approach for decomposing and converting organic waste materials into biochar, bio-oil, and syngas, which could be adapted for energy (hydrogen (H2) and heat) generation and environmental (removal of pollutants and improving the soil quality) applications. Employment of FW matrices for syngas production through gasification is one of the effective methods of energy recovery. This review explains different gasification processes (catalytic and non-catalytic) used for the decomposition of unutilized food wastes and the effect of operating parameters on H2-rich syngas generation. Also, potential applications of gasification byproducts such as biochar and bio-oil for effective valorization have been discussed. Besides, the scope of simulation to optimize the gasification conditions for the effective valorization of FW is elaborated, along with the current progress and challenges in the research to identify the feasibility of gasification technology for FW. Overall, this review concludes the sustainable route for conversion of unutilized food into hydrogen-enriched syngas production.
