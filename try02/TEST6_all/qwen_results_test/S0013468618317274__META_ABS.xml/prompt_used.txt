You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization of acrylonitrile and poly(acrylonitrile-b-butyl acrylate) copolymer as a precursor for N-doped mesoporous carbons The synthesis of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with precisely defined morphology is essential to obtain a polymer precursor for the preparation of high-value carbon-based materials. PAN homopolymers with very narrow molecular weight distribution were prepared by electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (eATRP) of acrylonitrile. The redox properties of the Cu complexes used as eATRP catalysts were first investigated. Convenient polymerization conditions were identified by varying the applied potential, initiator nature, monomer and catalyst loading, and targeted molecular weight (MW). PAN with high MW, 9.1×104 g mol-1, was obtained in only 3 h. A shorter PAN was extended with butyl acrylate to prepare a well-defined PAN-b-PBA copolymer, which was subjected to annealing and pyrolysis. The obtained copolymer-templated nitrogen-enriched nanocarbon was characterized by BET, TEM and Raman spectroscopy. The material showed an exceptionally high nitrogen content, together with a remarkable activity toward O2 reduction and 40% selectivity for H2O2 production.
