You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress of bio-asphalt towards green pavement development: Preparation, properties, and mechanism Bio-asphalt is a binder that is derived from bio-oil, which is extracted from fast pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass and petroleum asphalt under specific conditions or by adding other external agents to bio-oil under defined conditions. Due to its renewable and eco-friendly characteristics, bio-asphalt has immense potential to substitute petroleum asphalt and reduce the environmental impact of road construction. This paper provides a comprehensive review of research progress on bio-asphalt, including the preparation and composition of bio-oil, the preparation process and properties of bio-asphalt, modified bio-asphalt, and its modification mechanisms. Future research directions for the development of bio-asphalt are also proposed. The review indicates that most types of bio-oil can improve the low-temperature and fatigue properties of virgin asphalt but may have adverse effects on the high-temperature performance and aging resistance. To improve the performance of bio-asphalt, modifiers such as polymers, rock asphalt, montmorillonite, and nano-clay materials are used to modify bio-asphalt. The majority of existing research is focused on physical modification, with relatively little attention given to chemical and composite modifications. Future studies should focus on the preparation process and classification of bio-oil, the development of efficient modifiers, and the mechanisms of composite-modified bio-asphalt to enhance its quality and increase its proportion of substitution for petroleum asphalt.
