3D-printed bioreactors for DNA amplification: application to companion diagnostics The aim of this work is to employ 3D printing for the fabrication of bioreactors for DNA amplification with the long term aim to use them to healthcare applications. Initially, the most suitable printing material for the amplification reactor was evaluated by testing 25 different commercially available filaments, 3D-printed through the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method. Evaluation was carried out against materials printing efficiency, compatibility with the enzymatic DNA amplification assay and transparency. The best-performing transparent material was further used for the fabrication of a cartridge with eight micro-well reactors; the latter was demonstrated to be able to perform LAMP isothermal amplification in saliva samples when placed inside a purpose-made 3D printed portable platform. The successful detection of the CYP2C19*2 mutation involved in the metabolism of clopidogrel (Plavix), a drug used as a treatment to cardiovascular diseases, demonstrates the suitability of the platform as a companion diagnostic tool, emphasizing the potential of the method as a point-of-care system.
