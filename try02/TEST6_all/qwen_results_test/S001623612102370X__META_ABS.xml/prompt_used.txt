You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2 based synergistic reaction effects with energy and exergy (2E) analysis of high density polyethylene with high ash bituminous coal for syngas production A larger accumulation of medical waste is one of the major environmental issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The segregation and use of waste plastics from medical waste as a source of fuel for syngas production are highly beneficial. In packaging plastics, high density polyethylene (HDPE) occupies 20% of the total waste plastics. Hence, the conversion of HDPE into syngas is essential for waste reduction and energy production. Further, Indian coals possess high ash content (20–40%) and hence they produce a low calorific value gas on gasification. Hence, the co-gasification of these coals with suitable fuels such as HDPE can raise the heating value of syngas. In this context, HDPE is co-gasified with a high ash Indian coal using CO2 as the gasification agent for syngas production. Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification behavior of HDPE with high ash coal (HAC) under CO2 atmosphere are analyzed by using a fixed bed reactor and a thermogravimetric analyzer. Unlike reported in the recent literature, the present study showed that a high quality syngas can be obtained from the co-gasification process (1000 °C) with the heating value of 22 MJ/m3 using CO2 as the gasification agent. The chemical reactivity between CO2 gas, coal volatiles, and ethylene molecules significantly altered the surface morphology of char, which becomes highly porous making suitable for Boudouard reaction. On the surface of char, ester, and acid functional groups are formed. The co-feeding conditions raised the cold gas efficiency by 51% and the specific exergy of syngas by seven times that of HAC.
