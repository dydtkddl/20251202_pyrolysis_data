You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review and future perspective of plastic waste recycling Plastic waste is increasing rapidly due to urbanisation and globalization. In recent decades, plastic usage increased, and the upward trend is expected to continue. Only 9% of the 7 billion tonnes of plastic produced were recycled in India until 2022. India generates 1.5 million tonnes of plastic waste (PW) every year and ranks among top ten plastic producer countries. Large amount of waste plastics could harm environment and human health. The current manuscript provides a comprehensive approach for mechanical and chemical recycling methods. The technical facets of mechanical recycling relating to collection, sorting, grading, and general management to create plastic products with additional value have been elaborated in this study. Another sustainable methods aligned with the chemical recycling using pyrolysis, gasification, hydrocracking, IH2 (Integrated Hydropyrolysis 2), and KDV (Katalytische Drucklose Verolung) techniques have also been highlighted with the critical process parameters for the sustainable conversion of plastic waste to valuable products. The review also adheres to less carbon-intensive plastic degrading strategies that take a biomimetic approach using the microorganism based biodegradation. The informative aspects covering the limitations and effectiveness of all PW technologies and its applications towards plastic waste management (PWM) are also emphasized. The existing practices in PW policy guidelines along with its economic and ecological aspects have also been discussed.
