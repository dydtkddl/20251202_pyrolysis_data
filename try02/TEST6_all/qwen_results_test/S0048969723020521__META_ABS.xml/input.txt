A critical review and future perspective of plastic waste recycling Plastic waste is increasing rapidly due to urbanisation and globalization. In recent decades, plastic usage increased, and the upward trend is expected to continue. Only 9% of the 7 billion tonnes of plastic produced were recycled in India until 2022. India generates 1.5 million tonnes of plastic waste (PW) every year and ranks among top ten plastic producer countries. Large amount of waste plastics could harm environment and human health. The current manuscript provides a comprehensive approach for mechanical and chemical recycling methods. The technical facets of mechanical recycling relating to collection, sorting, grading, and general management to create plastic products with additional value have been elaborated in this study. Another sustainable methods aligned with the chemical recycling using pyrolysis, gasification, hydrocracking, IH2 (Integrated Hydropyrolysis 2), and KDV (Katalytische Drucklose Verolung) techniques have also been highlighted with the critical process parameters for the sustainable conversion of plastic waste to valuable products. The review also adheres to less carbon-intensive plastic degrading strategies that take a biomimetic approach using the microorganism based biodegradation. The informative aspects covering the limitations and effectiveness of all PW technologies and its applications towards plastic waste management (PWM) are also emphasized. The existing practices in PW policy guidelines along with its economic and ecological aspects have also been discussed.
