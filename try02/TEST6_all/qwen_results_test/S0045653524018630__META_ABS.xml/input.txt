Acidic process fluid from hydrothermal carbonization improves dechlorination of waste PVC and produces clean solid and liquid fuels Dechlorination of waste PVC (WPVC) by hydrothermal treatment (HTT) is a potential technology for upcycling WPVC in order to create non-toxic products. Literature suggests that acids can improve the HTT process, however, acid is expensive and also results in wastewater. Instead, the acidic process fluid (PF) of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of orange peel was utilized in this study to enhance the dechlorination of WPVC during HTT. Acidic HTT (AHTT) experiments were carried out utilizing a batch reactor at 300–350 °C, and 0.25–4 h. The finding demonstrated that the dechlorination efficiency (DE) is high, which indicates AHTT can considerably eliminate chlorine from WPVC and relocate to the aqueous phase. The maximum DE of 97.57 wt% was obtained at 350 °C and 1 h. The AHTT temperature had a considerable impact on the WPVC conversion since the solid yield decreases from 56.88 % at 300 °C to 49.85 % at 350 °C. Moreover, AHTT char and crude oil contain low chloride and considerably more C and H, leading to a considerably higher heating value (HHV). The HHV increased from 23.48 to 33.07 MJ/kg when the AHTT time was raised from 0.25 to 4 h at 350 °C, indicating that the AHTT time has a beneficial effect on the HHV. The majority fraction of crude oil evaporated in the boiling range of lighter fuels include gasoline, kerosene, and diesel (57.58–83.09 wt%). Furthermore, when the AHTT temperature was raised from 300 to 350 °C at 1 h, the HHV of crude oils increased from 26.11 to 33.84 MJ/kg. Crude oils derived from AHTT primarily consisted of phenolic (50.47–75.39 wt%), ketone (20.1–36.34 wt%), and hydrocarbon (1.08–7.93 wt%) constituents. In summary, the results indicated that AHTT is a method for upcycling WPVC to clean fuel.
