You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Acidic process fluid from hydrothermal carbonization improves dechlorination of waste PVC and produces clean solid and liquid fuels Dechlorination of waste PVC (WPVC) by hydrothermal treatment (HTT) is a potential technology for upcycling WPVC in order to create non-toxic products. Literature suggests that acids can improve the HTT process, however, acid is expensive and also results in wastewater. Instead, the acidic process fluid (PF) of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of orange peel was utilized in this study to enhance the dechlorination of WPVC during HTT. Acidic HTT (AHTT) experiments were carried out utilizing a batch reactor at 300–350 °C, and 0.25–4 h. The finding demonstrated that the dechlorination efficiency (DE) is high, which indicates AHTT can considerably eliminate chlorine from WPVC and relocate to the aqueous phase. The maximum DE of 97.57 wt% was obtained at 350 °C and 1 h. The AHTT temperature had a considerable impact on the WPVC conversion since the solid yield decreases from 56.88 % at 300 °C to 49.85 % at 350 °C. Moreover, AHTT char and crude oil contain low chloride and considerably more C and H, leading to a considerably higher heating value (HHV). The HHV increased from 23.48 to 33.07 MJ/kg when the AHTT time was raised from 0.25 to 4 h at 350 °C, indicating that the AHTT time has a beneficial effect on the HHV. The majority fraction of crude oil evaporated in the boiling range of lighter fuels include gasoline, kerosene, and diesel (57.58–83.09 wt%). Furthermore, when the AHTT temperature was raised from 300 to 350 °C at 1 h, the HHV of crude oils increased from 26.11 to 33.84 MJ/kg. Crude oils derived from AHTT primarily consisted of phenolic (50.47–75.39 wt%), ketone (20.1–36.34 wt%), and hydrocarbon (1.08–7.93 wt%) constituents. In summary, the results indicated that AHTT is a method for upcycling WPVC to clean fuel.
