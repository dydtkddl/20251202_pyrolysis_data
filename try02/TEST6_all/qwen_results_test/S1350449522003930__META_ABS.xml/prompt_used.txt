You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution and mechanism for the terahertz dielectric spectrum of coal during oxidation In this paper, the dielectric spectrums of lignite during oxidation and its corresponding dielectric response mechanisms were investigated by means of THz-TDS and synchronous thermal analyzer, combined with the Clausius-Mossotti equation and chemical reaction pathway. Results indicate that dipole polarization is the dominant polarization mechanism during coal oxidation in the THz field. There are four dielectric response mechanisms, which gradually participate in the competition of polarity changes with the increase of oxidation temperature. The dielectric response of lignite shows significant temperature dependence. The dielectric constant first decreases until 150 °C due to the dewatering. From 150 °C to 275 °C, the dielectric constant tends to increase. Before 225 °C, the increase is due to the formation of more oxygen-containing bonds. Beyond 225 °C, the coupling effect of the formation of oxygen-containing bonds and the twisting deformation of the molecular chain skeleton become the main reason. Then, due to the fracture of polar bonds, the dielectric constant drops significantly until 400 °C. Beyond 400 °C, the dielectric constant increases, possibly due to enhanced electron migration. The outcomings of the current study help to identify the oxidation stage of coal and enrich the application basis of THz technology in the fields of coal fire identification and mineral processing.
