Production of co-formulants for biodiesel from waste mixtures pyrolysis oil through Fe-based catalysts This study investigates new developments of thermal catalytic pyrolysis using transition metals (Fe2+, Fe3+) supported on ZSM-5 zeolites applied to a feedstock originated from the food court areas which can be considered representative for Municipal Solid Waste(MSW).The catalytic pyrolysis runs were performed using a two-stage process configuration: thermal pyrolysis conducted at 500 °C followed by catalytic cracking of vapors. The vapor catalytic upgrading was done ex-situ by using three types of catalysts HZSM5, Fe2+HZSM5, and Fe3+HZSM5 at 300, 350, and 400 °C. The structural features inherent of the ZSM-5 zeolites and associated properties (e.g. very regular microporosity, stability, ion exchange capacity) during pyrolytic processes, as well as the ability to accommodate chemical modification via isomorphic substitution of the tetrahedral atoms in the crystal network in presence of transition metals, make them unique catalysts scavengers. This new route can be applied to target the pyrolytic process for Food Court Waste (FCW) selective conversion and obtaining valuable intermediaries for different industries. The addition of catalysts was shown to enhance FCW decomposition at lower temperatures. The most important result observed in the pyrolysis process was obtained over Fe2+ZSM- 5 which was found to be the most efficient catalyst for waste minimization leading to high bio-oil conversion (∼40 wt% at 350 °C). The catalytic pyrolysis process of FCW provides resources for specific transformations, in target raw materials, products additives or co-formulants for biofuel manufacture or upgrading.
