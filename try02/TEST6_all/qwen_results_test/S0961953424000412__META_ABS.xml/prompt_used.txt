You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of co-formulants for biodiesel from waste mixtures pyrolysis oil through Fe-based catalysts This study investigates new developments of thermal catalytic pyrolysis using transition metals (Fe2+, Fe3+) supported on ZSM-5 zeolites applied to a feedstock originated from the food court areas which can be considered representative for Municipal Solid Waste(MSW).The catalytic pyrolysis runs were performed using a two-stage process configuration: thermal pyrolysis conducted at 500 °C followed by catalytic cracking of vapors. The vapor catalytic upgrading was done ex-situ by using three types of catalysts HZSM5, Fe2+HZSM5, and Fe3+HZSM5 at 300, 350, and 400 °C. The structural features inherent of the ZSM-5 zeolites and associated properties (e.g. very regular microporosity, stability, ion exchange capacity) during pyrolytic processes, as well as the ability to accommodate chemical modification via isomorphic substitution of the tetrahedral atoms in the crystal network in presence of transition metals, make them unique catalysts scavengers. This new route can be applied to target the pyrolytic process for Food Court Waste (FCW) selective conversion and obtaining valuable intermediaries for different industries. The addition of catalysts was shown to enhance FCW decomposition at lower temperatures. The most important result observed in the pyrolysis process was obtained over Fe2+ZSM- 5 which was found to be the most efficient catalyst for waste minimization leading to high bio-oil conversion (∼40 wt% at 350 °C). The catalytic pyrolysis process of FCW provides resources for specific transformations, in target raw materials, products additives or co-formulants for biofuel manufacture or upgrading.
