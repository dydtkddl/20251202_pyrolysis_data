You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of adsorptive remediation of environmental pollutants from aqueous phase by ordered mesoporous carbon An ideal adsorbent should possess the ability of being easily fabricated, cheap to produce, and have a high adsorptive capacity for adsorbates. Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), a moderately new member of the carbonaceous family of adsorbents, has arisen as a potential adsorbent because of its distinct features such as high BET surface area, large pore size and porosity volume, tunable surface chemistry and thermo-mechanical stability. In this review paper, we have presented a systematic documentation of all the research efforts on OMC preparation, modification, characterization, and environmental application for pollutant removal. The subsequent characterizations of OMC employing different techniques, such as, N2 Adsorption-Desorption Isotherm, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, are summarized. Furthermore, we have compared the adsorption performance of different modified OMCs towards different inorganic pollutants, such as heavy metals, and various organic pollutants categorically, such as dyes, phenols and their derivatives, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alkaloids, nitrogen containing organic compounds, and vitamins. Future research directions on functionalized OMC for the adsorptive removal of emerging pollutants and other environmental applications are also provided.
