You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Monomer recovery from aluminium hydroxide high filled poly(methyl methacrylate) in a fluidized bed reactor The yield of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was optimized by pyrolysis of aluminium tri-hydroxide (ATH) filled poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), because an introducing experiment at a laboratory plant led to a yield of just 53% of methyl methacrylate at a temperature of 450°C instead of more than 90% feeding pure PMMA. Additional experiments with pyrolysis–GC–MS (Py–GC–MS) have shown that the reduction of the temperature to 400°C increases the yield significantly up to 75%. Further reduction of temperature led to an incomplete decomposition of the polymer. Reduced feed rate of PMMA to the half of the introducing experiment led also to a higher yield of MMA of 69%, while reduced gas residence time in the reactor had just a small effect. A final experiment at a temperature of 400°C and the half feed rate of PMMA increased the MMA-yield to 80%. The most of ATH was converted into aluminium oxide and water. Water leads to a partial saponification of MMA producing methacrylic acid (2–11wt% of organic products) and methanol (2–9wt%). The part of gas (2–8wt%) was higher than from the pyrolysis of other PMMA materials. The main components of the gas were carbon oxides.
