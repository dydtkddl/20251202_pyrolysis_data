Current technologies for plastic waste treatment for energy recovery, it's effects on poly aromatic hydrocarbons emission and recycling strategies Plastic waste treatment is one of the key challenges faced by many countries. Recycling of the municipal plastic waste for energy recovery is one of the key movements in reduction of plastic waste accumulation. Production of pyrolytic oil and gas products from the plastic waste massive helps to reduce the dependency of fossil fuel. In this review, the exposure of the plastic consumption has been covered. Further, energy recovery methods using the various pyrolysis reactors has been discussed in details. The motive of this review to understand the conversion of plastic waste into value added products such as bio-oil and gas and its consequences in the formation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the handling of municipal plastic waste and e-waste. Besides the impact of PAHs contamination on human health effects also reviewed. Different techniques in converting the plastic waste to energy are discussed in details. Among various pyrolysis methods, microwave assisted pyrolysis possess greater advantage over other process. By varying the type of the feedstock, particle size and temperatures of the reactor, the yield rates can be increased. In addition, by optimizing the reactor temperature their possibility of harmful gaseous products from the plastic waste can be redistricted. Burning of the plastic waste and thermal degradation process releases sixteen types of PAHs compounds to the environment. Inhaling of the PAHs compounds leads to human health effects such as cancer, respiratory diseases and childhood obesity. Thus, an attempt has been made to address the risk of PAHs in the environmental due to the plastic waste handling and its respective human health effects.
