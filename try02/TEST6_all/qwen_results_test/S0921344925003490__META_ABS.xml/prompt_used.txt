You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of polyvinyl chloride: Recent progress in pretreatment dechlorination and chlorine recycling Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the third most widely used thermoplastic globally, but its high chlorine content poses a significant threat to the environment and human health. There is an urgent need for efficient and clean recycling technologies and sustainable methods for the atomic utilization of PVC waste plastics. This paper examines advanced strategies for the upgrading and reuse of PVC waste plastics from the perspective of pretreatment, covering various thermochemical pretreatment methods such as thermal dechlorination, hydrothermal dechlorination, and solvent dechlorination. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of PVC dechlorination, with a particular emphasis on the significant advantages of cutting-edge technologies such as staged catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic co-hydrothermal treatment, and ionic liquids in the dechlorination process. Additionally, the paper discusses the research on the recycling and reutilization of dechlorinated PVC (DPVC) and chlorine elements (Cl), highlighting the potential of waste Cl recirculation. This provides comprehensive support and innovative solutions for the harmless and resourceful treatment of PVC waste and the closed-loop utilization of chlorine resources.
