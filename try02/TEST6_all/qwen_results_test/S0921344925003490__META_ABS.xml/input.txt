Chemical recycling of polyvinyl chloride: Recent progress in pretreatment dechlorination and chlorine recycling Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the third most widely used thermoplastic globally, but its high chlorine content poses a significant threat to the environment and human health. There is an urgent need for efficient and clean recycling technologies and sustainable methods for the atomic utilization of PVC waste plastics. This paper examines advanced strategies for the upgrading and reuse of PVC waste plastics from the perspective of pretreatment, covering various thermochemical pretreatment methods such as thermal dechlorination, hydrothermal dechlorination, and solvent dechlorination. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of PVC dechlorination, with a particular emphasis on the significant advantages of cutting-edge technologies such as staged catalytic pyrolysis, catalytic co-hydrothermal treatment, and ionic liquids in the dechlorination process. Additionally, the paper discusses the research on the recycling and reutilization of dechlorinated PVC (DPVC) and chlorine elements (Cl), highlighting the potential of waste Cl recirculation. This provides comprehensive support and innovative solutions for the harmless and resourceful treatment of PVC waste and the closed-loop utilization of chlorine resources.
