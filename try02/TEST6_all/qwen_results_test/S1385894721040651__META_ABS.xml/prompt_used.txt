You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects of blending seafood wastes as Co-pyrolysis feedstock on syngas production and biochar properties Common seafood wastes, chitin and oyster shell, were co-pyrolyzed in different atmospheric conditions of N2 and CO2 to investigate the effects of blending the two wastes on syngas production and adsorption capability of the produced biochar in Cu(II) adsorption. The gas analyses indicated that amendment of oyster shell to chitin pyrolysis substantially enhanced production of H2 and CO as compared to using chitin as a sole feedstock. The enhanced syngas production was deemed to arise from the catalytic effect of calcite (CaCO3) contained in oyster shell that expedited thermal decomposition of chitin. The syngas production was more pronounced in N2 condition than in CO2 condition. The biochar samples produced from co-pyrolysis in both atmospheric conditions had different mineralogical composition and surface characteristics. The biochar produced under CO2 condition showed strong pH buffering capacity to maintain the pH increase within neutral range. The maximum adsorption capacity of CO2 biochar was 2.5 times (∼1,000 mg g−1) higher than N2 biochar (∼400 mg g−1), which was attributed to the abundance of calcite particles that served as major reactive sites of ion exchange reaction with Cu(II). In overall, this study offers an effective strategic way to maximize syngas production and produce biochar with specific functionality.
