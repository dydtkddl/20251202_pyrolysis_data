You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of low-temperature pyrolysis pretreatment on the co-combustion performance of coal and waste polyvinyl chloride/tire Co-combustion of coal and municipal solid waste (MSW) is an effective method to utilize MSW and reduce CO2 emission from coal-fired power plant. However, several undesired properties of MSW (such as poor homogeneity, poor grindability, high moisture content, high chlorine content) limits the extensive application of co-combustion technology. In this study, the low-temperature pyrolysis pretreatment of typical MSW (PVC/tire) was innovatively proposed before co-combustion with coal. The H/C atomic ratio of PVC char and tire char was similar to common sub-bituminous coal and bituminous coal. After pyrolysis, large amounts of chlorine and sulfur were eliminated from PVC and tire. The graphitized structure of PVC was formed whereas the graphitized structure of tire was weakened. The ignitability, burnout characteristics and combustion reactivity of coal were improved after the addition of PVC, tire, PVC char and tire char. The comprehensive combustion characteristic index of various mixtures was also increased after pyrolysis. The highest comprehensive combustion characteristic indexes of PVC char and tire char were obtained at 325 °C and 350 °C, respectively. Obvious synergistic effects among the individual components were observed during co-combustion. The activation energy of coal was greatly decreased after the addition of PVC, tire, PVC char and tire char.
