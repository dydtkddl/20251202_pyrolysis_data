You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy-printed circuit board and plastics over HZSM-5 and HY The catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy-printed circuit board (e-PCB) and thermoplastics, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), over HZSM-5 and HY was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The catalytic pyrolysis of e-PCB over both HZSM-5 and HY eliminated the brominated compounds, mainly bromo-phenols and -bisphenol As, to some extent. The co-feeding of HDPE and PP on the catalytic pyrolysis of e-PCB over both HZSM-5 and HY revealed different debromination efficiencies due to the properties of the thermoplastics and catalysts. A comparison of HY(80) and HZSM-5(80) with the same SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (80) revealed HY(80) had a better elimination efficiency of brominated compounds during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of e-PCB and HDPE or PP because of its larger pore size than HZSM-5(80). The lowest bromine content was achieved when HDPE and HY(30) were used as the co-feeding reactant and catalyst on the pyrolysis of e-PCB due to the large pore size and high acidity of HY(30), allowing the easier diffusion of large molecular brominated bisphenol A and HDPE molecules into the pores of the catalyst and efficient catalytic intermolecular reactions in the pores of the catalyst. The catalytic co-pyrolysis of e-PCB and HDPE over HY(30) also produced large amounts of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons and mono-phenol, which can be used as fuels or chemical feedstock.
