Effect of electron injection on oxidative pyrolysis of cellulose and polypropylene Tar generation reduction and syngas upgrading are necessary for pyrolysis of biomass in terms of feasible applications of biomass-to-energy technology. This study investigated the effects of electron injection on pyrolysis of PP and cellulose. TG-DTA results showed that electron injection promoted pyrolysis of both PP and cellulose at lower temperature. Byproducts analysis using GC/MS proposed that electron injection likely produced highly reactive oxygen species which promoted tar decomposition to H2, CO2, and low-carbon hydrocarbons. In particular, electron injection activated hydration reactions of cellulose and further decomposition of cellulose degradation byproducts. Electron injection is also proposed to be conducive to activated formation of hydrocarbon radicals, which also promoted byproducts decomposition. Oxygen plays a key role to make electron injection effective on pyrolysis. According to a great effect on tar generation reduction, electron injection might be promising for biomass pyrolysis with low tar generation.
