You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Phosphor nitrile functionalized UiO-66-NH2/graphene hybrid flame retardants for fire safety of epoxy Phosphor nitrile functionalized UiO-66-NH2/graphene (G-U-H) was prepared combined a green mechanochemical method and microwave-assisted rapid method to improve the fire safety of epoxy resin (EP). The scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electron microscope and X-ray diffraction results indicated that the G-U-H exhibited sandwich-like hybrid structure. And the -OH from graphene nanoplatelets and -NH2 from UiO-66-NH2 were grafted with hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene to form covalent bonds. The obtained flame retardant was added to the EP at a different content. The flame retardancy index and cure index of EP composites were calculated, and those of EP-3 were both good. The cone calorimetry test showed that the flame retardancy of EP was improved and the flame retardant mechanism is the combination of condensed phase and gas phase with the synergistic of P, N and other elements. The physical barrier of graphene nanoplatelets and the generated more stable and denser residual char in condensed phase can effectively cut off the heat and mass transmission. In gas phase, the non-flammable gases were generated to help reduce the heat released.
