You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave plasma synthesis of freestanding sulfur-doped few-layer graphene and the impact of the dopant on the electrical transport properties: Experiment and simulation This study investigates the formation of freestanding sulfur-doped few-layer graphene (FLG) during microwave plasma synthesis and the impact of the doping on its physicochemical and electrical properties. Varying the molar concentration of the sulfur dopant shows for low concentrations (<10 mol%) an increase in the electrical conductivity of powder pellets compared with undoped FLG. Larger dopant concentrations (≥10 mol%) lead to a reduction in conductivity, which is likely linked to the formation of undesired secondary phases. The measured conductivity values are compared to predictions from Boltzmann transport theory based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of different sulfur dopant configurations. The results highlight that the multilayer structure of FLG significantly influences the stability of different defect types, showing that sulfur (S) doping in conjunction with carbon vacancies in FLG (−3.69 eV) is more favorable than graphitic doping (−2.27 eV). The transport calculations for the most stable configurations demonstrate a conductivity enhancement factor of 1.78–2.47 over the pristine sample matching the experimental observations. Thus, the experimentally observed conductivity increase could be associated with the formation of C–S–C defect structures at C vacancies.
