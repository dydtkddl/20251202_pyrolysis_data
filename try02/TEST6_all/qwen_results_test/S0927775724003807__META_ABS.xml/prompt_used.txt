You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of remote Plasma assisted WPU/CNF multilayer coating assembly on PLA film properties Disadvantages such as poor toughness, brittleness, and poor barrier properties of polylactic acid (PLA) films limit their application in packaging materials. To ameliorate this problem, in this paper, remote plasma was first employed to improve the hydrophilic properties of PLA films, followed by the layer-by-layer self-assembly (LBL) method to assemble alternate layers of cationic waterborne polyurethane (WPU) and carboxylated nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) on the surface of the remotely plasma-modified PLA films. The results showed that the best hydrophilicity of PLA films was achieved at the modification time of 180 s, pressure of 25 Pa, RF power of 100 W, and axial distance of 10 cm. With the increase of the number of WPU/CNF assembled layers, the oxygen transmission rate （OTR） and the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of PLA film decreased; when assembled to 12 layers, the OTR of PLA film decreased from 695 cm3/(m2dbar) to 3.15 cm3/(m2dbar), and the WVTR decreased from 150.50 g/(m2.24 h) to 55.41 g/(m2.24 h), under these conditions the composite PLA film can be used for packaging meat and other foods sensitive to moisture and oxygen. At the same time, the thermal stability and elongation at the break of PLA films increased with the increase in the number of coated layers. When assembled to 12 layers, the residual rate at 600 °C increased from 2.78% to 10.4%, and the elongation at break increased from 2.04% (transverse) and 2.48% (longitudinal) to 3.449% (transverse) and 5.133% (longitudinal).
