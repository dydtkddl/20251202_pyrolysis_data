Co-gasification of waste shiitake substrate and waste polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor under CO2/steam atmospheres This study investigated the co-gasification of agricultural and plastic wastes, which is a potential method for waste disposal. Waste shiitake substrate (WSS) and polyethylene (PE) were selected and their properties were investigated. The thermal degradation behavior and gases produced were explored using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR). In addition, the activation energy was determined by the FWO method, and the synergistic effect and gas yield were estimated. The co-gasification of WSS and PE assisted by CO2 and steam was conducted using a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier. Results indicate that BR60 % had the maximum C–O band, C–C bond, C–H band, and CO yields. Blending WSS and PE resulted in an evident synergistic effect. The activation energies of BR20 % had the lowest value. The Taguchi method was used to determine the optimal parameters, maximum normalized H2 concentration, H2/CO ratio, CGE, and exergy efficiency. The H2 yield and H2/CO ratio were predominantly affected by the CO2/(CO2+H2O) ratio, and the best concentration and ratio were 28.6 % and 1.34. The CGE and exergy efficiencies were predominantly affected by gasification temperature, and the best results were 71.6 % and 72.4 %, respectively. Finally, the collected tars were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
