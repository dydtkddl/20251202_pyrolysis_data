You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification of waste shiitake substrate and waste polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor under CO2/steam atmospheres This study investigated the co-gasification of agricultural and plastic wastes, which is a potential method for waste disposal. Waste shiitake substrate (WSS) and polyethylene (PE) were selected and their properties were investigated. The thermal degradation behavior and gases produced were explored using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR). In addition, the activation energy was determined by the FWO method, and the synergistic effect and gas yield were estimated. The co-gasification of WSS and PE assisted by CO2 and steam was conducted using a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier. Results indicate that BR60 % had the maximum C–O band, C–C bond, C–H band, and CO yields. Blending WSS and PE resulted in an evident synergistic effect. The activation energies of BR20 % had the lowest value. The Taguchi method was used to determine the optimal parameters, maximum normalized H2 concentration, H2/CO ratio, CGE, and exergy efficiency. The H2 yield and H2/CO ratio were predominantly affected by the CO2/(CO2+H2O) ratio, and the best concentration and ratio were 28.6 % and 1.34. The CGE and exergy efficiencies were predominantly affected by gasification temperature, and the best results were 71.6 % and 72.4 %, respectively. Finally, the collected tars were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
