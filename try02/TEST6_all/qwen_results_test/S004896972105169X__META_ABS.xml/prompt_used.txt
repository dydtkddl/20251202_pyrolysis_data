You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge and polyvinyl chloride for the production of high-quality solid fuel with low nitrogen content Sewage sludge (SS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are typical solid wastes. Their co-hydrothermal carbonization behavior was investigated in this study. The low-nitrogen solid fuel (0.94 wt%) with high heating value (9.84 MJ·Kg−1) was prepared through parameter optimization at 240 °C for 1.5 h under water loading amount of 0.84 g·cm−3. In an acidic environment, the stubborn protein in SS could be converted into free amino acids, which were generated by the decomposition of PVC under hydrothermal conditions. The stubborn N could be translated into easy-to-remove N, such as nitrile–N and inorganic N, and the dehydration reaction was evidently promoted. The acidic environment at high temperatures caused the dissolution of ash in SS and improved the combustion performance of hydrochar. FT-IR results showed that, with increased PVC loading proportion, -C=N- was converted into -C=O-. Co-hydrothermal carbonization could effectively improve the combustion performance of hydrochar. The addition of PVC could lead to the generation of increased volatile matter, fixed carbon, and unsaturated CC, and the combustion temperature range shifted to a high range. However, the generation of graphite-like carbon was caused by further increasing the PVC loading proportion, which hindered the improvement of its combustion performance. In the parameter optimization study, the increased water loading amount (from 0.54 g·cm−3 to 0.84 g·cm−3) had the most evident effect on the N content in the hydrochar (from 1.50 wt% to 0.94 wt%), which promoted the denitrification efficiency (from 60.11% to 75.00%) and the conversion of -C=N- components, and prevented further polymerization of solid products.
