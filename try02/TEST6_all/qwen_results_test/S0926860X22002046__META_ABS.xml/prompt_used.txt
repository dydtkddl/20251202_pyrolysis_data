You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular mechanism of waste polyethylene terephthalate recycling by the 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium acetate/ zinc acetate deep eutectic solvent: The crucial role of 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium cation The application of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has attracted increasing attention due to the high efficiency, biodegradability, and low toxicity of DESs. However, the relationship between the structure and activity of DESs is still ambiguous. Herein, we report an efficient 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium acetate/zinc acetate (HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2) DES catalyst for recycling waste PET based on a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. First, the HTBD-OAc/ Zn(OAc)2 DES structure, in which the HTBD-OAc moiety and Zn(OAc)2 were connected through a N-H---O hydrogen bonding interaction, was clearly determined through theoretical calculations and experimental verification. Then, the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 was found to be effective for waste PET glycolysis, where the PET conversion reached 100%, and the bis(hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate (BHET) yield reached 88.5% at 190 °C within 40 min in atmosphere. Additionally, the catalyst had high reuse performance; BHET yield remained 84.6% after the catalyst was used for over seven cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the PET glycolysis reaction mediated by the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 DES included two stages, and the 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium cation (HTBD) played a crucial role. In the first stage, the active species [Zn]-OCH2CH2OH anion was generated through proton transfer from HTBD to OAc-, which was followed by HOCH2CH2O-H bond activation through the cooperation of HTBD and Zn. In the second stage, catalytic depolymerization of PET occurred through the cooperative functions of the Zn center and HOCH2CH2O- anion ligand.
