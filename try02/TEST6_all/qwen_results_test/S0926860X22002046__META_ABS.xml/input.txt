Molecular mechanism of waste polyethylene terephthalate recycling by the 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium acetate/ zinc acetate deep eutectic solvent: The crucial role of 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium cation The application of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has attracted increasing attention due to the high efficiency, biodegradability, and low toxicity of DESs. However, the relationship between the structure and activity of DESs is still ambiguous. Herein, we report an efficient 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium acetate/zinc acetate (HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2) DES catalyst for recycling waste PET based on a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. First, the HTBD-OAc/ Zn(OAc)2 DES structure, in which the HTBD-OAc moiety and Zn(OAc)2 were connected through a N-H---O hydrogen bonding interaction, was clearly determined through theoretical calculations and experimental verification. Then, the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 was found to be effective for waste PET glycolysis, where the PET conversion reached 100%, and the bis(hydroxyalkyl) terephthalate (BHET) yield reached 88.5% at 190 °C within 40 min in atmosphere. Additionally, the catalyst had high reuse performance; BHET yield remained 84.6% after the catalyst was used for over seven cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the PET glycolysis reaction mediated by the HTBD-OAc/Zn(OAc)2 DES included two stages, and the 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]decium cation (HTBD) played a crucial role. In the first stage, the active species [Zn]-OCH2CH2OH anion was generated through proton transfer from HTBD to OAc-, which was followed by HOCH2CH2O-H bond activation through the cooperation of HTBD and Zn. In the second stage, catalytic depolymerization of PET occurred through the cooperative functions of the Zn center and HOCH2CH2O- anion ligand.
