You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycled PMMA prepared directly from crude MMA obtained from thermal depolymerization of mixed PMMA waste Recycled PMMA was prepared by directly polymerizing crude pyrolysis oils from lab-scale pyrolysis of collected industrial waste PMMA. The pyrolysis oils consisted mainly of methyl methacrylate (MMA, >85%), while the type and number of by-products from the thermal process were assigned through GC–MS analysis showing a clear correlation to the pyrolysis temperature. By-products can be removed by distillation; however, directly employing the crude oils to prepare PMMA through solution, suspension, emulsion, or casting polymerization was investigated to assess the potential for omitting this costly step. It was found that the crude pyrolysis oils could be polymerized efficiently via solution, emulsion, and casting polymerization to produce a polymer similar to the PMMA prepared from a pristine monomer. The impurities in the PMMAs prepared from the crude mixtures were investigated by extraction analyses followed by screening by GC–MS. In the case of casting polymerization, the GC–MS analysis, as expected, revealed various residual by-products, while solution and emulsion polymerization showed only very few impurities, mainly originating from the polymerization and not the feed material. Additional purification of the crude pyrolysis oils would be required for applications in casting polymerization. In contrast, direct polymerization by emulsion or solution polymerization is considered applicable for producing pristine PMMA from crude waste PMMA pyrolysis oil.
