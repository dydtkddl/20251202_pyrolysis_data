You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tandem catalytic cracking of LDPE to C2-C4 olefins over interconnected NZ@Al-meso-SiO2: Role of hierarchical porosity and acidity Catalytic upcycling offers a promising route to valorize end-of-life polyolefins as high-value chemicals, yet significant challenges remain. Adjusting the hierarchical porosity and acidity of composites can effectively enhance polyolefins cracking efficiency. Thus, systematically studying their effects on cracking performance is essential. In the presented work, the interconnected NZ@Al-meso-SiO2 composites are synthesized for the efficient tandem catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into light olefins (C2-C4). By adjusting the ZSM-5/meso-SiO2 mass ratio and the Si/Al atomic ratio, the impact of hierarchical porosity and acidity on product distribution was systematically investigated. The results indicated that medium ZSM-5/meso-SiO2 mass ratio (n = 0.3) facilitates the tandem cracking of LDPE and enhances mass transfer. The Al-meso-SiO2 component selectively pre-cracks LDPE into intermediates and subsequently timely diffusion and deep cracking of the intermediates in nanosized ZSM-5, ultimately converting into C2-C4 olefins. The low Si/Al ratio (50) demonstrates a high acid density and the Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) acid ratio, exhibits greater selectivity for light olefins compared to a higher Si/Al ratio. The optimized NZ@Al-meso-SiO2-0.3–50 delivers an impressive performance, achieving ∼50 wt% light olefin yields at 550 °C within just 15 min. This exceptional activity and selectivity significantly surpass conventional single-component catalysts, physical mixtures, as well as exceeding results reported in the literature. This rational design of synergistic tandem catalysts provides a powerful foundation for developing advanced composite materials for diverse catalytic upcycling and reaction processes.
