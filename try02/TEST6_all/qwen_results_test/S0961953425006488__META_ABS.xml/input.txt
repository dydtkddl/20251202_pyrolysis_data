Steam activation of camelina meal biochar to remediate PFOA-contaminated wastewater This study investigates the steam activation of biochar produced using camelina meal for the removal of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from industrial effluent. A response surface methodology (RSM) framework with a central composite design (CCD) was utilized to optimize important activation parameters, such as steam flow rate (5–15 mL/h), time (60–120 min), and temperature (600–900 °C). The activation process considerably influenced the surface area of the biochar, with temperature emerging as the most critical factor in the activation process. The experiment performed at optimal conditions of 899 °C, 75 min, and 14 mL/h as determined by the CCD-RSM model attains a surface area of 722 m2/g. By conducting characterizations such as FTIR and SEM, it was disclosed that adsorption performance and the porosity of the steam-activated biochar are enhanced by the presence of oxygenated functional groups. Adsorption tests showed that the steam-activated carbon adsorbed PFOA from water, reaching equilibrium in around 5 h. The results discussed emphasize the potential of using a camelina meal activated carbon as an economical, environmentally sustainable substitute for the treatment of PFAS-contaminated water systems.
