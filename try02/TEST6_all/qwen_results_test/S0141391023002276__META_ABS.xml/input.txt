How phosphinated hydroxyurethane groups improve chemical resistance and flame retardant properties of alkyd resins? A novel phosphorus containing polyhydroxyurethane (PHU) oligomer (DGGDAC-MXDA-DOPO), has been synthetized and grafted onto the remaining acid groups of alkyd resins in order to obtain hybrid poly(alkyd hydroxyurethane) (PAHU) resins with flame retardant properties. PAHU resins have demonstrated better alkali resistance than pure alkyd resins without PHU oligomer. Moreover, the grafting of PHU onto alkyd resin through the formation of amide bonds has exhibited thixotropic properties. The thermal and flame retardancy properties have been investigated through differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimeter. The alkyd resins were applied as a coating on a wood surface and fire behavior was tested by cone calorimeter analysis. The most effective coating, by taking into account, the film properties and the flame retardant behavior contains 24 wt% of PHU (1.5 wt% P) and exhibited a 40% reduction in peak of Heat Release Rate (pHRR) compared to the resins without PHU.
