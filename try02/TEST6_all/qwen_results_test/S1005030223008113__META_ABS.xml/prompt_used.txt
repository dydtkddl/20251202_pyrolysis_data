You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective dielectric attenuation for excellent microwave absorption with broadband response of carbon hollow microspheres derived from resin Carbon hollow microspheres as microwave absorption materials (MAMs) are of great significance in the research focuses owing to their lightweight, good impedance matching, and modifiable dielectric properties. However, it is still a huge challenge to distinguish the contribution of dielectric attenuation between carbon intrinsic feature and hollow structure due to the lack of appropriate model materials. Then, the inadequate analysis of effective dielectric attenuation resulted in the construction of carbon hollow microspheres semiempirical and often lacked precise modification of microstructure. Herein, a series of carbon hollow microspheres with controllable graphitization and thickness of shell derived from phenolic resin coated on polystyrene microspheres that fully decomposed were synthesized, which is free of the impact of template residue. The carbon fragments ground from hollow microspheres exhibit the same broadband response as hollow microspheres, with effective bandwidth (RL ≤ –10 dB) of 7.6 GHz, while their electromagnetic wave loss mechanisms are distinct. The high dielectric loss of carbon fragments with the same intrinsic characteristics as carbon hollow microspheres is mainly caused by dipole polarization relaxation and enhancement of electrical conductivity ascribed to overlapping between carbon sheets. For the hollow structure, in addition to dipole polarization relaxation attributed to carbon intrinsic feature, the effective dielectric loss is also comprised of the interfacial polarization in advantage due to the effective heterogeneous interface between air and carbon shell. This work provides a simplified model to clarify the effect of carbon intrinsic feature and microstructure on the dielectric loss of carbon hollow microspheres.
