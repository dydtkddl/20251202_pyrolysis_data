You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ generated SiO2 nanoparticles for heat release reduction and smoke suppression in unsaturated polyester composites Achieving lower heat release rates (HRR) during combustion is one of the key steps toward obtaining flame retardant materials. UPR thermosets, while mechanically strong and chemically durable, show high HRR upon ignition. While most commercial applications focus on blending of metal oxide or other heterogeneous fillers to reduce HRR, they have significant drawbacks like phase segregation, drop in transparency and other features which disfavor their use in UPRs. Herein, a novel, green technique to generate nSiO2 in-situ in UPRs is demonstrated. The method is designed such that the precursors act as nucleating agents covalently bonded to the UPRs and as growth fuel for the nSiO2 production. Apart from major advantages like a uniform phase distribution in the thermoset and transparency, this technique also prevents direct handling of powdered micro or nanoparticles, leading to a safer working environment for the handling of UPRs. The physical, thermal, and mechanical properties analyzed show great promise towards flame retardant composites, as the formed nanocomposite material, with 10 wt% loading of nSiO2 demonstrates a 41 % reduction in total heat release (THR) and a 52 % reduction in total smoke release (TSR), while retaining optical transmission >90 %. On combination with commercial phosphorus containing flame retardant, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), the composite shows an even greater reduction in THR and TSR, while also being self-extinguishing. These compelling features, coupled with the safe nature of generating nanoparticles in-situ, offer substantial benefits of using this nSiO2 approach towards HRR reduction in UPR-based thermosets and advocate for their use in commercial formulations.
