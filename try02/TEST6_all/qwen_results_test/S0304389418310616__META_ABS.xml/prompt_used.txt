You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of gasification biochar application on soil quality: Trace metal behavior, microbial community, and soil dissolved organic matter Compared to pyrolysis biochar (PBC), gasification biochar (GBC) differs in both composition and surface functionalities due to the use of an oxidizing purging gas. This work compares the effect of using PBC and GBC as soil amendments on the soil properties, trace metal bioavailability, soil microbial activity, and soil dissolved organic matter (DOM). Biochar-driven reduction of bioavailable metals does not necessarily result in a positive impact on the soil microbial growth. The DOM in the soil was strongly related to the soil microbial activity, as revealed by the strong correlation between the soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and soil dissolved organic carbon (r = 0.957, p < 0.01). Three identified fluorescent components (C1, C2, C3) in the soil DOM were closely associated with the soil microbial activity, for instance, with a clear positive correlation between the soil DHA and C1 (r = 0.718, p < 0.05) and a significant negative correlation between the total bacterial fatty acid methyl ester content and C3 (r = -0.768, p < 0.05). The bioavailability of Cd and Zn is not only related to the pH and surface functionalities of the biochar, but also to its aromatic carbon and inorganic mineral composition. This study further demonstrates that a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis is a useful tool to monitor changes in the soil quality after application of biochar, which is greatly relevant to the soil biota.
