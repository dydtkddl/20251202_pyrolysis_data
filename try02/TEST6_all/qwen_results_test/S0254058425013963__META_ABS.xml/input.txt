Flexible activated carbon fabrics from commercial textiles for electrochemical and adsorptive applications This study presents a comprehensive approach to developing flexible, highly conductive activated carbon fabric (AC-Fab) from commercial textiles, optimized for electrochemical applications. To ensure precursor compatibility, an efficient screening strategy combining experimental and spectroscopic analyses was introduced. ATR-FTIR effectively identified 100 % cotton fabrics as the only viable precursors, highlighting its potential as a fast, non-destructive screening tool. The synthesis process, involving pyrolysis, physical activation, and annealing, was optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Key responses — electrical conductivity (EC), specific surface area (SSA), and specific capacitance (Cs) — were modeled as functions of five synthesis factors, with high predictive accuracy. Optimal conditions (activation temperature: 850 °C, activation time: 90 min, H2O concentration: 1.85 %, total gas flow: 400 sccm, annealing temperature: 1000 °C), derived from a combined desirability score with customized weighting, yielded strong agreement between predicted and experimental values (EC ≈ 220–230 S m−1, SSA ≈1620–1740 m2 g−1, Cs ≈ 90–100 F g−1). Electrochemical validation confirmed outstanding performance in both supercapacitor and membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) devices. Supercapacitor electrodes exhibited a wide potential window (≈1.2 V), high Cs (≈100 F g−1), fast frequency response (τ0 ≈ 1 s), and remarkable cycling stability (≈98 % retention after 10,000 cycles). In MCDI, stable desalination was achieved across a broad voltage range, with maximum salt adsorption capacities of ≈12 mg g−1 at 1.5 V and ≈7.5 mg g−1 at 1.2 V. Optimal balance between adsorption capacity (SAC ≈4–5 mg g−1) and rate (SAR ≈3 mg g−1 min−1) occurred at a half-cycle time of ≈1.3 min (1.2 V). These findings highlight the effectiveness of RSM in application-based optimization of AC-Fab synthesis and underscore AC-Fab's potential for electrochemical energy storage and water treatment.
