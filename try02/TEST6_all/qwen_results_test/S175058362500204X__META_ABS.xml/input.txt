Pilot testing of mitigation methods for piperazine oxidation The University of Texas at Austin ran a carbon capture pilot campaign at the Separations Research Program 0.1-MWe facility to test oxidation mitigation strategies in 5 m piperazine (PZ) using the Piperazine with the Advanced Stripper (PZAS) process. A synthetic natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) flue gas with 4 % CO2 and 20 % O2 was used in the campaign. Mitigation methods tested included N2 gas sparging in the absorber sump for dissolved oxygen (DO) stripping and carbon treating of solvent for dissolved metal ion removal. NO2 was blended into the flue gas and absorbed by the solvent at a rate of 42 %. 2-oxopiperazine (OPZ) formed at the greatest concentration of the degradation products through a catalytic process at up to 10:1 molar ratio with NO2 absorbed. Mononitrosopiperazine (MNPZ) was formed at a 1:1 molar ratio with NO2 absorbed, demonstrating stoichiometric reaction behaviour. The data support the hypothesis that NO2 reacts with PZ in the absorber to form nitrite and PZ radicals (PZ•). Nitrite reacts with PZ to form MNPZ, while the PZ radicals will participate in radical propagation reactions. At a gas rate of 1 % of total gas traffic in the absorber, N2 gas sparging into the absorber sump removed 85 % of DO.
