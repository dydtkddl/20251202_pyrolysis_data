You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pilot testing of mitigation methods for piperazine oxidation The University of Texas at Austin ran a carbon capture pilot campaign at the Separations Research Program 0.1-MWe facility to test oxidation mitigation strategies in 5 m piperazine (PZ) using the Piperazine with the Advanced Stripper (PZAS) process. A synthetic natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) flue gas with 4 % CO2 and 20 % O2 was used in the campaign. Mitigation methods tested included N2 gas sparging in the absorber sump for dissolved oxygen (DO) stripping and carbon treating of solvent for dissolved metal ion removal. NO2 was blended into the flue gas and absorbed by the solvent at a rate of 42 %. 2-oxopiperazine (OPZ) formed at the greatest concentration of the degradation products through a catalytic process at up to 10:1 molar ratio with NO2 absorbed. Mononitrosopiperazine (MNPZ) was formed at a 1:1 molar ratio with NO2 absorbed, demonstrating stoichiometric reaction behaviour. The data support the hypothesis that NO2 reacts with PZ in the absorber to form nitrite and PZ radicals (PZ•). Nitrite reacts with PZ to form MNPZ, while the PZ radicals will participate in radical propagation reactions. At a gas rate of 1 % of total gas traffic in the absorber, N2 gas sparging into the absorber sump removed 85 % of DO.
