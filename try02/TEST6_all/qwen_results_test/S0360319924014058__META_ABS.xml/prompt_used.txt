You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of nanocatalysts in green hydrogen production and water splitting Hydrogen (H2) is essential for eliminating fossil fuel energy systems. It can be generated through various technological processes and from diverse sources. There is a scarcity of exhaustive studies that examine every available cutting-edge technology for hydrogen (H2) production, including the challenges associated with each process and their economic viability and sustainability. Thus, by addressing these issues, the present study ensures that future research is effectively directed toward H2 production technique enhancement. Conventional processes have substantial greenhouse gas emissions due to high production costs and limited efficiency. Water splitting offers one of the most ecologically benign manufacturing techniques when combined with renewable energy sources. While it is costly, it is plagued by hazardous byproducts that reduce efficiency. Nanoengineering catalyst techniques significantly impact green hydrogen generation due to their ability to unveil physical characteristics and structure-performance correlations. Further investigation is required to optimize machine learning performance in biohydrogen formation and H2 storage systems that are durable enough to accommodate long-distance distribution networks with sufficient fueling stations and enhance the role of nanocatalysts in renewable energy-based H2 production systems.
