The role of nanocatalysts in green hydrogen production and water splitting Hydrogen (H2) is essential for eliminating fossil fuel energy systems. It can be generated through various technological processes and from diverse sources. There is a scarcity of exhaustive studies that examine every available cutting-edge technology for hydrogen (H2) production, including the challenges associated with each process and their economic viability and sustainability. Thus, by addressing these issues, the present study ensures that future research is effectively directed toward H2 production technique enhancement. Conventional processes have substantial greenhouse gas emissions due to high production costs and limited efficiency. Water splitting offers one of the most ecologically benign manufacturing techniques when combined with renewable energy sources. While it is costly, it is plagued by hazardous byproducts that reduce efficiency. Nanoengineering catalyst techniques significantly impact green hydrogen generation due to their ability to unveil physical characteristics and structure-performance correlations. Further investigation is required to optimize machine learning performance in biohydrogen formation and H2 storage systems that are durable enough to accommodate long-distance distribution networks with sufficient fueling stations and enhance the role of nanocatalysts in renewable energy-based H2 production systems.
