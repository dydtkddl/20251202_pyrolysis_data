You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation and lumped kinetic modeling studies for upcycling of polyolefins The present work discusses on comparative kinetic analysis of the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using sophisticated lumped models. Unlike many previous studies that focused on single-polymer kinetic models or employed simplified reaction schemes, this study develops an enhanced multistep reaction network that explicitly considers both primary decomposition and secondary cracking pathways, thereby improving the accuracy of product distribution predictions. By integrating this detailed reaction framework with a robust nonlinear regression approach using LSQNONLIN and ODE45 solvers in MATLAB, the study achieved greater accuracy in estimating kinetic parameters than traditional curve-fitting methods. The findings reveal that HDPE exhibits the highest activation energy (222.97 kJ mol−1), indicating it is more thermally stable than LDPE (193.44 kJ mol−1) and PP (62.16 kJ mol−1). One of the highlights of the present work is that lower pyrolysis temperature (400 °C) is found to be optimum for liquid yield by reducing secondary cracking, which aligns with the sustainable fuel production principles. The study also emphasizes on the limitations of previous lumped models that overlooked wax decomposition pathways, which are crucial for optimizing the hydrocarbon distribution. Future research should investigate catalytic interventions and reactor design modifications to enhance the product selectivity and scalability. This study offers a more comprehensive kinetic framework for advancing the valorization of plastic waste through pyrolysis, aiding the development of efficient waste-to-fuel conversion strategies.
