You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of bio-coal, bio-methane and fertilizer from seaweed via hydrothermal carbonisation Macroalgae have emerged as a potential future source of feedstock for the production of chemicals and biofuels. The main drawbacks of macroalgae in terms of a biofuel feedstock are its low heating value (HHV), high halogen content, high ash content and high slagging and fouling propensity. In this investigation, three species of kelps; (i) Laminaria digitata (ii) Laminaria hyperborea and (iii) Alaria esculenta have been processed by hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) in a batch reactor at two temperatures (200°C and 250°C). The yields and properties of the resulting hydrochars including their HHV, CHNS, mineral content and ash fusibility properties have been determined and compared to the starting material. Significant improvement in fuel quality is observed resulting in an increase in energy density from 10MJ/kg to typically 25MJ/kg, which is comparable to that of a low rank coal. The results indicate significant demineralisation of the fuel, in particular a significant removal of alkali salts and chlorine. This results in improved combustion properties due to a reduction in the slagging and fouling properties of the fuel. Analysis of the HTC water phase indicates the presence of high levels of soluble organic carbon consisting of sugars and organic acids, and high levels of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous. The potential for production of bio-methane and recovery of nutrients following anaerobic treatment of the water phase is assessed. A prediction of the bio-methane yields for the different seaweeds has been calculated. Processing of biomass collected throughout the growth season indicates the influence of seasonal variation on energy and nutrient recovery.
