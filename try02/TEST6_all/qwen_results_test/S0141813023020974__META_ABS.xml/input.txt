Review on the oxidative catalysis methods of converting lignin into vanillin Vanillin plays an important role not only in food and flavouring, but also as a platform compound for the synthesis of other valuable products, mainly derived from the oxidative decarboxylation of petroleum-based guaiacol production. In order to alleviate the problem of collapsing oil resources, the preparation of vanillin from lignin has become a good option from the perspective of environmental sustainability, but it is still not optimistic in terms of vanillin production. Currently, catalytic oxidative depolymerization of lignin for the preparation of vanillin is the main development trend. This paper mainly reviews four ways of preparing vanillin from lignin base: alkaline (catalytic) oxidation, electrochemical (catalytic) oxidation, Fenton (catalytic) oxidation and photo (catalytic) oxidative degradation of lignin. In this work, the working principles, influencing factors, vanillin yields obtained, respective advantages and disadvantages and the development trends of the four methods are systematically summarized, and finally, several methods for the separation and purification of lignin-based vanillin are briefly reviewed.
