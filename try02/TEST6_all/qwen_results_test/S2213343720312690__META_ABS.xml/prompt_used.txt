You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chlorine removal from the pyrolysis of urban polyolefinic waste in a semi-batch reactor The pyrolysis of urban chlorine-containing polyolefinic plastic waste with simultaneous retention of HCl is investigated. Different chemical removers based on sodium, calcium and zinc bases, and different adsorbents based on alumina or zeolites were used inside the reactor or in downstream hot filters, respectively, for chlorine removal and upgrading of pyrolysis oils. Initially, polyolefin waste (POW, containing a 98.5 wt% polyolefins) was thermogravimetrically pyrolyzed to determine its thermal behaviour. Subsequently, chemical removers were mixed with the POW which was pyrolyzed at 480 °C in a semi-batch reactor. The adsorbents were tested separately in hot filters (300 ± 20 °C) downstream of the pyrolysis reactor. After the pyrolysis, the resulting char containing the chemical removers and the absorbents in the hot filters were analysed by FTIR, CHN elemental analysis and ESEM-EDS to determine their respective chlorine contents. The highest chlorine retention was 23.8 wt% for chemical remover when used in direct contact with POW, while a zeolite used in the hot filter (gas streams) gave a chlorine retention of 65.6 wt%. The pyrolytic liquids consisted of mixtures of C7-C40 hydrocarbons made up of olefinic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a very low presence of aromatics (estimated to be below 3 wt% by HPLC). In most cases, the chlorine removal processes resulted in waxier pyrolytic oils and with a higher degree of branching.
