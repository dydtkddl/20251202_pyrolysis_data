You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of blended biomass – plastic mixture using synthesized metal oxide(MO)-dolomite based catalyst Co-pyrolysis is one of the best new technologies to utilise excess of plastic waste where the products are generated in the form of oil, gas and char. A selective catalyst is needed to improve the quality of the co-pyrolysis product, in which, oil with low of oxygenated compounds content and high yield of oil are favoured. In this work, Malaysian dolomite was modified by doping with transition metals (Ni/Fe/Ca) at 10 wt% loading using the precipitation method and then compared with a modified commercial catalyst named NiO/ZSM-5 zeolite. Co-pyrolysis was conducted using empty fruit bunch (EFB) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) at 500 °C operating temperature, 10 cm3/min N2 flow rate, 10 wt% catalyst loading, 1:3 HDPE:EFB ratio and 75 g of feedstock with 60 min of operating time in a stainless-steel fluidised bed reactor. The catalysts were characterised using different analysis methods such as XRD, BET and SEM. The highest gas yield of 68% was obtained by increasing the content of calcium oxide (CaO) in dolomite (in dolomite (CaO/CMD900). For the Fe-doped dolomite (Fe3O4/CMD900), the highest oil yield (10.34 wt%) and a high content oxygenated compounds were obtained. For the Ni-doped dolomite (NiO/CMD900), the oil with the highest hydrocarbon yield (85.32 %) and low oxygenated compound (14.68 %) was obtained. This study confirms that modified dolomite can increase the yield and quality of bio-oil.
