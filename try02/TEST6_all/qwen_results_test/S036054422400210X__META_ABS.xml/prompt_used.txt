You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of carbon dioxide on pyrolytic products characteristics and DOM binding heavy metals copper in sewage sludge biochar In this study, a new method of calculation and comparison on pyrolysis products is introduced in a sealed tube furnace under different pyrolysis conditions, to explore the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) as carrier gas on biochar characteristics. In general, the pyrolysis temperature exhibited a more significant impact on biochar characteristics than residence time. The dissolved organic carbon of biochar derived in CO2 reduced by 53.5 % and 81.6 % for 30 min pyrolysis at 500 °C and 700 °C, respectively. In addition, CO2 could reduce the total heavy metals content in biochar compared with nitrogen atmosphere under the same treatment condition. Meanwhile, the soluble microbial by-products and the humic acid-like substances were more susceptible in pyrolysis with CO2, whereas the protein-like substance containing tryptophan, tryptophan related to biological and humic-like substance involved in binding copper. Actually, it was the Fact Sage thermodynamic simulation combined with main syngas composition that identified the CO2 mainly affected the carbonaceous distribution via the dehydrogenation, methane production and Boudouard reaction, made the proportion of carbon monoxide in syngas up to 18.5 % at 700 °C. These results can provide an important path for further applying CO2 as a raw material and enhance the feasibility of sewage sludge biochar application in farmland soil.
