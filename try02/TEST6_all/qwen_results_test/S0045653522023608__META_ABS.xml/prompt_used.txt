You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Environmental impacts of post-consumer plastic wastes: Treatment technologies towards eco-sustainability and circular economy The huge amounts of plastic production (millions of tons) are carried out all around world every year and EU is one of the biggest consumers of these products. In 2021, recycling rate of plastic wastes around 32.5% in the EU and the rest end up on their journey in landfills and oceans that lead to environmental pollution which is a crucial global concern. Thus, it is important to take necessary steps to control the use of such plastic and to sustainably dispose them. One of the solutions to the problem is to use a better alternative to plastics which doesn't degrade land, water or air nor affects living organisms. Circular economy is another answer to this problem, it would ensure prevention of post-consumer plastic waste from getting formed. In addition, sustainable disposal approaches for plastic waste such as pyrolysis, plasma gasification, photocatalytic degradation, and production of value-added products from polymer waste can be explored. These recycling methods has huge potential for research and studies and can play a crucial in eliminating post-consumer plastic waste. This review paper aims to discuss the environmental effects of post-consumer plastic wastes as well as the emerging approaches for the treatment of these environmental wastes towards eco-sustainability and circular economy.
