Environmental impacts of post-consumer plastic wastes: Treatment technologies towards eco-sustainability and circular economy The huge amounts of plastic production (millions of tons) are carried out all around world every year and EU is one of the biggest consumers of these products. In 2021, recycling rate of plastic wastes around 32.5% in the EU and the rest end up on their journey in landfills and oceans that lead to environmental pollution which is a crucial global concern. Thus, it is important to take necessary steps to control the use of such plastic and to sustainably dispose them. One of the solutions to the problem is to use a better alternative to plastics which doesn't degrade land, water or air nor affects living organisms. Circular economy is another answer to this problem, it would ensure prevention of post-consumer plastic waste from getting formed. In addition, sustainable disposal approaches for plastic waste such as pyrolysis, plasma gasification, photocatalytic degradation, and production of value-added products from polymer waste can be explored. These recycling methods has huge potential for research and studies and can play a crucial in eliminating post-consumer plastic waste. This review paper aims to discuss the environmental effects of post-consumer plastic wastes as well as the emerging approaches for the treatment of these environmental wastes towards eco-sustainability and circular economy.
