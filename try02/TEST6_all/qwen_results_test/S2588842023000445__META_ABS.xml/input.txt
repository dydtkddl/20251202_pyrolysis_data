Recent advances in nanostructured materials: A look at the applications in optical chemical sensing Recently, optical chemical sensors have been used to simplify traditional methods of chemical analyses. Indeed, sensing strategies based on the photoluminescence properties of nanomaterials need to be well-understood, since there are several nanomaterials with different features regarding their applicability in the optical sensor field. This review summarizes the main 0D, 1D and 2D nanomaterials used in sensing devices, with a special look in their optical properties and different methods of synthesis, as well as a briefing overview related to their colloidal stability, chemical structure and kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. In addition, the analytical performances of different optical sensing strategies are also highlighted, in which pattern recognition algorithms and the development of polymeric-based films are tools used to contribute for the application of new optical chemical sensors with exceptional sensibility and selectivity. Furthermore, this review would give some insights into advances development of optical chemical sensors, using nanomaterials of different dimensionalities.
