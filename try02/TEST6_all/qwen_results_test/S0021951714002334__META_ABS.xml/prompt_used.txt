You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From natural aluminosilicate minerals to hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites: A nanoscale depolymerization–reorganization approach In this article, we describe a novel strategy for synthesizing hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites via the nanoscale depolymerization–reorganization of natural aluminosilicate minerals. This strategy involves two important steps: the first is the top-down depolymerization of one aluminum-rich aluminosilicate mineral via a novel submolten salt system and one silicon-rich aluminosilicate mineral via conventional thermal treatment into nanoscale building blocks, and the second is the bottom-up rearrangement and reorganization of nanoscale building blocks in the synthesis system into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites. When used as a fluid catalytic cracking catalyst additive, the resulting ZSM-5 zeolite with hierarchical micro–mesoporous structure exhibited high activity and selectivity for valuable products in preliminary oil refining tests. The salient features of the strategy lie in that it neither involves any inorganic aluminum and silicon salts as precursors nor uses any secondary mesoscale template and post-treatment to create mesopores, thus demonstrating itself to be a green route to synthesizing hierarchical zeolites.
