Effect of neutron irradiation on high-temperature corrosion of titanium beryllide Be12Ti in a steam-argon environment In this paper, we investigate the high-temperature corrosion of industrial titanium beryllide Be 12 Ti following reactor irradiation at a power of 6 MW. The irradiation was conducted at an approximate temperature of 325 K and an integral neutron flux density of 1.1 × 1014 n/cm2/s. The irradiation duration lasted for 168 and 252 effective days, resulting in integral neutron fluences of 1.6 × 1021 n/cm2 for a batch of samples of the first level (F-I) and 2.3 × 1021 n/cm2 for a batch of samples of the second level (F-II). Microstructural analysis of the samples revealed that neutron irradiation induces changes in grain texture, alters the porosity of the structure, and results in the accumulation of radiation defects. These radiation-induced changes in the properties of Be 12 Ti directly influence the corrosion processes. Post-radiation corrosion experiments were performed in a steam-argon environment at varying heating rates, and the released reaction products were analyzed using mass spectrometry. The primary focus was on a comparative analysis of the material activation parameters, as well as the effect of surface microstructure evolution on reactivity. The primary indicator of H 2 O interaction with the surface was the release of atomic hydrogen, which enabled us to quantify the interaction rate parameters. In F-I samples, the intensity of hydrogen release is lower, and the release peaks are shifted to higher temperatures, attributed to an enhanced grain texture and a greater accumulation of defects. In contrast, F-II samples exhibit more active hydrogen release at lower temperatures, which is due to rapid grain transformation and a predominance of open porosity. Thus, F-II samples are characterized by higher activation energy (Ea=66 kJ/mol) and pre- exponential factor (K0=1.9 s−1), while F-I samples show lower values (Ea=50 kJ/mol, K0=0.47 s−1).
