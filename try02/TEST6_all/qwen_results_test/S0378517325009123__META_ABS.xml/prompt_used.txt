You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Harnessing ultrasonication for advanced nanocarrier synthesis: a pathway to enhanced biomedical applications The rapid advancement of nanotechnology presents challenges in developing safe and efficient methods for synthesizing nanostructures suitable for drug delivery systems. High-intensity ultrasound has emerged as a powerful sustainable tool for producing various biomedical platforms at the nanoscale. This method stands out among different nano-synthetic routes due to its intrinsic benefits, including safety, energy efficiency, scalability, and straightforward operation, as well as the ability to control size and morphology. The energy produced by ultrasonic cavitation is mainly conveyed to particles and droplets during their creation, development, and the explosive collapse of bubbles within the solvent. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the principles of ultrasonic sonochemistry and the various setups suitable for the synthesis of nanoscale drug delivery systems. It assesses a variety of drug nanocarriers synthesized through ultrasound-assisted methods, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages concerning particle size, stability, and efficiency. Recent advancements demonstrate that ultrasonically fabricated nano-sized systems significantly enhance the techno-functional activities of loaded drugs, including solubility, controlled release profiles, bioavailability, stability, and dissolution rates in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this review discusses safety considerations associated with ultrasonically prepared nanostructures and emphasizes the potential of these systems in fortifying biomedical applications.
