You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon black preparation by partial oxidation of spent tyre pyrolysis oil – Influence of temperature, residence time and oxygen to feed ratio Preparation of carbon black (CB) by partial oxidation of the spent tyre pyrolysis oil (STPO) and its heavy residue fraction (HRF) was systematically studied using a lab-scale drop tube furnace. The effect of furnace operating temperature (T: 1100 to 1400 °C), residence time (tr : 5 to 60 s) and oxygen to feed ratio (O/F: 174 to 732) on the yield and quality of CB was examined using the response surface methodology (RSM). T was shown to have the most significant influence on CB yield and properties. While the CB yield was also influenced by tr , the quality was more sensitively dependent on T and O/F. The predicted optimal tr and O/F were approximately the same for both feedstocks (60 s and 174, respectively). However, T was higher for the HRF feedstock (1368 °C) than the STPO feedstock (1331 °C) due to the abundance of more viscous heavy hydrocarbons in HRF. Validation experiments under the aforementioned conditions demonstrated the models’ ability to predict responses accurately. The CB from both feedstocks had low contents of ash (<0.03%), volatiles (∼0.5%), sulphur (<0.7%), and high carbon (≥95%). The BET surface area and average primary particle size for CB from STPO and HRF were comparable to those of commercial CBs from fossil fuel feedstock. The CB from HRF had a higher carboxyl oxygen functional group (18%) compared to the CB from STPO (∼13%) and commercial CB (<5%).
