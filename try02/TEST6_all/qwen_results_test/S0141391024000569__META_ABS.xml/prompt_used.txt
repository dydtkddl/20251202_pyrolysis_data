You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins by zeolite-based catalysts: A critical review on the structure-acidity synergies of catalysts Polyolefin plastics have become an integral part of human life, but the uncontrolled disposal of waste plastics has led to severe environmental pollution. Therefore, it is crucial to address this issue urgently. Zeolite-based catalysts, known for their exceptional catalytic activity and stability, have gained significant attention in research endeavors. Nevertheless, comparing the performance of different catalysts poses challenges due to variations in reactor types and reaction conditions. This review aims to provide an objective evaluation basis for addressing the catalytic properties of new catalytic materials. Firstly, it summarizes the characteristics of polyolefins and the Brønsted acid induced catalytic pyrolysis process mechanism. Then, the features of different reactors were analyzed, and the influence of key reaction parameters (such as temperature, reaction time, catalyst load and carrier gas flow) on catalytic performance in the most widely studied batch and semi-batch reactors and fixed bed reactors was discussed in detail. By summarizing previous findings, it is found that these parameters exhibit limited impact on the overall conversion of plastic catalytic pyrolysis under common reaction conditions. The review also examines how the structure-acidity synergies influence the catalytic pyrolysis performance of zeolite-based catalysts. Basis of evaluation is established to study the impact of structure-acidity synergies on gas yield, liquid yield, and total conversion using batch or semi-batch reactors. Similarly, evaluation basis is established for fixed bed reactors to examine the effects of structure-acidity synergies on liquid yield, aromatics yield, and BTEX yield.
