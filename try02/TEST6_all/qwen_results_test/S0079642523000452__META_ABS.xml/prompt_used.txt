You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrasonics in polymer science: applications and challenges Ultrasonic waves in a liquid media generate both chemical and mechanistic effects that are actively used to perform chemical reactions, polymer synthesis, nanoparticle synthesis, colloids, food processing and so on. The application of sonochemistry in polymer science has been an interesting topic of research in the recent years. Ultrasonication acts as an external stimulus to initiate free radical polymerization (FRP) by the homolysis of the solvent, thereby generating radicals. The recent utilization of high frequency ultrasound (>100 KHz) for polymer synthesis has evoked new interest in the use of sonochemistry in the field of polymer chemistry, especially in chain growth polymerization reactions including reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) techniques and novel applications. This review presents the principles of sonochemisty and the fundamental aspects governing the cavitation process and the radical generation process. A historical overview of the development of ultrasound-assisted polymerization with a focus on chain-growth polymerizations operating under pseudo-“living” conditions including nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is provided. The utilization of ultrasound in polymer applications such as hydrogels, biomedical nanostructures, drug delivery, nanocomposite synthesis is also discussed. Unlike conventional FRP, ultrasound-initiated polymerization does not involve any external toxic chemical initiators, adds temporal control to the polymerization process, offers excellent control over the molecular weight and the microstructure of the final polymers, etc. The ultrasound assisted polymerization is a novel, clean and green technology, which can be investigated further by coupling with thermo-, mechano- or photochemical stimuli or flow chemistry. It has the potential to be scaled up into an industrial process.
