You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Visible-light active black TiO2-Ag/TiO x particles Visible-light active materials are sought in photocatalysis and solar energy utilization. Here a material architecture active under visible-light and comprising of titanium suboxide (e.g. Ti4O7, Ti3O5) layers onto nanosilver on nanostructured TiO2 is formed by flame aerosol technology. Abundant combustion intermediates present during flame synthesis of these materials partially reduce TiO2 and induce strong metal–support interactions (SMSI) resulting in crystalline Ti-suboxides as determined by X-ray diffraction. The growth of such suboxides can be controlled through their flame spray synthesis conditions allowing for tuning the light absorption intensity in the visible spectrum. The as-prepared Ti-suboxides are stable upon annealing in air, at least, up to 350°C for 2h. Their presence on the Ag/TiO2 particle surface and efficiency in generating photoinduced charge separation under visible light is demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Under visible light (λ >400nm), these nanoparticles exhibit strong photo-reduction of cationic species (Cr6+) and photo-oxidation of organics (methylene blue).
