Exploring the performance of membrane separation under harsh operating conditions: A green approach to membrane processes Membrane processes have attracted increasing interest as a green alternative to conventional separation techniques due to their low energy consumption. However, the processes and techniques used for manufacturing polymeric membranes are often harmful to the environment and/or the health of society. So, using green polymers and solvents is a common way of synthesizing polymeric membranes in an environmentally friendly manner. Also, using inorganic membranes reduces the negative effects on the environment and human health owing to the use of less harmful materials as raw materials. One of the biggest problems facing researchers and industry is related to the operating and resistance of the membranes in harsh conditions. In other words, the limitations of applying polymeric membranes in separation processes can be the reason that determines harsh operating condition parameters of pressure, temperature, and environmental pH. Although several membranes can be found in the literature, this review has focused on the application of inorganic membranes as green membranes under harsh operating conditions. The results indicate that under harsh operational conditions, metal membranes are predominantly used in gaseous processes. In contrast, carbon and ceramic membranes have performed effectively in both wastewater treatment and gaseous processes. Notably, ceramic membranes exhibit superior performance at high temperatures and across a wide range of pH environments.
