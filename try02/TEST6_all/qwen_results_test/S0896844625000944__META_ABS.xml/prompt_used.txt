You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced decolorization behaviors of colored PET textiles by supercritical carbon dioxide as part of the recycling process Currently, most colored Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) textiles are not recycled, because the presence of dyes leads to uncontrollable coloration in chemically recycled PET products. Traditional solvent-based decolorization faces scalability challenges due to high solvent use, low efficiency, and environmental impact. This study explores scCO₂ to enhance solvent decolorization by reducing PET-dye interactions. An scCO₂-assisted decolorization process was established in a batch reactor. Optimal conditions were identified at 8 MPa, 90 °C, and solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:20, enabling 86 % disperse dye removal within 20 min. Under higher energy consumption conditions (1 h, 120 °C), the single-cycle decolorization efficiency reached 97 %. Considering the liquid phase renewal in a continuous process, repeated decolorization of the treated PET enabled complete dye removal within three cycles. The kinetics were studied with activation energy calculated. Additionally, the process did not change the structure of stripping solvents and disperse dyes, allowing for subsequent recycling and reuse.
