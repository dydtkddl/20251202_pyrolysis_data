Enhanced decolorization behaviors of colored PET textiles by supercritical carbon dioxide as part of the recycling process Currently, most colored Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) textiles are not recycled, because the presence of dyes leads to uncontrollable coloration in chemically recycled PET products. Traditional solvent-based decolorization faces scalability challenges due to high solvent use, low efficiency, and environmental impact. This study explores scCO₂ to enhance solvent decolorization by reducing PET-dye interactions. An scCO₂-assisted decolorization process was established in a batch reactor. Optimal conditions were identified at 8 MPa, 90 °C, and solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:20, enabling 86 % disperse dye removal within 20 min. Under higher energy consumption conditions (1 h, 120 °C), the single-cycle decolorization efficiency reached 97 %. Considering the liquid phase renewal in a continuous process, repeated decolorization of the treated PET enabled complete dye removal within three cycles. The kinetics were studied with activation energy calculated. Additionally, the process did not change the structure of stripping solvents and disperse dyes, allowing for subsequent recycling and reuse.
