Effect of particle attrition on gas-solid flow and heat transfer characteristics with a developed CFD-DEM model The present study employs the CFD-DEM method coupled with heat transfer and a self-developed fluidized attrition sub-model to simulate the fluidization process of particles in a fluidized bed. The accuracy of the attrition model is validated through comparative analysis with experimental data. First, the effects of different attrition mechanisms on particle abrasion, fragmentation, and gas-solid flow behavior are investigated under cold conditions. Subsequently, the effects of these mechanisms on gas-solid heat transfer characteristics are systematically investigated under thermal conditions. Thus, it provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing the gas-solid heat transfer process. The results indicate that fluidized attrition significantly affects the particle size distribution. The degree of particle abrasion is closely related to its motion patterns. Particle fragmentation primarily occurs within the range of 1.3 to 2.1 times the static bed height of the fluidized bed. Additionally, by performing a time-averaged statistical analysis of the particle volume fraction at different reaction stages, the potential erosive impact of the particles on the bed material is revealed. Under thermal conditions, the temperature response characteristics and temperature levels of particles exhibit direct correlations with their abrasion degree. Furthermore, the abrasion mechanism effectively enhances the temperature uniformity of the bed, whereas the fragmentation mechanism reduces it.
