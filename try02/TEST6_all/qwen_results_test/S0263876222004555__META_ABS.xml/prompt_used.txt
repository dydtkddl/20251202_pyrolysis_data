You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cadmium removal from wastewater by foamed magnetic solid waste-based sulfoaluminate composite biochar: Preparation, performance, and mechanism Conventional magnetic biochar presents disadvantages such as fragility and high cost of imparting magnetic properties, and its fragility leads to the risk of free dispersion and low recovery rate in field applications. To solve these problems, sulfoaluminate cement was used as cementitious material, mixed with natural magnetite and biochar, and combined with foaming technology to prepare a new granular adsorbent in this work. The adsorbent exhibited excellent properties with compressive strength (1000 mN), specific surface area (49.32 m2 g−1), and magnetic properties (13.95 emu g−1). The adsorption capacity for Cd2+ was 45.94 mg g−1 at 25 °C, and it increased with the increase of ambient temperature. The adsorption mechanism was mainly dominated by the chemical interactions of monolayer adsorption, including coordination and complexation between Cd2+ and surface functional groups (e.g. –COO–Cd, –O–Cd), Cd–π interactions on aromatic structures, and the precipitation mechanism (Cd(OH)2, CdCO3).
