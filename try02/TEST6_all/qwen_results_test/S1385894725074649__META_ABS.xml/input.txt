CuCo nanoparticles encapsulated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes for efficient and stable alkaline saline water splitting The construction of bimetallic alloys represents an effective strategy for modulating the electronic structure of metallic components, thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of electrocatalysts in overall water splitting. Herein, we successfully assemble nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) encapsulated with CuCo nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon cloth (CuCo@NCNT/CC) via a facile metal-organic framework (MOF)-templated and in situ pyrolysis strategy. Benefiting from the favorable synergistic effect between Cu and Co and the protection of NCNTs, the designed catalyst displays excellent performance at 10 mAcm−2 with low overpotentials of 59 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 218 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and only requires 1.50 V for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. Even in alkaline salt water, the catalyst expressed excellent overall water splitting performance. Detailed experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the NCNT-encapsulated CuCo NPs in CuCo@NCNT/CC contribute to optimized electronic structure for enhancing electron transfer, balanced free energy of reactants and intermediates in the sorption/desorption process, and significantly reduced reaction energy barrier for HER and OER rate-determining steps, thus improved reaction kinetics. This work provides a new in situ pyrolysis strategy for the construction of highly active, stable and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for commercial water splitting.
