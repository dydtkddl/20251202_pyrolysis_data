You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CuCo nanoparticles encapsulated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes for efficient and stable alkaline saline water splitting The construction of bimetallic alloys represents an effective strategy for modulating the electronic structure of metallic components, thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of electrocatalysts in overall water splitting. Herein, we successfully assemble nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) encapsulated with CuCo nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon cloth (CuCo@NCNT/CC) via a facile metal-organic framework (MOF)-templated and in situ pyrolysis strategy. Benefiting from the favorable synergistic effect between Cu and Co and the protection of NCNTs, the designed catalyst displays excellent performance at 10 mAcm−2 with low overpotentials of 59 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 218 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and only requires 1.50 V for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. Even in alkaline salt water, the catalyst expressed excellent overall water splitting performance. Detailed experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the NCNT-encapsulated CuCo NPs in CuCo@NCNT/CC contribute to optimized electronic structure for enhancing electron transfer, balanced free energy of reactants and intermediates in the sorption/desorption process, and significantly reduced reaction energy barrier for HER and OER rate-determining steps, thus improved reaction kinetics. This work provides a new in situ pyrolysis strategy for the construction of highly active, stable and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for commercial water splitting.
