You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potato peels as a sustainable source for biochar, bio-oil and a green heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production The sustainable processing approach has been followed to transform the potato peel as the potential source for bio-oil and green heterogeneous catalysts. The byproduct (biochar) obtained from the thermochemical conversion was reused as a green, renewable and sustainable source for heterogeneous catalysts. The alkali and alkaline-rich biochar was recovered and transformed into bio-based mixed metal oxide and carbonates through calcination. The catalyst was characterized with the Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, X-Ray Diffraction, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The best operating temperature for pyrolysis was found to be 500°C, which produced the highest bio-oil (23.60%) and relatively high bio-char (29.50%). The synthesized catalyst showed high catalytic activity due to high potassium content (36.54%) in oxide and carbonate form. The maximum oil conversion (97.50%) was obtained using the optimized parameters: temperature 60 °C; 9:1 methanol to oil ratio; time 2 h, and catalyst loading 3 wt%. The integrated catalyst synthesizing method helped to valorize the food waste to high value-added products like biochar and bio-oil, which have the property of fuel and platform chemicals. Moreover, as the catalyst is derived from biomass, it is more environmentally benign, sustainable, and recyclable.
