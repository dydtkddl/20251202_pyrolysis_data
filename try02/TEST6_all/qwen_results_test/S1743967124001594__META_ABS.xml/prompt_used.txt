You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of reaction conditions on pyrolysis performance of waste plastics loaded with Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by uniformly loading the active metal Ni to ZSM-5 zeolite using excessive wet impregnation method, and the characterization tests of XRD, SEM, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD were carried out. For the prepared Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, the pyrolysis–catalytic reforming of waste plastics for gas production performance was explored under different reaction temperatures, steam-carbon (S/C) ratio, catalyst addition amount, and plastic type. The results showed that the gas production volume and gas quality of pure pyrolysis of HDPE and catalytic pyrolysis of Ni/ZSM-5 were improved with the increase of temperature. Given the thermal economy, the optimal pyrolysis temperature was 700 °C, the catalytic gas production was 900 mL, and the hydrogen concentration was 64.4 %. S/C ratio of 1.5 and plastic: catalyst of 1 was the best reaction condition, under which the gas production was 1020 mL and the hydrogen concentration was 65.1 %, respectively. In addition, an appropriate increase in the amount of steam and the addition of catalysts would greatly optimize the final gas production performance. However, excess steam and catalysts was unfavorable to the gas production of plastic pyrolysis, resulting in a waste of resources. Finally, as for the gas production of four plastics, LDPE had the best pyrolysis gasification effect with gas yield of 1040 mL and hydrogen concentration of 65.7 %. The order of catalytic pyrolysis effect of different plastics was LDPE > HDPE > PP > PS.
