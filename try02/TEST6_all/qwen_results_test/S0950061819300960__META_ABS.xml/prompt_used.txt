You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential application of E-wastes in construction industry: A review The application of wastes and their recycled extractions to develop green construction materials attracts researchers worldwide owing to the high pessimistic environmental impact of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) industry. The current review manuscript represents an endeavour to reassess applications of abandoned electrical and electronic wastes, i.e. E-wastes, as supplementary material to develop a variety of green concretes for construction and infrastructure industries. The principal objective of this piece of review writing includes an existing and state of the art knowledge of these modern, complex, valuable but hazardous elements enclosing wastes by employing them as substitution of natural fine or coarse aggregates in concrete manufacturing. This is a new-fangled, an innovative and revolutionary concept in the direction of development of sustainable and cost-effective green concretes. Not only that, physical, chemical and metallurgical recycling processes of E-wastes, their advantages and disadvantages with thermal, strength, and durability parameters of E-wastes incorporated green concrete, as well as impacts of hazardous substances, have also been assessed. This paper also flashes a light not merely on an application of E-wastes glass of cathode ray tubes with cement paste, mortar and concrete but also an appraisal of the utilization of E-wastes materials in a bituminous mix. Also, the use of non-biodegradable recovered E-wastes plastics is reviewed as partial substitution of natural coarse or fine ingredients through this “Urban Mining” approach. This review will lend a hand to promote sustainable and affordable development of green concrete incorporating E-wastes in the construction industry and help to resolve the impasses of degradation of natural restricted aggregate resources as well as contaminations of environment, soil, and groundwater due to landfilling and of course, to safeguard the health of lives on the globe.
