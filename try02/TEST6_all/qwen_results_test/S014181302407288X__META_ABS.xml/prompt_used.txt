You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An efficient strategy to tailor PET hydrolase: Simple preparation with high yield and enhanced hydrolysis to micro-nano plastics Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nano/microplastics (PET-NMPs) are regarded as an emergent hazardous waste for the environment. Enzymatic treatment of PET-NMPs is one of the most promising methods. However, strategies for mining or engineering of PET hydrolases with better characteristics and the simple and cost-effective preparation of them are the bottlenecks currently. Herein, we proposed a gene fusion strategy to tailor PET hydrolase (ICCG) with ferritin (namely F-C) towards micro-nano PET degradation. The purified F-C was obtained by an easy scalable low-speed centrifugation with 80.8 % activity recovery and 82.9 % protein recovery compared to the crude protein extraction, with the final high yield of 2.17 g/L. Encouragingly, unlike only hydrolyzing amorphous PET (crystallinity lower than 10 %), the resulted F-C showed 84.53 mgTPA/h/mgEnzyme specific activity at 70 °C for 5 h towards micro-PET with relatively high crystallinity (20.54 %) at the optimized enzyme/PET ratio of 1:100 (Wt), without producing intermediates. The supreme activity of F-C was closely related to its enhanced affinity towards substrate, increased substrate's ester bond tensions and binding pocket volume. More interestingly, F-C exhibited promising stability not only in storage or high temperature, but also in simulated seawater (hypersaline environment), with the half-lives of 128.4 days at 30 °C. Thus, the all-in-one strategy will offer a green and alternative solution to assist the PET-NMPs waste treatments such as recycling in the high-temperature reactor or degradation in seawater.
