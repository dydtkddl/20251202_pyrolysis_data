Morphology-controlled metal-organic frameworks for enhanced photocatalytic performance The development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has transforming the field of photocatalysis due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and versatile functionalities. However, the systematic investigation of MOFs morphology and its profound influence on photocatalytic performance remains relatively unexplored. For the first time, this review comprehensively highlights the significant role of MOFs morphology in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. Key factors affecting MOFs morphology, such as defects, porosity, precursors, solvents, surfactants, post-synthesis process, ligands, computational aspects, and various synthesis methods, including hydrothermal, microwave-assisted, solvothermal, and sonochemical techniques, are briefly discussed. Seventeen distinct MOFs morphologies are examined, including nanosheets, nanofilms, nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanoparticles, quantum dots, hollow structures, hierarchical structures, sea urchin-like forms, monoliths, nanocages, core-shell, yolk-shell, aerogels, nanoflowers, and nanoribbons, with a focus on their role in optimizing photocatalytic performance. This review offers a pioneering analysis of the relationship between MOFs morphology and photocatalytic applications, which has not been previously reported. By evaluating the impact of morphology on charge transfer, light absorption, and active site exposure, this work provides new insights into the rational design of high-efficiency and cost-effective MOF-based photocatalysts. Ultimately, this review identifies key research directions for advancing MOFs photocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation.
