You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Morphology-controlled metal-organic frameworks for enhanced photocatalytic performance The development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has transforming the field of photocatalysis due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and versatile functionalities. However, the systematic investigation of MOFs morphology and its profound influence on photocatalytic performance remains relatively unexplored. For the first time, this review comprehensively highlights the significant role of MOFs morphology in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. Key factors affecting MOFs morphology, such as defects, porosity, precursors, solvents, surfactants, post-synthesis process, ligands, computational aspects, and various synthesis methods, including hydrothermal, microwave-assisted, solvothermal, and sonochemical techniques, are briefly discussed. Seventeen distinct MOFs morphologies are examined, including nanosheets, nanofilms, nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanoparticles, quantum dots, hollow structures, hierarchical structures, sea urchin-like forms, monoliths, nanocages, core-shell, yolk-shell, aerogels, nanoflowers, and nanoribbons, with a focus on their role in optimizing photocatalytic performance. This review offers a pioneering analysis of the relationship between MOFs morphology and photocatalytic applications, which has not been previously reported. By evaluating the impact of morphology on charge transfer, light absorption, and active site exposure, this work provides new insights into the rational design of high-efficiency and cost-effective MOF-based photocatalysts. Ultimately, this review identifies key research directions for advancing MOFs photocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation.
