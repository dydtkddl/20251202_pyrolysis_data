You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Complex microstructural evolution in high temperature pyrolysis of plastic and biomass Pyrolytic carbon with controlled pore structure and high surface area from produced from recycled carbonaceous materials like biomass and plastics have significant applications such as solid fuel for power plants and reductants for metallurgical process. Understanding the detailed pathways of carbon structural evolution, yields insights into the effect of temperature on chemical and physical properties and is expected to yield efficiencies in the synthesis of these heat treated carbonaceous materials. While the effect of heat treatment temperature in determining the texture, pore size, and chemical structure of pyrolytic carbon has been well studied, the influence of precursor structure and mineral content is less understood. In the present work, the differences in structural evolution during pyrolysis using fixed bed reactors, of biomass and plastics, or between biomass with different ash contents have been studied. An in depth measurement of the resulting pyrolytic carbon in the range of 600 ℃ to 1500 ℃, using Raman spectroscopy, XRD, surface area measurement, yield a detailed understanding of the structural evolution of char. The difference in characteristics between chars from biomass and plastics is shown to arise due to distinct structural evolution in the early stages of the pyrolysis while the presence of different alkali oxides in the chars influences the char characteristics at higher temperatures (>1000 ℃) via a metal ion intercalation mechanism. These structural changes are directly related to changes in the measured gasification reaction of the chars.
