You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study of coking mechanism based on the transformation of coal structure The mechanism of coal coking was investigated based on the structural transformation of coal matrix during thermoplasticity. The properties of structural units and fracture patterns of chemical bonds for different rank coals were evaluated by 13C NMR and TGA, and the thermoplasticity was characterized by Gieseler fluidity. The pyrolysis gases (CH4 and H2) were analyzed by a mass spectrometry. The components and molecular weight distributions of tars from coal pyrolysis at 500 °C were characterized by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC–MS) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), respectively. The structural unit of coal matrix is constructed and classified as S (aliphatic-aliphatic), P (aliphatic–aromatic) and C (aromatic-aromatic) layers for the first time. The softening of coal matrix initiates with the cleavage of Cal-O/Cal from S layer, which contributes to the separation of molecular structural units. With increasing temperature, the Car-Cal- and Car-O- become the active sites where the aromatic fragments from P and C layers react with small molecular clusters to form fluid phase. The maximum fluidity temperature is related to dynamic balance between the aliphatic radicals (fal/far) and the aromatic substituents (δ and S.C.). Coals with structural parameters far B = 15–19 % and fal/far = 0.38–0.40 have potential to generate the 3–5 ring aromatic clusters which are essential in affecting the fluidity. The coking processes of coals with varying thermoplastic properties are revealed based on the experimental findings.
