You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable production and purification of furfural from waste agricultural residue: An insight into integrated biorefinery Furanic chemicals are the most significant renewable bio-chemicals with furfural being the basic platform chemical that can serve as a viable alternative to replace several petroproducts. Industrial furfural production poses several drawbacks such as poor yields, highly toxic effluents, energy intensive operations and accumulation of low value solid residue that restricts its tremendous potential. In this purview, the present research maneuvered a two-step translation strategy of corncobs, an abundant agricultural residue to furfural in a cost effective as well as environmental benign manner. Initially, the corncob is hydrolyzed using an aqueous low transition temperature mixture (LTTM) that selectively converts xylan in the lignocellulose matrix to xylose without disrupting the remaining biopolymers. The obtained xylose solution is enriched through strategic recycle of the hydrolysate with a cumulative yield of 76% after four cycles which is a potential substrate for subsequent xylose dehydration without any additional catalyst. Interestingly, autocatalysis in the LTTM media could yield 70% of theoretical furfural using nitrogen as a stripping media with 44% lower dilution of the furfural condensate. Furfural is further purified through an ecofriendly extraction technique utilizing hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HDES) as an effective extractant with the highest distribution coefficient being 66.2 for 1-tetradecanol and thymol based HDES portraying 98.6% recovery. The proposed furfural production process exhibits 13.8% overall yield with respect to corncob and 30% higher recovery of cellulose in the pretreated residue compared to conventional route which presents a high value integrated biorefinery with environmental compatibility.
