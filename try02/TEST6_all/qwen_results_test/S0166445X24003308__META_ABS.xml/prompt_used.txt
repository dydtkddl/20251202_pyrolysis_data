You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Trophic transfer effects of PS nanoplastics and field-derived nanoplastics in the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea Plastic pollution is of global concern. Many studies investigated the effect of micro and nanoplatics towards aquatic organisms. However, relatively few studies were assessed on freshwater organisms. Another aspect of this pollution is the impact of trophic transfer on plastic distribution and on food chain in order to evaluate its potential risk towards environmental and human health. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess the ecotoxicological impacts of different types of nanoplastics (NPs) on freshwater organisms exposed through trophic transfer. Freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus subspicatus were contaminated for 48 h with realistic concentrations of NPs (0.008, 10 and 100 µg/L). Two types of NPs were tested: commercial PS NPs and NPs generated from macro-sized plastics collected in the field (ENV NPs). Freshwater Corbicula fluminea bivalves were then fed with the contaminated algae every 48 h for 21 days. Results showed that trophic exposure led to the induction of oxidative stress (CAT activity). Overall, NPs trophic exposure caused downregulations of genes implicated in many cellular processes (immunity, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, endocytosis, apoptosis). This present study allowed to demonstrate the relevance of investigating the trophic transfer effects of NPs on a freshwater trophic chain. Further studies should focus more on larger levels of the food chain.
