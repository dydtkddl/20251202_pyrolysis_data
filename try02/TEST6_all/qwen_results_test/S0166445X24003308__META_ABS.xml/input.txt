Trophic transfer effects of PS nanoplastics and field-derived nanoplastics in the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea Plastic pollution is of global concern. Many studies investigated the effect of micro and nanoplatics towards aquatic organisms. However, relatively few studies were assessed on freshwater organisms. Another aspect of this pollution is the impact of trophic transfer on plastic distribution and on food chain in order to evaluate its potential risk towards environmental and human health. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess the ecotoxicological impacts of different types of nanoplastics (NPs) on freshwater organisms exposed through trophic transfer. Freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus subspicatus were contaminated for 48 h with realistic concentrations of NPs (0.008, 10 and 100 µg/L). Two types of NPs were tested: commercial PS NPs and NPs generated from macro-sized plastics collected in the field (ENV NPs). Freshwater Corbicula fluminea bivalves were then fed with the contaminated algae every 48 h for 21 days. Results showed that trophic exposure led to the induction of oxidative stress (CAT activity). Overall, NPs trophic exposure caused downregulations of genes implicated in many cellular processes (immunity, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, endocytosis, apoptosis). This present study allowed to demonstrate the relevance of investigating the trophic transfer effects of NPs on a freshwater trophic chain. Further studies should focus more on larger levels of the food chain.
