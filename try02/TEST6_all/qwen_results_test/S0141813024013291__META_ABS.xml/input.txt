Ultrasonic-enhanced photocatalysis through piezoelectric and cavitation effects for lignin depolymerization Although a promising method for lignin depolymerization, photocatalysis faces the challenge of low efficiency. In this study, MoS2/ZnO heterojunction catalysts, endowed with piezocatalysis and photocatalytic capabilities, were crafted through Zn ion intercalation for the depolymerization of phenoxyphenylethanol (PP-ol) and alkali lignin. Then, the synergistic interplay between ultrasonic-induced piezoelectric fields and heterojunctions was analyzed. The amalgamation of the piezoelectric field and heterojunction in MoS2/ZnO catalysts resulted in a diminished photogenerated hole/electron recombination efficiency, thereby fostering the generation of ·OH during the reaction. This pivotal role of ·OH emerged as a crucial reactive substance, converting 95.8 % of PP-ol through β-O-4 bond breaking within a 3-h treatment. By incorporating ultrasonic, the contact probability of PP-ol with the catalyst was significantly improved, resulting in efficient conversion even with a reduced amount of acetonitrile in the solvent system (20 %). Furthermore, ultrasonic-light methods show high efficiency for depolymerizing Alkali lignin (AL), with 33.2 % of lignin undergoing depolymerization in a 4-h treatment. This treatment simultaneously reduces the molecular weight of AL and cleaves numerous chemical bonds within it. Overall, this work presents a green approach to lignin depolymerization, providing insights into the synergistic action of ultrasonic and photocatalysis.
