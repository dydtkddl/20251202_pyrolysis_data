You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrasonic-enhanced photocatalysis through piezoelectric and cavitation effects for lignin depolymerization Although a promising method for lignin depolymerization, photocatalysis faces the challenge of low efficiency. In this study, MoS2/ZnO heterojunction catalysts, endowed with piezocatalysis and photocatalytic capabilities, were crafted through Zn ion intercalation for the depolymerization of phenoxyphenylethanol (PP-ol) and alkali lignin. Then, the synergistic interplay between ultrasonic-induced piezoelectric fields and heterojunctions was analyzed. The amalgamation of the piezoelectric field and heterojunction in MoS2/ZnO catalysts resulted in a diminished photogenerated hole/electron recombination efficiency, thereby fostering the generation of ·OH during the reaction. This pivotal role of ·OH emerged as a crucial reactive substance, converting 95.8 % of PP-ol through β-O-4 bond breaking within a 3-h treatment. By incorporating ultrasonic, the contact probability of PP-ol with the catalyst was significantly improved, resulting in efficient conversion even with a reduced amount of acetonitrile in the solvent system (20 %). Furthermore, ultrasonic-light methods show high efficiency for depolymerizing Alkali lignin (AL), with 33.2 % of lignin undergoing depolymerization in a 4-h treatment. This treatment simultaneously reduces the molecular weight of AL and cleaves numerous chemical bonds within it. Overall, this work presents a green approach to lignin depolymerization, providing insights into the synergistic action of ultrasonic and photocatalysis.
