You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress in Modeling of III-Nitride MOVPE This review provides an introduction to III-Nitrides MOVPE process modeling and its application to the design and optimization of MOVPE processes. Fundamentals of the MOVPE process with emphasis on transport phenomena are covered. Numerical techniques to obtain solutions for the underlying governing equations are discussed, as well as approaches to describe multi-component diffusion for typical regimes during MOVPE. Properties of common industrial MOVPE reactor types like close spaced showerhead reactors, rotating disk reactors and Planetary Reactors are compared in terms of underlying working principles and generic process parameter dependencies. The main part of the paper is devoted to reviewing gas phase and surface reaction mechanisms during MOVPE. The process design in particular for MOVPE of III-Nitrides is determined by complex gas phase reaction kinetics. Advances in the modeling and predicting of these processes have contributed to understanding and controlling these phenomena in industrial scale MOVPE reactors. Detailed kinetics and simplified surface kinetic approaches describing the incorporation of constituents into multinary solid alloys are compared and a few application cases are presented. Differences in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of multi-layered structures of different compositions such as InGaN, AlGaN can cause enrichment of the adsorbed layer by certain group III atoms (indium in case of InGaN and gallium in case of AlGaN) that translate into specific features of composition profiles along the growth direction. An intrinsic feature of III-nitride materials is epitaxial strain that shows up in different forms during growth and affects both deposition kinetics and material quality. In case of InGaN MOVPE there is a strong interplay between indium content and strain that has direct influence on distribution of material composition in the epitaxial layers and multi-layered structures. Epitaxial strain can relax via different routes such as nucleation and evolution of the extended defects (dislocations), layer cracking and roughening of the surface morphology. Simulation approaches that address coupling of growth kinetics with strain and defect dynamics are discussed and exemplified.
