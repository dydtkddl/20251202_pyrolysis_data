You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cellulose based grafted biosorbents - Journey from lignocellulose biomass to toxic metal ions sorption applications - A review In the recent past, renewable biobased natural polymers have been explored for their variety of potential applications. Among the various biorenewable polymers, cellulose with ingrained robust characteristics such as biodegradability, nontoxicity, durability, availability, thermal and mechanical stability etc., is extensively studied. These properties can further be improved by different modification techniques, among which the grafting is considered to be the most influencive one. In this comprehensive review article, the general chemistry of the cellulose, different biological, chemical, physical, physio-chemical extraction techniques for its extraction from lignocellulosic biomass, purification and bleaching techniques for extracted cellulose, methods of cellulose grafting, mechanism of free radical grafting initiated by a variety of chemical initiators, are reviewed. Further, recent developments in the field of metal ion sorption applications of grafted cellulosic copolymers, related factors affecting the metal ion sorption efficiencies of these cellulosic biosorbents such as extent of grafting, contact time, temperature, pH, interference of other metal ions, metal ion concentration, biosorbent dose, ionic strength of solution etc. are also reviewed. Various adsorption isotherms models-Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin–Raduskevich and Redlich–Peterson; adsorption kinetic models-pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intra-particle-diffusion models, useful for studying and evaluating the different sorption parameters, mechanism, and rate of sorption of toxic and hazardous heavy metal ions, are also summarized. In the last part of the review, adsorption thermodynamics, desorption and regeneration studies for the grafted cellulosic biosorbents are also reviewed.
