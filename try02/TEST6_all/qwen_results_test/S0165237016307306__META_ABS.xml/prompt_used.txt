You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Measurement of kinetics and thermodynamics of the thermal degradation for flame retarded materials: Application to EVA/ATH/NC The modelling of the behavior of a material exposed to fire is very complex and needs the coupling of fluid dynamics, combustion, heat and mass transfer, kinetics and so forth. A growing amount of studies and numerical models are reported in this field since the last decade. The aim of these models is to predict the fire behavior of wood, charring or non-charring polymers and even intumescent materials. However, these studies are seldom applied to formulated materials and especially flame retarded materials. In this study, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was formulated with a flame retardant (aluminum tri-hydroxide) and a synergist (nanoclays). A systematic approach for the characterization of the thermo-physical properties of the material as well as of its optical properties and the heat capacity of the decomposition gases is proposed and applied in this study. It is shown that it is possible to evaluate the input data required for pyrolysis modelling, even for multi decomposition steps materials. It is also shown that the diffusion of the gases inside the material had to be considered on the opposite of the classical assumption found in other studies. Indeed, using low mass diffusivity was the sole way to predict in the same time the temperature distribution and the mass loss rate of the material in a gasification experiments.
