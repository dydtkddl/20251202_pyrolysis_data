You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Micro-nanoscale polystyrene co-exposure impacts the uptake and translocation of arsenic and boscalid by lettuce (Lactuca sativa) The influence of micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) on the fate and effects of other pollutants present in the environment is largely unknown. This study evaluated if the root exposure to MNPs (polystyrene, PS; 20 or 1000 nm) had an impact on the accumulation of arsenic and boscalid (As and Bos) in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Under hydroponic conditions, plants were co-exposed to MNPs at 10 or 50 mg/L, and to 1 mg/L of each environmental pollutant (EP). For soil-like media, plants were exposed to MNPs at 50 and EPs at 10 mg/kg. Phytotoxicity was enhanced by PS under both growth conditions, particularly by nanoscale PS (nPS), although impacts were less in potting mix-grown plants. Nanoscale PS had a greater impact than microscale PS (μPS) on As fate; the As translocation factor from roots to the edible shoots was increased 3-fold in plants exposed to nPS (50 mg/L) and EPs. PS dose and size had a variable impact on Bos uptake and translocation. Fluorescent microscopy analysis of lettuce co-exposed to MNPs and EPs suggests that nPS is entering the roots and translocating to the leaves, while μPS mostly remains in the roots. Pyrolysis-GC/MS showed that in solid media, the presence of EPs significantly increased the translocation of nPS to lettuce shoots from 4.43 ± 0.53 to 46.6 ± 9.7 mg/kg, while the concentration of μPS in the shoots remained the same regardless of the presence of EPs (ranging between 13.2 ± 5.5 to 14.2 ± 4.1 mg/kg). These findings demonstrate that co-exposure of MNPs with other EPs can significantly impact co-contaminant accumulation and toxicity, presenting an unknown risk to humans and other receptors.
