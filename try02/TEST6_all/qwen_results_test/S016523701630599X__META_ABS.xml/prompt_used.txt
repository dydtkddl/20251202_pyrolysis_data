You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Stochastic reactor modeling of biomass pyrolysis and gasification In this paper, a partially stirred stochastic reactor model is presented as an alternative for the modeling of biomass pyrolysis and gasification. Instead of solving transport equations in all spatial dimensions as in CFD simulations, the description of state variables and mixing processes is based on a probability density function, making this approach computationally efficient. The virtual stochastic particles, an ensemble of flow elements consisting of porous solid biomass particles and surrounding gas, mimic the turbulent exchange of heat and mass in practical systems without the computationally expensive resolution of spatial dimensions. Each stochastic particle includes solid phase, pore gas and bulk gas interaction. The reactor model is coupled with a chemical mechanism for both surface and gas phase reactions. A Monte Carlo algorithm with operator splitting is employed to obtain the numerical solution. Modeling an entrained flow gasification reactor demonstrates the applicability of the model for biomass fast pyrolysis and gasification. The results are compared with published experiments and detailed CFD simulations. The stochastic reactor model is able to predict all major species in the product gas composition very well for only a fraction of the computational time as needed for comprehensive CFD.
