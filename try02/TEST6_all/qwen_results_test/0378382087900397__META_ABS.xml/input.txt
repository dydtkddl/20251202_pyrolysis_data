Effect of coal and char properties on gasification After a general review of the fate of the solids in the single steps of coal gasification processes, this contribution deals mainly with the interactions between the pyrolysis and gasification reactions on the one hand and the coal and char properties on the other. In detail it is shown, how pyrolysis conditions influence swelling or shrinking of isolated particles, relevant for fluidized bed or entrained phase reactors, and agglomeration important for fixed bed gasifiers. Pyrolysis conditions have also a strong influence on the reactivity of the resulting char - the main parameters being final temperature and residence time - as these affect quantity and quality of their internal structure and their accessibility. Moreover role and fate of mineral matter during gasification are discussed.
