A review of high-energy processing techniques applied for additive manufacturing and surface engineering of cemented carbides and cermets The review summarizes high-energy processing techniques applied for additive manufacturing and surface engineering of cemented carbides and cermets, including laser, electron, and ion beams, as well as plasma and electric discharges. The motivation for writing the review has been the fact that numerous papers have been published in these areas of science, but prospects for such studies in terms of their industrial implementations are unclear at present. In this way, the authors' goal has been to report achievements, challenges and gaps in knowledge for a more meaningful drawing of further research roadmaps. The review includes classifications of up-to-date cemented carbides and cermets in accordance with their compositions, fabrication methods, microstructure, functional properties and typical operating conditions. Then, some patterns of the evaluation of their microstructure and key characteristics are summarized. After that, achievements and challenges of laser and electron-beam additive manufacturing procedures are overviewed. Another topical section is devoted to surface engineering by both conventional methods and high-energy processing procedures. The authors have concluded that the key challenges are difficulties in simultaneous processing of both hard and binder phases without deteriorating their properties in the formed composites, as well as great residual stresses, causing the formation of cracks. To solve these issues, computer simulation methods, implemented for additive manufacturing and surface processing of metallic products, should be adapted for such composite materials. Also, a comparative economic evaluation of the return on investment in such innovative processes should be done for focusing on promising research directions.
