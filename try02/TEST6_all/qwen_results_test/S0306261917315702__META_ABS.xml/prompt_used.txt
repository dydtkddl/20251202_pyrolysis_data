You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects in steam gasification of combined biomass and plastic waste mixtures Steam gasification of combined biomass and plastics at different mass ratios of biomass to plastic was investigated in a semi-batch reactor at 1173 K and atmospheric pressure using different types of plastics. The specific plastics examined were black polycarbonate (BPC), polyethylene-terephthalate (PET), and polypropylene (PP). The chemical composition of the syngas yield evolved measured using a microGC revealed synergistic effects on the role of biomass and plastics during gasification. The observed synergy was quantified from a direct comparison of the results on cumulative gas yields from biomass-plastics mixtures as compared to the corresponding weighted aggregate results from the gasification of separate feedstock components. The results showed that the total syngas as well as H2, CO, and CO2 yields enhanced using mixtures, while the light hydrocarbon gas yields reduced in the order of PP > BPC > PET. The increase of H2 and CO with the reduction in hydrocarbon yield revealed synergistic enhancements from the secondary steam reforming reactions. TGA data from co-pyrolysis of BPC and PET with biomass revealed significant interaction while no such interaction was observed with PP. The carbon conversion and energy efficiency results showed enhancement for the BPC case. Increase in product gas yield suggests greater reformation of biomass plastic mixtures during gasification. Further studies are required to understand fundamental reaction mechanisms as well as demonstrative gasifier studies to understand both the kinetics and practical feasibility.
