You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Predictive modeling of product yields in microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic with enhanced interpretability using explainable AI approaches Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic offers a transformative approach to converting waste into valuable resources such as bio-oil, biochar, and biogas, while simultaneously addressing critical environmental challenges associated with plastic disposal. This research employs explainable AI methodologies to enhance the prediction and analysis of product yields in biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis. Advanced machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks, were utilized to model yield predictions effectively. The models were fine-tuned through hyper-parameter optimization, achieving high accuracy levels. The study emphasizes the scientific importance of integrating explainable AI with pyrolysis processes to optimize waste-to-resource recovery, contributing significantly to sustainable waste management and circular economy initiatives. Among these, the XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance, achieving R² values of 0.91 for biochar yield, 0.92 for bio-oil yield, and 0.82 for biogas yield on testing sets. To enhance model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) were utilized to assess feature importance and examine parameter influences on yield outcomes, offering valuable insights into process optimization and control. Volatile matter and fixed carbon were key predictors for biochar yield, while moisture content and pyrolysis temperature were significant for predicting bio-oil and biogas yields. This study highlights the potential of explainable AI models in advancing sustainable and efficient bio-product recovery from waste materials.
