You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Temperature field simulation of polyolefin-absorber mixture by FDTD-FDM model during microwave heating This work has performed a numerical simulation of the temperature field during microwave heating of polyolefin-absorber mixture by means of a combined electric and thermal model. A finite difference time domain was used to model the electric field distribution within the cavity, while the finite difference method was used to calculate the temperature field distribution in different reactors. This study has focused only on the process from room temperature to 500 K for reducing heating time and energy consumption. This temperature range is a process with high energy consumption, difficult to control and great influence on the follow-up reaction. Temperature dependence of dielectric properties and thermal properties of heated materials are fully considered and simulated through an iterative process. The simulation results show that input power, the size and location of the heated materials, the position of the waveguide, and the kinds of microwave absorbers are important factors affecting the heating process. As a result, the uniform temperature distribution (the temperature difference T d < 10 K) can be achieved by choosing the appropriate input power (500–2000 W), the appropriate proportion of microwave absorber (the volume ratio of SiC to HDPE is 30:70), and combining with the moving and rotating of the heated materials. The uniform temperature field obtained without mechanical stirring is very important for reducing energy consumption and subsequent reactions.
