Development of self-contained microcapsules for optimised catalyst position in self-healing materials Self-contained microcapsules for use in self-healing epoxy resin are successfully synthesized by suspension polymerization process. The microencapsulation of an epoxy resin using Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as a shell material and the location of scandium triflate (Sc(OTf)3) as the catalyst into microcapsules shell during the microencapsulation processes is presented (PMMA/Sc(OTf)3-walled microcapsules). Spherical microcapsules of 80 μm in diameter with a liquid core content of 30 wt% (determined by HPLC) are produced. Catalyst location on microcapsules are assessed qualitatively by SEM-EADS and quantitatively by TGA showing high yields (⁓70 wt%). The evaluation of the healing efficiency was assessed in terms of fracture toughness recovery. PMMA/Sc(OTf)3-walled microcapsules showed an increased healing efficiency than that of conventional PMMA-walled capsule. The healing efficiency of the PMMA-walled capsules was 46.7 and 55.1% when the system healed at 80 and 120 °C, respectively. However, in the case of PMMA/Sc(OTf)3-walled microcapsules healing efficiency increased to 57.5 and 79.1% for the same healing temperatures.
