You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in water decontamination from dyes, pharmaceuticals, and other miscellaneous nonmetallic pollutants by layered double hydroxide materials Recently, various related derivatives of layered double hydroxide (LDH) have attracted and received great interests in multidiscipline applications including environmental control via remediation and removing miscellaneous organic and inorganic contaminates from aqueous solutions and wastewater systems. The ability to synthesize LDHs by different processes and also to incorporate a variety of cations in the layers as well as the diverse interlayer anions have enhanced and motivated research works in this field. Therefore, designing and fabricating a large number of functional LDH derivatives with targeted and tunable properties for specific and selective surface applications have also increased in recent years. Therefore, this review article is dedicated to address an overview of the recently achieved efforts and progress in decontamination of dyes and pharmaceuticals as two important classes of organic pollutants with major concerns from aqueous solutions and wastewater systems. In addition, water treatment from some miscellaneous nonmetallic pollutants by LDH derivatives are also explored and surveyed. Additionally, the various dyes and pharmaceuticals pollutants, remediation techniques for removing the target pollutants were also outlined and discussed in this review. The different synthetic strategies for preparation of LDHs and their derivatives have been reviewed with strong emphasis on their structures. The surveyed dyes in this review included anionic, neutral and cationic ones, while the evaluated pharmaceuticals are mainly focused on antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other related contaminants were also covered in this review. Finally, the future developments and potential applications of LDH derivatives have been outlined and pointed out.
