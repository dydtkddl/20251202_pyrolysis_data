Recent progress in water decontamination from dyes, pharmaceuticals, and other miscellaneous nonmetallic pollutants by layered double hydroxide materials Recently, various related derivatives of layered double hydroxide (LDH) have attracted and received great interests in multidiscipline applications including environmental control via remediation and removing miscellaneous organic and inorganic contaminates from aqueous solutions and wastewater systems. The ability to synthesize LDHs by different processes and also to incorporate a variety of cations in the layers as well as the diverse interlayer anions have enhanced and motivated research works in this field. Therefore, designing and fabricating a large number of functional LDH derivatives with targeted and tunable properties for specific and selective surface applications have also increased in recent years. Therefore, this review article is dedicated to address an overview of the recently achieved efforts and progress in decontamination of dyes and pharmaceuticals as two important classes of organic pollutants with major concerns from aqueous solutions and wastewater systems. In addition, water treatment from some miscellaneous nonmetallic pollutants by LDH derivatives are also explored and surveyed. Additionally, the various dyes and pharmaceuticals pollutants, remediation techniques for removing the target pollutants were also outlined and discussed in this review. The different synthetic strategies for preparation of LDHs and their derivatives have been reviewed with strong emphasis on their structures. The surveyed dyes in this review included anionic, neutral and cationic ones, while the evaluated pharmaceuticals are mainly focused on antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other related contaminants were also covered in this review. Finally, the future developments and potential applications of LDH derivatives have been outlined and pointed out.
