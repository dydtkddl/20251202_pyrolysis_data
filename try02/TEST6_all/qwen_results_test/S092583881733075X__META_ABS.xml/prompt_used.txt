You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative oxidation behavior of Nd-Fe-B magnets for potential recycling methods: Effect of hydrogenation pre-treatment and magnet composition Recycling of Nd-Fe-B magnets is one of the few solutions to alleviate the supply risks of certain rare earth elements (REE) such as Nd and Dy. One of the most promising solutions with regards to extraction of end-of-life (EOL) magnets is to apply hydrogen decrepitation and to physically separate the Nd-Fe-B as a demagnetized hydrogenated powder. Such a powder can be directly recycled into new sintered magnets, or indirectly recycled by a conventional oxidation roasting and acid leaching flowsheet. The oxidation stability of powders, the microstructure after oxidation and the role of compositional variations can be of importance for the success of such subsequent direct or indirect recycling routes. In this study, magnets with varying compositions were subjected to different hydrogen treatments (e.g. hydrogenation, partial or full degassing and vacuum or conventional disproportionation) and subsequently studied for their comparative oxidation behavior and microstructural changes. While initial magnet composition was found to have little or no effect on oxidation behavior, the treatment type was found to have a direct impact on both the particle size distribution and the oxidation mechanism. The general oxidation rate was found to be the equally highest for hydrogenated and partially degassed samples followed by fully degassed and then disproportionated samples. After complete oxidation, complex REE-Fe-O compounds were formed more extensively in hydrogenated and fully degassed NdFeB samples than in the disproportionated samples.
