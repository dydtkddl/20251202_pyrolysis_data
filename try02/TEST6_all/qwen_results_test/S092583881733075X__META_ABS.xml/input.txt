Comparative oxidation behavior of Nd-Fe-B magnets for potential recycling methods: Effect of hydrogenation pre-treatment and magnet composition Recycling of Nd-Fe-B magnets is one of the few solutions to alleviate the supply risks of certain rare earth elements (REE) such as Nd and Dy. One of the most promising solutions with regards to extraction of end-of-life (EOL) magnets is to apply hydrogen decrepitation and to physically separate the Nd-Fe-B as a demagnetized hydrogenated powder. Such a powder can be directly recycled into new sintered magnets, or indirectly recycled by a conventional oxidation roasting and acid leaching flowsheet. The oxidation stability of powders, the microstructure after oxidation and the role of compositional variations can be of importance for the success of such subsequent direct or indirect recycling routes. In this study, magnets with varying compositions were subjected to different hydrogen treatments (e.g. hydrogenation, partial or full degassing and vacuum or conventional disproportionation) and subsequently studied for their comparative oxidation behavior and microstructural changes. While initial magnet composition was found to have little or no effect on oxidation behavior, the treatment type was found to have a direct impact on both the particle size distribution and the oxidation mechanism. The general oxidation rate was found to be the equally highest for hydrogenated and partially degassed samples followed by fully degassed and then disproportionated samples. After complete oxidation, complex REE-Fe-O compounds were formed more extensively in hydrogenated and fully degassed NdFeB samples than in the disproportionated samples.
