You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of catalyst type on recyclability and decomposition mechanism of poly(ethylene furanoate) biobased polyester In the present work, poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF) was synthesized via two-stage melt polycondensation process, using four different catalysts, namely tetrabutyl titanate (TBT), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIS), tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (TEH) and dibutyltin(IV) oxide (DBTO). In all reactions, 2,5-dimethylfuran-dicarboxylate (DMFD), ethylene glycol (EG) (1:2 molar ratio) and 400ppm of catalyst were used. The effect of these catalysts on the remelting and decomposition mechanism of PEF was studied. All polyesters were remelted up to three times, and for every melting cycle the intrinsic viscosity (IV) values and the carboxyl end group content were measured. It was found that after every melting, the IV was reduced while the COOH number was increased. Also, all samples have been studied with Fourier Transformed-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. It was found that the molecular weight reduction also affects the thermal properties of the polyesters. The decomposition mechanism of the prepared polyesters was studied using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS).
