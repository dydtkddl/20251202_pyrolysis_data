Biodegradable films made from low-density polyethylene (LDPE), rice starch and potato starch for food packaging applications: Part 1 Blends of LDPE and rice or potato starch were extruded in the presence of varying amounts of water, hot pressed and studied with regard to their mechanical properties and their gas/water permeability and biodegradability before and after storage. The presence of high starch contents ( 30%, w/w) had an adverse effect on the mechanical properties of LDPE/starch blends. Gas permeability and water vapour transmission rate increased proportionally to the starch content in the blend. Several theoretical and semiempirical calculations for mechanical properties and gas permeability were carried out and possible interpretations were provided for the occasionally observed deviations between the experimental and the theoretical values. The biodegradability rate of the blends was enhanced when the starch content exceeded 10% (w/w).
