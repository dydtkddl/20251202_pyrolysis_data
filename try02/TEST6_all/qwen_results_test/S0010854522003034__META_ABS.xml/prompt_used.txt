You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in the use of graphitic carbon nitride-based composites for the electrochemical detection of hazardous contaminants Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4 or GCN) based nanostructures have emerged as the most well-known and widely used nanomaterials and they attracted global interest due to their chemical stability, abundance, scalable synthesis, cost-effectiveness, and biocompatibility. The tailorable properties of GCN largely depend on the various surface morphologies of nanostructured GCN, which are further dependent upon the type of utilized synthesis approach. The abundance of functional amine groups, surface area, flexibility in designing various nanostructures, active sites, and exceptional properties have inspired the use of GCN nanostructures as emerging sensing platforms for the electrochemical detection of hazardous contaminants. Although many review articles have been reported on the synthesis and applications of GCN-based materials, the comprehensive study of recent research developments and significant analysis of GCN-based sensing materials for the detection of hazardous contaminants using electrochemical devices have not been fully explored. Hence, in this review, we systematically analyzed and comprehensively reviewed the recent research developments of GCN-based composites for the electrochemical detection of hazardous contaminants such as drugs, phenolic compounds, heavy metal ions, nitrites, and pesticides. Immobilization methods, modification strategies, advantages and disadvantages of GCN composites for the electrochemical detection of hazardous contaminants were explicitly elucidated. Significantly, this review emphasizes the potential of GCN-based sensing materials for the on-site electrochemical detection of hazardous contaminants. Furthermore, advantages of the on-site electrochemical sensing strategies and portable devices were provided. Viewpoints on the critical challenges and future perspectives were provided for the GCN in electrochemical sensing strategies based on recent research developments and our experimental expertise. It is anticipated that the current work will pave the way for providing fruitful future insights for the researchers working on the design and development of various electrochemical sensors and promote their growth in various fields of science and technology.
