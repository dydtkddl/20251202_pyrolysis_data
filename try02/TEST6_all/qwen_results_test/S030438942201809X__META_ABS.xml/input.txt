Functionalized reactive polymers for the removal of chemical warfare agents: A review Protection from and removal of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) from the environment remains a global goal. Activated charcoal, metal oxides, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), polyoxometalates (POMs) and reactive polymers have all been investigated for CWA removal. Composite polymeric materials are rapidly gaining traction as versatile building blocks for personal protective equipment (PPE) and catalytic devices. Polymers are inexpensive to produce and easily engineered into a wide range of materials including films, electro-spun fibers, mixed-matrix membranes/reactors, and other forms. When containing reactive side-chains, hydrolysis catalysts, and/or oxidative catalysts polymeric devices are primed for CWA decontamination. In this review, recent advances in reactive polymeric materials for CWA removal are summarized. To aid in comparing the effectiveness of the different solid catalysts, particular attention is paid to the stoichiometric ratio of reactive species to toxic substrate (CWA or CWA simulant).
