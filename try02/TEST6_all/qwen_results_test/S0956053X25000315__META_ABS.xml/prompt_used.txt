You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste artificial marble pyrolysis and hydrolysis Artificial marble, a composite material consisting of 40 % (g g−1) Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and 60 % (g g−1) aluminium hydroxide Al(OH)3 , combines the durability and aesthetics of real marble with the lightweight and moldability of plastic. It is the most sought-after synthetic stone in the world, with a production volume of over 1 million t in 2021. However, due to a high level of cross-linking, mechanical recycling of the composite is impossible, while chemical recycling is achievable, yet unprofitable. The only economically viable recycling solution is to retain the value of both the organic and inorganic fraction of the composite. We investigated the pyrolysis and hydrolysis of post-consumer end-of-life artificial marble to identify possible valorization routes, examining the effects of temperature, water content, catalyst presence, and heating style. Temperature directly accelerates thermolysis, and indirectly hydrolysis. The water inherently present in Al(OH)3 drives initial hydrolysis, and temperature expedites inorganic fraction dehydration, increasing local water partial pressure near polymer ester sites. Above 350°C, PMMAeq depolymerizes faster than it hydrolyzes, balancing the effects of temperature on water dehydration with the depletion of available ester sites for hydrolysis. Contrary to intuition, PMMA does not depolymerize to its monomer MMA and then hydrolyze its acid (methacrylic acid); instead, PMMA partially hydrolyzes to poly methacrylic acid (PMAA) while also depolymerizing to MMA. PMAA then dehydrates and degrades, releasing CO and CO2. The optimal method involves a heating ramp that first releases water at 300°C, minimizing hydrolysis, and then favors MMA production at 400°C, achieving a 66 % (g g−1) MMA yield. Regardless of the operative conditions, the inorganic fraction transforms from Al(OH)3 to a γ -alumina precursor, boehmite. Additionally, the remaining polymer in the residue, about 9 % (g g−1), has the required heat capacity for an energy-self sufficient calcination to γ -alumina. This dual-phase process not only maximizes MMA recovery but also retains the value of the inorganic fraction, providing a sustainable and economically viable recycling method for artificial marble.
