You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Accessibility of adsorption sites for superfine powdered activated carbons incorporated into electrospun polystyrene fibers Superfine powdered activated carbon (SPAC) is sub-micron sized activated carbon with superior adsorption kinetics compared to regular powdered activated carbon (PAC) due to the short intraparticle diffusion times. SPAC has recently been demonstrated as an excellent adsorbent; however, subsequent removal of spent SPAC in suspended reactors may be challenging due to its fine size. Thus, SPAC may benefit from immobilization into a macroscopic scaffolding if its adsorptive properties can be preserved. Composition of non-woven electrospun polystyrene (PS) fibers consisting of SPAC is a novel approach to immobilize SPAC; however, the potential losses of adsorption capacity due to polymer-SPAC interactions is still mostly unknown. In this study, SPAC-laden electrospun PS with intentionally tuned SPAC sizes were fabricated for the first time. The centrifugal separation of SPAC generated two different particle sizes with median diameters of 0.30 ± 0.15 µm (SPAC-Fine) and 0.62 ± 0.25 µm (SPAC-Coarse). Both SPAC-Fine and SPAC-Coarse were added to the spinning solution and compared against the PS-only control fibers. Phenanthrene was used as a probe molecule to investigate the accessibility of adsorption sites on PS/SPAC composite fibers. This study showed that most SPAC adsorption sites are still accessible when incorporated into electrospun polymer fibers, regardless of whether the carbon particle size is larger or smaller than the fiber diameter. It can be speculated that the disposition of fine particles on the external surface of PS fibers as well as partial incorporation of large SPAC particles in the fiber allow diffusion of probe molecules onto the ultimate sorption sites of SPAC particles.
