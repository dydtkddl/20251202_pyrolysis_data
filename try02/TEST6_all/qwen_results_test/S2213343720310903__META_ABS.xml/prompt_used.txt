You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Justification of the possibility of car tires recycling as part of coal-water composites The results of experimental studies of ignition processes of multi-component fuel droplets based on coal, water and synthetic oil (synthetic-oil (SO)): water/coal/synthesis-oil (WCF-Oil) are presented. The liquid fuel component (SO) of the fuel is obtained by steam gasification of crushed rubber of used car tires. Integral characteristics of the ignition process of three-component fuel particles under high-temperature heating conditions were established during experimental studies. High prospects of tires utilization unsuitable for further use by pyrolysis and combustion of thermal decomposition products in the composition of coal-water fuel are shown. It was found that addition of liquid rubber pyrolysis products to the structure of coal-water slurry leads to a significant acceleration of the ignition processes. A detailed analysis of the video footage showed that ignition process of fuel particles proceeds, as a rule, in several stages. In this case, ignition occurs in the gas phase. New (significantly different from the known) mathematical model of the ignition process of significantly inhomogeneous multicomponent fuel has been formulated based on the results of experiments. The model describes the processes of heat and mass transfer that occur together under conditions of intensive phase and thermochemical transformations in a small neighborhood and in the pore structure of the fuel particle. The mathematical model was verified by a comparative analysis of the results of numerical modeling with experiment. A good correspondence between the theoretical and experimental values of the ignition delay times of fuel particles has been established.
