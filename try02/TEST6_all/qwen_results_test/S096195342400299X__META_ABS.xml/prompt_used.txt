You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance evaluation of different nitrogenous biomass pyrolysis chars: Physicochemical properties and ibuprofen adsorption The preparation of high-performance porous carbons (HPPCs) using biomass as adsorbent is a viable strategy for the treatment of ibuprofen (IB) in water. In the present study, pyrolyzed carbon was prepared from duckweed (DW) and rice straw (SW) at 400, 500, and 600 °C, and subsequently mixed pyrolysis with KOH to prepare the HPPCs. The HPPCs were used for the treatment of ibuprofen (IB) in water to evaluate their absorption performance. The physicochemical properties of biochar and HPPCs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray electron microscopy, Raman microscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Taylor method. In IB adsorption experiments, adsorption equilibrium was evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacities of DW and SW were 0.952 and 0484 g/g, respectively, at an IB concentration of 0.5 g/L. The adsorption capacity of HPPCs for IB is influenced by a multifactorial combination of the specific surface area, nitrogen content, and nitrogen-containing functional groups on the surface. Generally, the HPPCs showed great potential for the removal of the IB pharmaceutical contaminants from aqueous solutions.
