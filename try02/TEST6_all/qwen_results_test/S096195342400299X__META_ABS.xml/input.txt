Performance evaluation of different nitrogenous biomass pyrolysis chars: Physicochemical properties and ibuprofen adsorption The preparation of high-performance porous carbons (HPPCs) using biomass as adsorbent is a viable strategy for the treatment of ibuprofen (IB) in water. In the present study, pyrolyzed carbon was prepared from duckweed (DW) and rice straw (SW) at 400, 500, and 600 °C, and subsequently mixed pyrolysis with KOH to prepare the HPPCs. The HPPCs were used for the treatment of ibuprofen (IB) in water to evaluate their absorption performance. The physicochemical properties of biochar and HPPCs were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray electron microscopy, Raman microscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Taylor method. In IB adsorption experiments, adsorption equilibrium was evaluated using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacities of DW and SW were 0.952 and 0484 g/g, respectively, at an IB concentration of 0.5 g/L. The adsorption capacity of HPPCs for IB is influenced by a multifactorial combination of the specific surface area, nitrogen content, and nitrogen-containing functional groups on the surface. Generally, the HPPCs showed great potential for the removal of the IB pharmaceutical contaminants from aqueous solutions.
