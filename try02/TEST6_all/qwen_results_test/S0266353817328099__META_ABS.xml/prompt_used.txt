You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced thermal and fire retardancy properties of polypropylene reinforced with a hybrid graphene/glass-fibre filler The thermal stability and flame retardancy properties of polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites containing graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), glass fibres (GFs) or a hybrid mixture of the two fillers were investigated. The GNPs enhanced the thermal stability of the nanocomposites by at least 48 °C as a result of the nanoconfinement of the polypropylene chains and the prevention of the emission of the gaseous molecules during decomposition. Pyrolysis combined with gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy showed that the decomposition mechanism of the polymer was not altered by the presence of the nanofillers and the alkenes that comprised of 3n carbon atoms were the main degradation products. Cone calorimetry tests revealed a significant delay of the ignition under irradiation with the addition of GNPs to the PP. Furthermore, the GNPs lowered the combustion rate of the PP due to the formation of a carbonaceous protective layer that acted as a barrier to heat and mass transfer. The lightweight materials prepared show promising results for applications where high thermal stability along with fire retardancy are a prerequisite, such as parts for vehicles or aircraft.
