You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of CO2 splitting in a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge by pressure increase, packed bed and catalyst addition CO2 splitting in a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is demonstrated. Empty as well as packed bed reactors with and without cerium oxide as a catalyst are investigated, but despite most other studies, the DBDs are operated also above atmospheric pressure, up to 2 bar. Argon is admixed since it reduces the breakdown voltage and thus, enables plasma operation at the elevated pressure with still moderate high voltage amplitudes of up to 13.5 kVpp. A detailed electrical characterisation of the discharge is correlated with the plasma-chemical CO2 dissociation. In particular, the discharge power, discharge voltage, minimum sustaining voltage as well as the cell and effective barrier capacites are determined as a function of pressure and gas composition. In combination with an equivalent circuit model the electrode area covered by the plasma is elucidated. Increasing the pressure requires a higher minimum sustaining voltage amplitude, but the optimum of power input for each given voltage amplitude depends on pressure and gas composion. Increasing the pressure from 1 to 2 bar enhances the CO2 conversion from 3.4 % to 8.9 % for nearly the same specific energy input (0.35 and 0.31 eV/particle) in the empty reactor and to 12.7 % with a packed bed in the discharge space. The energy efficiency increase from 6 % to 20 % is explained by a higher number of collisions between CO2 molecules and active plasma species leading to dissociation. Moreover, reactor performance can be effectively increased by adding glass spheres coated with ceria (CeO2).
