Synthesis of green fluorescent carbon quantum dots using waste polyolefins residue for Cu2+ ion sensing and live cell imaging The residue obtained from the pyrolysis of waste polyolefins, has been used for preparation of highly green-visual fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) by a simple one step hydrothermal approach consisting of ultrasonic-assisted chemical oxidation. These CQDs were characterized by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, and FTIR. The CQDs possessed high stability in aqueous solution and exhibited strong fluorescence with quantum yield of 4.84%. The use of these CQDs as a fluorescent sensor for Cu2+ ions detection has been explored. The synthesized CQDs have excellent selectivity and sensitivity towards Cu2+ ions with a limit of detection (LOD) 6.33nM and linear detection range of 1–8.0μM. These CQDs have also shown their utility for analysis of real water samples and have the potential to use for triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 468 cells) imaging.
