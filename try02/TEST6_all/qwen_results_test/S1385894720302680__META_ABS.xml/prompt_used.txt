You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification of plastic wastes and soda lignin in supercritical water In this study, the co-gasification of soda lignin produced from black liquor and various plastics in supercritical water was investigated experimentally. The effect of the mixing ratio of soda lignin/PE, temperature, reaction time, total concentration and plastic types was studied. A synergetic effect was found in co-gasification of PE and soda lignin, and the maximum influence was obtained at a mixing ratio of 50:50. Increasing the temperature and reaction time, and reducing the concentration improved the gasification efficiency and hydrogen production from co-gasification of PE/soda lignin (50:50). The H2 yield increased over 5 times to 57.0 mol/kg with temperature increasing from 500 °C to 750 °C, and the highest H2 yield of 63.3 mol/kg was obtained at 700 °C when the concentration was reduced to 5 wt%. The gasification efficiencies of different plastics were distinct and the order is: PE > PC ≈ PP > ABS, and the addition of soda lignin improved all the gasification efficiencies. The alkali salts in soda lignin also catalyzed the reforming of CH4 and C2H6 that generated from the depolymerization of plastics, especially PE and PP and improved the hydrogen production.
