You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of the effects of Pr1-xCexCoO3/dolomite catalyst on energy saving and carbon reduction in biomass gasification for the production of hydrogen-rich syngas Biomass is considered a renewable green coal, and its clean and efficient utilization is of great significance for energy conservation and carbon reduction. One of the most critical aspects of biomass gasification is the selection of an appropriate catalyst. In this study, we synthesized a catalyst with 10 % Pr1-xCexCoO3 supported on dolomite using the sol-gel method. We conducted graded internal circulation gasification experiments to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. The effects of element substitution in PrCoO3, temperature, catalyst composition, and steam injection rate on the products were investigated. The optimal gasification conditions were determined through response surface regression analysis. The data indicate that this catalyst can improve gasification efficiency, with Pr0.4Ce0.6CoO3/Dol showing the best catalytic performance. It effectively reduces the required gasification temperature and steam amount, decreases CO2 production, and increases CO and H2 yields. The catalyst accelerates the cleavage and ring-opening reactions of hydrocarbons, leading to terminal chain hydroxylation, followed by the dehydration-condensation of methyl groups into ethers. As the temperature rises, the rate of carboxyl group removal gradually exceeds the rate of carboxyl group formation via the oxidation of hydroxyl and ether chains, resulting in an initial increase and then a decrease in the number of carboxyl groups. Under optimal gasification conditions, CO2 production is reduced by one-fourth compared to using a dolomite catalyst.
