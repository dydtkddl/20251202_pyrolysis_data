Analysis of the effects of Pr1-xCexCoO3/dolomite catalyst on energy saving and carbon reduction in biomass gasification for the production of hydrogen-rich syngas Biomass is considered a renewable green coal, and its clean and efficient utilization is of great significance for energy conservation and carbon reduction. One of the most critical aspects of biomass gasification is the selection of an appropriate catalyst. In this study, we synthesized a catalyst with 10 % Pr1-xCexCoO3 supported on dolomite using the sol-gel method. We conducted graded internal circulation gasification experiments to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. The effects of element substitution in PrCoO3, temperature, catalyst composition, and steam injection rate on the products were investigated. The optimal gasification conditions were determined through response surface regression analysis. The data indicate that this catalyst can improve gasification efficiency, with Pr0.4Ce0.6CoO3/Dol showing the best catalytic performance. It effectively reduces the required gasification temperature and steam amount, decreases CO2 production, and increases CO and H2 yields. The catalyst accelerates the cleavage and ring-opening reactions of hydrocarbons, leading to terminal chain hydroxylation, followed by the dehydration-condensation of methyl groups into ethers. As the temperature rises, the rate of carboxyl group removal gradually exceeds the rate of carboxyl group formation via the oxidation of hydroxyl and ether chains, resulting in an initial increase and then a decrease in the number of carboxyl groups. Under optimal gasification conditions, CO2 production is reduced by one-fourth compared to using a dolomite catalyst.
