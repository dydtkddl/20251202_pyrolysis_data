You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Active sites engineered biomass-carbon as a catalyst for biodiesel production: Process optimization using RSM and life cycle assessment Herein, we aimed at the production of porous biochar by simultaneous activation-graphitization. The active sites engineered biochar catalyst was functionalized using 4-DBS, which possessed a high surface area, and sulfur content of 1196.13 m2 g−1 and 1.9 mmol g−1, respectively. We extensively analyzed the catalyst using various techniques such as XRD, FTIR, TGA, NH3-TPD, SEM-EDS, TEM, BET, and XPS. We used this catalyst to optimize Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) transesterification, achieving a 97.1 ± 0.4% yield with the RSM-CCD method. Kinetic studies showed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and thermodynamics indicated an endothermic, nonspontaneous process.. A life cycle assessment was conducted to assess the environmental impacts of producing biodiesel from JCO, using 1 kg of biodiesel as the reference unit. The findings revealed that the total abiotic depletion of fossil resources throughout the entire biodiesel production process amounted to 52.1 MJ, the global warming potential was equivalent to 3.17 kg of CO2 emissions, the acidification potential was comparable to 0.027 kg of SO2 emissions, and the eutrophication potential was 0.016 kg of PO4 3− , human toxicity level 1.89 kg 1,4-DP eq and freshwater ecotoxicity to kg 1,4-DP equivalent for every 1 kg of biodiesel manufactured. The estimated cost of biodiesel produced was 1.3 USD ($) per kg, which mainly attributed to the high reusability of catalyst (82.5 ± 0.4% yield in 7th cycle), indicating high commercial applicability. Finally, the study proposes future recommendations based on identified gaps in the literature through innovative bibliometric analysis.
