You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization using Box-Behnken design of biodiesel synthesis: Microwave-assisted transesterification of coconut oil with isopropyl alcohol using K2O/γ-Al2O3 catalyst The production of isopropyl ester (biodiesel) from coconut oil using a K2O/γ-Al2O3 catalyst derived from alum, combined with microwave-assisted transesterification, demonstrates strong potential for enhancing biodiesel production efficiency. This study aimed to optimize reaction parameters and evaluate the kinetic behavior, product composition, and physicochemical properties of the resulting biodiesel. Reaction temperature (60–80 °C), catalyst concentration (1–5 wt.%), and reaction time (5–30 min) were selected as independent variables, with ester yield as the response. Kinetic analysis showed that the transesterification reaction followed a second-order model with an activation energy of 21.26 kJ/mol, facilitated by microwave-induced molecular collisions. Optimization using the Box-Behnken design (BBD) identified optimal conditions at 68.48 °C, 3.22 wt% catalyst, and 20.96 min, achieving a maximum yield of 70.50 wt%. GC-FID analysis confirmed isopropyl laurate (39.47 wt%) as the major component. The produced biodiesel exhibited favorable fuel properties: a cetane number of 62.4, flash point of 164 °C, viscosity of 4.59 mm2/s, density of 878 kg/m3, and cloud and pour points of 11 °C and 8 °C, respectively. These properties meet ASTM D6751 and Indonesian National Standard (SNI 7182:2015), supporting its applicability as a high-quality, renewable diesel fuel. This study underscores the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous catalysis with microwave technology for sustainable biodiesel production.
