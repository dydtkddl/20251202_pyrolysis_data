Synthesis and properties of biodegradable PBAT prepared from PBT chemically recycled resources The production of synthetic polymer materials has engendered substantial environmental hazards stemming from waste generation. Employing chemical recycling methods constitutes a viable approach for attaining sustained recycling of synthetic raw materials. In the present study, bishydroxybutyl terephthalate (BHBT), a precursor for the synthesis of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), was created by chemically alcoholyzing polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). Further, bis(4-hydroxybutyl) adipate (BHAT), which was produced via esterification with adipic acid (AA) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO), and BHBT condensation polymerization were combined to create biodegradable PBAT. Additionally, the effects of the recycled BHBT and BHAT segment ratio on the structures and properties of biodegradable PBAT were investigated. The results indicate that the synthesis of repolymerized PBAT was accomplished successfully. As the proportion of butylene terephthalate (BT) segments increased, several notable improvements were observed: an increase in melting temperature, enhanced thermal stability, elevated tensile strength, and a reduction in the rate of biodegradation. The melting point was 139.51 °C, the tensile strength was 22.62 MPa, and the 30-day biodegradation rate was 23.32 % when the percentage of BT segments was 60 %. In the present study, a method for producing biodegradable polyesters through the process of alcoholysis and repolymerization of recalcitrant polyester waste was proposed. It provides a new solution for the efficient recycling of waste polymer materials.
