You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and properties of biodegradable PBAT prepared from PBT chemically recycled resources The production of synthetic polymer materials has engendered substantial environmental hazards stemming from waste generation. Employing chemical recycling methods constitutes a viable approach for attaining sustained recycling of synthetic raw materials. In the present study, bishydroxybutyl terephthalate (BHBT), a precursor for the synthesis of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), was created by chemically alcoholyzing polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). Further, bis(4-hydroxybutyl) adipate (BHAT), which was produced via esterification with adipic acid (AA) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO), and BHBT condensation polymerization were combined to create biodegradable PBAT. Additionally, the effects of the recycled BHBT and BHAT segment ratio on the structures and properties of biodegradable PBAT were investigated. The results indicate that the synthesis of repolymerized PBAT was accomplished successfully. As the proportion of butylene terephthalate (BT) segments increased, several notable improvements were observed: an increase in melting temperature, enhanced thermal stability, elevated tensile strength, and a reduction in the rate of biodegradation. The melting point was 139.51 °C, the tensile strength was 22.62 MPa, and the 30-day biodegradation rate was 23.32 % when the percentage of BT segments was 60 %. In the present study, a method for producing biodegradable polyesters through the process of alcoholysis and repolymerization of recalcitrant polyester waste was proposed. It provides a new solution for the efficient recycling of waste polymer materials.
