You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formulation and assessment of flamelet-generated manifolds for reacting interfaces The coupling of heat and mass transfer at the surface of solid or liquid fuels is important when modeling near-surface gasification and combustion processes. Modeling the reacting boundary layer with the use of finite-rate chemistry allows for a highly accurate description of the coupling between the flame and fuel surface, but is not tractable when considering detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. In this study, simplified unsteady 1D flames with mass blowing are considered for a solid biomass fuel where the flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) method is employed as a model reduction strategy for potential application to multidimensional calculations, such as flame spread over solid materials undergoing pyrolysis and ablation. Two types of FGM are considered. The first are a set of steady-state flames differentiated by their scalar dissipation rate. Steady flamelets have been used extensively in the past for jets, shear-layers, etc. but, their application to solid fuel boundaries is new. Results show that the use of steady flames produce unacceptable errors, with temperature errors in excess of 45%. To avoid these errors, a new methodology for developing an unsteady FGM is presented that accounts for unsteady diffusion effects but, is also independent of surface mass flux. Results using the unsteady FGM greatly reduces errors in temperature with differences that are under 10%.
