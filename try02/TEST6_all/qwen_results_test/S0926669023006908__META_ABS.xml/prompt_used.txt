You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of cellulose over alkali and alkaline earth metal salts for levoglucosan production A comprehensive study of alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) salts including two different anions (Cl- and CH3COO-) in the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose to produce levoglucosan (LG), bio-oil, and biochar were investigated. At the same time, the catalytic pyrolysis mechanism was also speculated. The thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and lab-scale fixed-bed reactor system were used to determine the thermal degradation process and the pyrolysis products of LG, bio-oil, and biochar. The optimized pyrolysis parameters were obtained by using Box-Behnken design-response surface method. According to the results, AAEM salts significantly boosted the yield of biochar, as well as greatly cut down the output of LG and bio-oil. The rank of effect on LG yield was as follows: CaCl2, MgCl2 > CH3COOK, CH3COONa > (CH3COO)2Mg, (CH3COO)2Ca > KCl, NaCl. Moreover, the addition of AAEM salts considerably dropped the activation energy E of cellulose pyrolysis as well as prompted microcrystalline cellulose pyrolysis under lower temperatures. This study was pivotal in deducing the pathway of cellulose pyrolysis, thereby offering critical insights to hasten the progress of biomass utilization.
