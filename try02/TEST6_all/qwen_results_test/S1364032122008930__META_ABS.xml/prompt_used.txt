You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Current status and future prospects of biofuel production from brown algae in North America: Progress and challenges Brown algae adsorb a considerable amount of CO2 and store carbon in their biomass more than many other algae species. Nowadays, depletion of fossil fuel resources, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, and the future of human food security have encouraged scientists and policymakers to develop safer and more sustainable alternatives of energy sources. Brown algae have attracted most of this attention in North American countries to generate a wide range of products and biomass for biorefinery. In this review paper, various aspects of brown algae cultivation and its biorefinery process are discussed. Main drivers of the sectors, opportunities, challenges, and future prospects of brown algae-based biofuels in North America have been taken into account; the most appropriate processes and pathways are compared to maximize the outputs and environmental benefits, and minimize costs and drawbacks of the industry. Analysis and predictions of renewable energy future in North American countries revealed that biomass-derived fuels, including brown algae biofuels, will play an important role especially in the transportation sector. These biofuels, including bioethanol and biodiesel are accompanied by various co-products and by-products in an optimized biorefinery system to convert every available component of brown algae. However, cultivation of brown algae to produce biomass at a commercial scale with minimum costs and market demands are the main challenges of algal biofuels. Finally, expanding the value chain of the brown algae biorefinery by producing more advanced biofuels such as aviation fuels and value-added co- and by-products would significantly impact North American countries' gross domestic product.
