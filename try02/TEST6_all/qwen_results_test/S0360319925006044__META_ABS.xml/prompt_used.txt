You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The mechanism for enhancing the hydrogen production yield from corn straw through the synthesis of deep eutectic solvents with [Emim][OAc] and 1,4-butanediol To enhance the yield of biohydrogen production from corn straw, a methodology involving the synthesis of deep eutectic solvent (DES) using hydrogen bond acceptor [Emim][OAc] and hydrogen bond donor 1,4-butanediol and its application in the pretreatment was investigated. DES was prepared by mixing [Emim][OAc] and 1,4-butanediol solution with a concentration of 70% at a ratio of 4.7:100 (g:mL), followed by heating and stirring at 60 °C for 30 min. The optimal conditions for DES pretreatment were as follows: the liquid-solid ratio of the volume of DES to the mass of corn straw was 50:1 (mL:g), and the reaction temperature and reaction time were 121 °C and 1 h, respectively. The hydrogen yield was approximately 138.3 mL/g of corn straw. The comprehensive analysis outcomes derived from chemical analysis, FT-IR, 13C NMR, XRD, TGA, and BET demonstrated that the hydrogen bonds within lignocellulose, the ester bonds between hemicellulose and lignin, the β-1,4 glycosidic bonds of cellulose and hemicellulose, and the β-O-4 bonds of lignin were disrupted, leading to the elimination of 86.79% of hemicellulose and 74.69% of lignin, thereby increasing the yield of hydrogen production from corn straw by 591.5%. The pretreatment efficacy of DES prepared from the fourth recycled [Emim][OAc] on corn straw did not deteriorate conspicuously. This study can offer a theoretical foundation for efficient hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass pretreated by DES.
