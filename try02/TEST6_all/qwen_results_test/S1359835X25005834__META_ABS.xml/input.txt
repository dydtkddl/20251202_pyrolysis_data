Review of boron nitride based polymer composites with ultrahigh thermal conductivity: Critical strategies and applications The rapid advancement of emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and third-generation semiconductors, has driven a surge in demand for efficient thermal management in high-power-density electronic systems. Polymer-based thermally conductive composites integrate the flexibility and processability of polymers with high thermal conductivity (TC) of inorganic fillers, making them promising candidates for electronic packaging, energy storage, and communication devices. Among various fillers, hexagonal boron nitride (BN), which possesses high in-plane TC coupled with electrically insulating properties, has attracted increasing attention. However, achieving ultrahigh out-of-plane TC in BN/polymer composites remains one of the key challenges. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of the past five years in realizing ultrahigh out-of-plane TC, with a particular focus on two enhancement strategies: scalable preparation of large-sized BN nanosheets and regulation of filler morphologies and orientation structures, including comparative analyses of various methods. By employing high filler loadings, alignment techniques and interface engineering, the out-of-plane TC of these composites has been increased from conventional TC below 5 W m−1 K−1 to approximately 50 W m−1 K−1. In addition, potential applications and future perspectives of BN/polymer composites are also briefly outlined. This review aims to provide valuable insights for the large-scale fabrication and applications of high-performance thermally conductive BN/polymer composites.
