You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of boron nitride based polymer composites with ultrahigh thermal conductivity: Critical strategies and applications The rapid advancement of emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and third-generation semiconductors, has driven a surge in demand for efficient thermal management in high-power-density electronic systems. Polymer-based thermally conductive composites integrate the flexibility and processability of polymers with high thermal conductivity (TC) of inorganic fillers, making them promising candidates for electronic packaging, energy storage, and communication devices. Among various fillers, hexagonal boron nitride (BN), which possesses high in-plane TC coupled with electrically insulating properties, has attracted increasing attention. However, achieving ultrahigh out-of-plane TC in BN/polymer composites remains one of the key challenges. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of the past five years in realizing ultrahigh out-of-plane TC, with a particular focus on two enhancement strategies: scalable preparation of large-sized BN nanosheets and regulation of filler morphologies and orientation structures, including comparative analyses of various methods. By employing high filler loadings, alignment techniques and interface engineering, the out-of-plane TC of these composites has been increased from conventional TC below 5 W m−1 K−1 to approximately 50 W m−1 K−1. In addition, potential applications and future perspectives of BN/polymer composites are also briefly outlined. This review aims to provide valuable insights for the large-scale fabrication and applications of high-performance thermally conductive BN/polymer composites.
