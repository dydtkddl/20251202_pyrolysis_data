You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Harnessing interfacial electronic functionalization for acid-resistant carbon encapsulated platinum catalysts The direct hydrogenation/Bamberger rearrangement of nitrobenzene to para-aminophenol (PAP) offers an efficient and sustainable strategy for upgrading bulk chemical feedstocks into value-added fine chemicals. However, the harsh acidic environment required for this transformation often leads to metal leaching, presenting a major challenge for catalyst design. Here, we report a highly efficient core–shell catalyst (Pt/Al2O3@PIC), in which platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are fully encapsulated by nitrogen-doped graphene layers derived from the pyrolysis of a pyromellitic dianhydride/4,4′-oxydianiline-based polyimide (PI). By tuning the defect density of the carbon shell, catalysts with enhanced electron conductivity and structural integrity were achieved. The optimized catalyst delivers complete conversion of nitrobenzene and achieves PAP selectivity of up to 80 %, while exhibiting outstanding stability over 20 repeated cycles in acidic media. Crucially, by adjusting the precursor ratios and carbonization conditions, the interfacial interaction between the graphene shell and the metal core was reinforced, thereby enhancing electron transport and modulating the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. Combined characterization and DFT calculations reveal that the strong Pt–pyridinic nitrogen interaction enriches the electron density along the Pt–N–C interface, which not only facilitates hydrogen activation but also promotes intermediate phenylhydroxylamine desorption, thereby enabling both high activity and high selectivity. This study provides a generalizable strategy and mechanistic insight for the development of acid-resistant heterogeneous catalysts.
