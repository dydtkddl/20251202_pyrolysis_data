Harnessing interfacial electronic functionalization for acid-resistant carbon encapsulated platinum catalysts The direct hydrogenation/Bamberger rearrangement of nitrobenzene to para-aminophenol (PAP) offers an efficient and sustainable strategy for upgrading bulk chemical feedstocks into value-added fine chemicals. However, the harsh acidic environment required for this transformation often leads to metal leaching, presenting a major challenge for catalyst design. Here, we report a highly efficient core–shell catalyst (Pt/Al2O3@PIC), in which platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are fully encapsulated by nitrogen-doped graphene layers derived from the pyrolysis of a pyromellitic dianhydride/4,4′-oxydianiline-based polyimide (PI). By tuning the defect density of the carbon shell, catalysts with enhanced electron conductivity and structural integrity were achieved. The optimized catalyst delivers complete conversion of nitrobenzene and achieves PAP selectivity of up to 80 %, while exhibiting outstanding stability over 20 repeated cycles in acidic media. Crucially, by adjusting the precursor ratios and carbonization conditions, the interfacial interaction between the graphene shell and the metal core was reinforced, thereby enhancing electron transport and modulating the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. Combined characterization and DFT calculations reveal that the strong Pt–pyridinic nitrogen interaction enriches the electron density along the Pt–N–C interface, which not only facilitates hydrogen activation but also promotes intermediate phenylhydroxylamine desorption, thereby enabling both high activity and high selectivity. This study provides a generalizable strategy and mechanistic insight for the development of acid-resistant heterogeneous catalysts.
