You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing catalytic performance for waste plastic upgrading: Simultaneous regulation of pore structure and acid sites in Ga-doped desilicated HZSM-5 catalysts Though catalytic pyrolysis through HZSM-5 has shown great potential to convert waste plastics, it is urgent to modify the catalyst to improve its catalytic performance due to the low liquid product yields and inferior selectivity to high value-added monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). During the study, two main modification methods, desilication via alkali treatment and Ga metal doping, were applied on HZSM-5 to reach simultaneous regulation of pore structure and acid site. It showed that selectivity to MAHs rose from 45.37 % to 58.45 % and 59.54 %, respectively, when 0.1 M and 0.4 M NaOH solutions were used for desilication. After Ga metal doping, selectivity to MAHs further increased to 67.43 % and 67.16 %, respectively, at A 0.1 M 5 %Ga/ZSM-5 and A 0.4 M 5 %Ga/ZSM-5, with selectivity to value-added benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) rising to 50.86 % and 46.45 % correspondingly. After three times of recycling, the catalyst still remained active with selectivity to MAHs staying above 65 %.
