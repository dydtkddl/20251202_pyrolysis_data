You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polyhydroxybutyrate production from dark-fermentative effluent and composite grafting with bagasse derived α-cellulose in a biorefinery approach The study evaluated the preparation of a biocomposite using waste-derived polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and bagasse cellulose (α-cellulose) in a biorefinery approach. PHB was produced using dark fermentation effluent rich in volatile fatty acids (VFA) derived from vegetable waste and α-cellulose was extracted from sugarcane bagasse (SCB). Nutrient limitation induced microbial PHB accumulation, wherein maximum production of 0.28 ± 0.06 g PHB/g DCW (28%) was observed. Confocal examination showed the deposition of PHB granules in the cell cytoplasm and NMR spectrum exhibited a structural correlation. α-Cellulose (0.22 ± 0.02 g α-cellulose/g SCB) was extracted through SCB pretreatment. Thereafter, grafting α-cellulose with PHB offered intermolecular bonding, which resulted in enhanced thermal stability of the biocomposite than corresponding pristine PHB. FE-SEM morphological examination of biocomposite depicted that α-cellulose functioned as a filler to PHB. XRD profiles showed significant decrement in PHB crystallinity, signifying the functional role of α-cellulose as an effective reinforcing agent. Additionally, ether functional group of α-cellulose and ester group of PHB also appeared in XPS analysis of the composite, thus authorizing the effective blending of α-cellulose and PHB. Utilization of bagasse-derived cellulose for strengthening biologically produced PHB expands its applications, while simultaneously addressing the plastic pollution issues. Additional value from this process was further achieved by incorporating the concept of biorefinery, wherein acidogenic fermentation effluents were used for the production of PHA, which enabled the re-entry of products (VFA) to the production cycle, thus achieving circularity.
