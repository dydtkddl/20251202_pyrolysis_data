You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of MCM-22/ZSM-5 core–shell structured zeolite for catalytic cracking of polyethylene to selectively produce paraxylene The core–shell structured MCM-22/ZSM-5 zeolite (MZCS50) was synthesized through a combination of hydrothermal crystallization (to form the MCM-22 core) and steam-assisted crystallization (to form the ZSM-5 shell). The MCM-22 core exhibited lamellar cake-like shape with a diameter of 3 ∼ 4 µm, while the ZSM-5 shell consisted of aggregated nanoparticles. MZCS50 possessed a high specific surface area, a micropore-mesopore coexisting structure, and was Brønsted acid-dominant material. MZCS50 was used as a catalyst for the cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to produce BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes). The results showed that 550 °C was the optimal temperature for LDPE cracking. The maximum liquid yield achieved was 23.4 %, with selectivities to BTEX, xylenes and p-xylene of 79.8 %, 43.2 %, and 21.3 %, respectively. Repeated cracking experiments demonstrated that MZCS50 exhibited good stability and superior catalytic performance in converting toluene to xylenes and further transforming xylene isomers into p-xylene. These results indicate that the core–shell structured MZCS50 is a promising catalyst for converting plastic wastes into valuable p-xylene.
