Advances in 3D printing of structural and functional ceramics: Technologies, properties, and applications Driven by advances in science and technology, the demand for structural and functional ceramics in various industries has been increasing over the past few decades. However, the limitations of conventional manufacturing processes have hindered the further development of advanced ceramics. 3D printing technology stands out for its capacity to produce intricate structures and customized functionalities, enabling the integration of complex geometries with superior properties of ceramic materials for frontier applications. Herein, 3D printing technologies based on different molding principles are systematically introduced. Next, recent progress in the fabrication of 3D printable advanced ceramics is reviewed in detail. Subsequently, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of frontier applications of 3D printed structure-function integrated ceramics, including electromagnetic absorbers, piezoelectric devices, ceramic cores, bone tissue engineering, dental restorations, and thermal applications. Finally, the challenges and directions for future development of ceramic 3D printing are discussed, as well as the potential of 4D printing.
