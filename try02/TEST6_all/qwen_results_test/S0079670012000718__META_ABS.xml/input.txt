Nitroxide-mediated polymerization Nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) is a controlled/living radical polymerization (CLRP) technique that enables the design of well-defined, functional and complex macromolecular architectures. This comprehensive review covers all aspects, features and achievements of NMP, from its discovery to 2012. All topics related to NMP are thoroughly discussed and detailed in-depth: synthetic approaches to nitroxides and alkoxyamines, kinetic aspects and polymerization features, range of controllable monomers, polymer characterization, polymerization processes (ionic liquids, dispersed media, etc.), macromolecular coupling approaches, functionalization strategies, macromolecular architectures, bio-related and hybrid materials, industrial applications as well as environmental constraints.
