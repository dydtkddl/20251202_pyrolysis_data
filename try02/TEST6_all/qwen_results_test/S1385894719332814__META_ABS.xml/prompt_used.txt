You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polyethylene high-pressure pyrolysis: Better product distribution and process mechanism analysis Pyrolysis is currently an effective way to recycle plastics. High-pressure conditions can change the pyrolysis product component distribution, but the microscopic mechanism has not been well elucidated. To explore the relationship of product distribution versus pressure and explain the microscopic mechanism of polyethylene high-pressure pyrolysis, experiments under a large initial pressure range from 1 bar to 51 bar at initial temperatures of 330–380 °C were carried out in an autoclave. In the process of polyethylene high-pressure pyrolysis, the temperature within the reactor exceeded the set temperature by 100 °C at a rate of 150 °C/min. The thermal runaway phenomenon was caused by the polymerization of concentrated olefins in liquid form, which was initiated by hydrocarbon radicals. As the pressure increased, the reaction peak temperature was risen and more small molecules were produced. Under an initial temperature of 340 °C and high-pressure conditions, polyethylene was completely converted into liquid and gas products. The experimental results also revealed that high-pressure conditions led to the production of aromatic compounds and isoparaffins, as well as more cycloalkanes and fewer olefins in the liquid product, making the product characteristics closer to the fuel standard. Finally, this paper proposes the radical microscopic mechanisms of polyethylene thermal degradation under atmospheric-pressure and high-pressure conditions.
