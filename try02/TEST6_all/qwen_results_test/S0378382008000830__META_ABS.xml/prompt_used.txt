You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Copyrolysis of oils/waxes of individual and mixed polyalkenes cracking products with petroleum fraction Copyrolysis of 10 mass% solutions (oils/waxes from individual or mixed polymers with heavy naphtha) is a route for treatment of plastic waste. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), mixture of high-density polyethylene/low-density polyethylene/linear low-density polyethylene/polypropylene (HDPE/LDPE/LLDPE/PP=1:1:1:1mass) and linear low-density polyethylene/low-density polyethylene/polypropylene/high-density polyethylene/polyvinyl chloride/polyethylene terepthalate/polystyrene (LLDPE/LDPE/PP/HDPE/PVC/PET/PS=1:1:2:2:0.05:0.05:0.156 mass) were converted to oils/waxes, gases and solid residues by thermal decomposition in batch reactor at 450 °C. Oils/waxes were dissolved in virgin heavy naphtha to create the feedstock. The influence of residence time from 0.08 to 0.51 s at temperatures 780 °C and 820 °C on product distribution during the copyrolysis was studied. The yields obtained from gaseous and liquid products of solutions are compared to the yields obtained from virgin heavy naphtha. It was studied how addition of the oil/wax influences formation of C2 and C3 hydrocarbons (mainly ethene and propene) and aromatics in comparison to the virgin heavy naphtha. The ethene and propene yields from copyrolysis of solutions are comparable or higher than from virgin heavy naphtha. Copyrolysis of solution LLDPE/LDPE/PP/HDPE/PVC/PET/PS gives the maximum yields of propene from all studied oils/waxes. The result suggests that oils/waxes from polymers are suitable feedstocks for copyrolysis with virgin heavy naphtha.
