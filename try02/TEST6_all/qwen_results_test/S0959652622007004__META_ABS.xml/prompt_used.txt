You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preventing emissions of hazardous organic compounds from bituminous composites This study introduces a novel method to sequester hazardous organic compounds that are continuously emitted from bituminous composites during the service life of roadways, airports, bridge decks, roofs, and other exposed bitumen-covered surfaces. It has been recently reported that such emissions are not limited to high temperatures during the production of asphalt mixtures or paving operation; there are continuous emissions at ambient temperatures, and the emissions significantly worsen when surfaces are exposed to solar radiation or high temperatures. The loss of these compounds from bituminous composites negatively impacts both air quality and the durability of bituminous composites. This study creates an inherent scavenging system to reduce hazardous emissions from bituminous composites by using two abundant urban wastes: waste cooking oil, and end-of-life plastics containing polyethylene terephthalate (PET). We hypothesize that the superior durability of PET can be exploited to extend the durability and service life of the built environment that is associated with increased retention of bitumen's volatile organic compounds. Oil treatment of PET enhances the compatibility of PET with bitumen and improves bitumen capacity to retain volatile compounds. Our laboratory experiment shows that bitumen containing oil-treated PET is more resistant than neat bitumen to solar radiation; after 200 h of accelerated laboratory aging, the chemistry-based aging index and rheology-based aging index were significantly lower for bitumen containing oil-treated PET compared to neat bitumen. Our modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) verifies the effective coating of the PET surface via oil treatment and the capability of oil-treated PET to retain some organic compounds in bitumen. DFT modeling performed on six small organic compounds of bitumen showed a better interaction energy between these organic molecules and PET-oil chains compared to PET-PET chains. This study's outcomes highlight the significant role of oil-treated PET in improving the durability of bitumen and in reducing the hazardous emissions of bitumen, thereby promoting better air quality, resource conservation, and sustainability in the built environment.
