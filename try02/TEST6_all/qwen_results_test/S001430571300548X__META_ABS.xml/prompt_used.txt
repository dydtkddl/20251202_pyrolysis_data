You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ternary PLA–PHB–Limonene blends intended for biodegradable food packaging applications In this work poly(lactic acid) PLA, and poly(hydroxybutyrate) PHB, were blended and plasticized with a natural terpene d-limonene (LIM) with the dual objective to increase PLA crystallinity and to obtain flexible films intended for food packaging applications. Materials were melt-blended and processed in transparent films. Structural and surfaces properties were evaluated. Moreover, functional properties were studied by means colorimetric parameters, oxygen permeation and water resistant measurements. In addition, thermal stability, crystallization behavior, mechanical as well as nanomechanical properties were investigated. FTIR spectra showed the characteristic bands corresponding to PLA and PHB and their rather molecular interaction. Py-GC/MS showed the characteristics peak of d-limonene as well as the thermal degradation products of PLA and PHB. d-limonene amount after processing was higher in PHB incorporated samples. PHB produced a reinforcing effect in PLA matrix and therefore an improvement in the oxygen barrier properties and the surface water resistance. Moreover, Scanning Confocal Microscopy surface images showed the dispersion of PHB crystal in PLA matrix. The influences of plasticization process on the mechanical properties showed that d-limonene provoked an increase in elongation at break. Disintegrability under composting conditions was also investigated and it was observed that PHB delays the PLA disintegrability under composting while d-limonene speed it up. In brief, the best results regarding structural, thermal, barrier and mechanical properties were found for the ternary PLA–PHB–LIM film.
