Chitosan-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) amphiphilic nanoparticles: Self-association and physicochemical characterization In this work, we synthesized and characterized the self-assembly behavior of a chitosan-poly(methyl methacrylate) graft copolymer and the properties of the formed nanoparticles by static and dynamic light scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Overall, our results indicate that the hydrophobization of the chitosan side-chain with PMMA leads to a complex array of small unimolecular and/or small-aggregation number “building blocks” that further self-assemble into larger amphiphilic nanoparticles.
