Controlled pyrolysis of polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrene mixed plastics with high impact polystyrene containing flame retardant: Effect of decabromo diphenylethane (DDE) The pyrolysis of polyethylene(PE)/polypropylene(PP)/polystyrene(PS) mixed with high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) containing decabromo diphenylethane (DDE) as a brominated flame retardant with antimony trioxide as a synergist was performed under controlled temperature programmed pyrolysis (two steps) conditions to understand the decomposition behaviour and evolution of brominated hydrocarbons from flame-retardant additives. The liquid products were extensively analyzed by gas chromatographs equipped with FID, ECD, MSD, TCD, AED and FT-IR. The solid residue samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction and combustion followed by ion-chromatography. The controlled pyrolysis of PE/PP/PS/HIPS-Br significantly affected the decomposition behaviour of HIPS-Br and subsequently the formation of decomposition products. GC/ECD analysis confirmed that the brominated hydrocarbons were concentrated in step 1 liquid products leaving less brominated hydrocarbons in the step 2 liquid products, similar to the decabromo diphenyl ether flame retardant containing mixed plastics. The yield of liquid products in step 1 from 3P/DDE-Sb(5) was 5wt% and from 3P/DDE-Sb(0) was 2.4wt%. The presence of antimony in the DDE containing plastics affected the yield of liquid, gas and residue products. ECD analysis showed that the presence of antimony increased the Br containing hydrocarbons and step 1 has 3–4 times higher brominated compounds than step 2 hydrocarbons in both the samples.
