You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Controlled pyrolysis of polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrene mixed plastics with high impact polystyrene containing flame retardant: Effect of decabromo diphenylethane (DDE) The pyrolysis of polyethylene(PE)/polypropylene(PP)/polystyrene(PS) mixed with high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) containing decabromo diphenylethane (DDE) as a brominated flame retardant with antimony trioxide as a synergist was performed under controlled temperature programmed pyrolysis (two steps) conditions to understand the decomposition behaviour and evolution of brominated hydrocarbons from flame-retardant additives. The liquid products were extensively analyzed by gas chromatographs equipped with FID, ECD, MSD, TCD, AED and FT-IR. The solid residue samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction and combustion followed by ion-chromatography. The controlled pyrolysis of PE/PP/PS/HIPS-Br significantly affected the decomposition behaviour of HIPS-Br and subsequently the formation of decomposition products. GC/ECD analysis confirmed that the brominated hydrocarbons were concentrated in step 1 liquid products leaving less brominated hydrocarbons in the step 2 liquid products, similar to the decabromo diphenyl ether flame retardant containing mixed plastics. The yield of liquid products in step 1 from 3P/DDE-Sb(5) was 5wt% and from 3P/DDE-Sb(0) was 2.4wt%. The presence of antimony in the DDE containing plastics affected the yield of liquid, gas and residue products. ECD analysis showed that the presence of antimony increased the Br containing hydrocarbons and step 1 has 3–4 times higher brominated compounds than step 2 hydrocarbons in both the samples.
