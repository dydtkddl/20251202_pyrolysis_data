You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of zero-valent iron-based composite catalyst with red mud and scrap tire as starting materials for Fenton-like degradation of methyl blue Red mud (RM) is an attractive catalyst precursor due to its valuable components. In this study, we successfully synthesized a zero-valent iron-based composite catalyst by carbothermal reduction of RM with carbon black obtained by pyrolysis of the scrap tire as the reductant for the first time and evaluated the catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalyst for activating H2O2 to degrade methylene blue (MB) in an aqueous solution. The characterization results signified that a gradual transformation of iron-related species, i.e. Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe0, might occur by varying the carbothermal reduction temperature. The Fe@RM catalyst reduced at 900 °C exhibited much higher MB degradation efficiency than those reduced at 850 °C and below, proving that the stabilized zero-valent iron nanoparticles are more effective than iron oxides in the heterogeneous Fenton-like processes. The response surface methodology (RSM) based on Central composite design (CCD) was employed to design and optimize individual and interactive effects of the independent parameters. Chemical quenching tests ascertained the contributions of free radicals (•OH and O 2 − • ) and singlet oxygen (1O2) reactive oxygen species to MB decomposition in the Fenton-like process. The present results demonstrate the promising reutilization of RM and scrap tires as low-cost raw materials for preparing zero-valent iron heterogeneous catalysts being active for the Fenton-like oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater.
