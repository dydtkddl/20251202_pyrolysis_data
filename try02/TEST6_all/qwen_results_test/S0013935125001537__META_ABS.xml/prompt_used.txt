You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Achieving up to 95% removal efficiency of chlorpyrifos pesticide using sugarcane bagasse-based biochar alginate beads in a continuous fixed-bed adsorption column Pesticide contamination in wastewater poses a significant environmental challenge, driven by extensive agricultural use. This study evaluates the removal of chlorpyrifos (CPS) using sugarcane bagasse-based biochar alginate beads in a continuous fixed-bed adsorption column, achieving a remarkable 95–98% removal efficiency. Compared to conventional adsorbents like activated carbon, which typically show CPS adsorption capacities ranging from 50 to 70 mg g⁻1 under similar conditions, the biochar alginate beads demonstrate better performance with a sorption capacity of 91.93 mg g⁻1. Fixed-bed column (FBC) experiments demonstrated optimal CPS removal at 10 ppm concentration, 5 cm bed height and a flow rate of 25 mL min⁻1. The Yoon-Nelson Model exhibited the best fit, with high correlation coefficients (R2 = 0.80 to 0.98), low Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Sum of Square Error (SSE) values, confirming its predictive accuracy. The model predicted a CPS removal efficiency of 95–98% and a sorption capacity of 91.93 mg g⁻1. The immobilization process using sodium alginate not only provided structural integrity to the biochar alginate beads but also improved their surface area and functional groups, significantly enhancing the adsorption dynamics. An inverse relationship between breakthrough time (τcal) and flow rate was observed, indicating improved adsorption dynamics at higher flow rates. SEM analysis revealed a porous biochar structure with significant surface area (131.09 m2/g) and pore volume (0.165 cm³/g), contributing to its high adsorption efficiency. XRD analysis indicated the partial crystalline nature of the biochar alginate beads, influenced by the presence of alginate. Additionally, breakthrough curves suggested a rapid initial uptake followed by a plateau, highlighting the material's fast adsorption kinetics. Biochar alginate beads for pesticide adsorption demonstrated good results in the scale-up investigation. This research demonstrates the potential of biochar-based adsorbents for efficient and scalable pesticide remediation in contaminated water systems, underscoring the unique contributions of alginate-immobilized biochar in enhancing performance.
