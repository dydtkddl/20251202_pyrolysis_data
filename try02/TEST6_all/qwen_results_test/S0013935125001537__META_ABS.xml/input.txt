Achieving up to 95% removal efficiency of chlorpyrifos pesticide using sugarcane bagasse-based biochar alginate beads in a continuous fixed-bed adsorption column Pesticide contamination in wastewater poses a significant environmental challenge, driven by extensive agricultural use. This study evaluates the removal of chlorpyrifos (CPS) using sugarcane bagasse-based biochar alginate beads in a continuous fixed-bed adsorption column, achieving a remarkable 95–98% removal efficiency. Compared to conventional adsorbents like activated carbon, which typically show CPS adsorption capacities ranging from 50 to 70 mg g⁻1 under similar conditions, the biochar alginate beads demonstrate better performance with a sorption capacity of 91.93 mg g⁻1. Fixed-bed column (FBC) experiments demonstrated optimal CPS removal at 10 ppm concentration, 5 cm bed height and a flow rate of 25 mL min⁻1. The Yoon-Nelson Model exhibited the best fit, with high correlation coefficients (R2 = 0.80 to 0.98), low Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Sum of Square Error (SSE) values, confirming its predictive accuracy. The model predicted a CPS removal efficiency of 95–98% and a sorption capacity of 91.93 mg g⁻1. The immobilization process using sodium alginate not only provided structural integrity to the biochar alginate beads but also improved their surface area and functional groups, significantly enhancing the adsorption dynamics. An inverse relationship between breakthrough time (τcal) and flow rate was observed, indicating improved adsorption dynamics at higher flow rates. SEM analysis revealed a porous biochar structure with significant surface area (131.09 m2/g) and pore volume (0.165 cm³/g), contributing to its high adsorption efficiency. XRD analysis indicated the partial crystalline nature of the biochar alginate beads, influenced by the presence of alginate. Additionally, breakthrough curves suggested a rapid initial uptake followed by a plateau, highlighting the material's fast adsorption kinetics. Biochar alginate beads for pesticide adsorption demonstrated good results in the scale-up investigation. This research demonstrates the potential of biochar-based adsorbents for efficient and scalable pesticide remediation in contaminated water systems, underscoring the unique contributions of alginate-immobilized biochar in enhancing performance.
