You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of lentil husk wastes and Chlorella vulgaris: Bio-oil and biochar yields optimization The ever-increasing demand for fossil fuels has led to environmental issues and depletion of energy resources, as a consequence, a growing interest in biomass as a promising renewable and sustainable feedstock for biofuels production is developing. In this work, lentil husks (agricultural wastes) and Chlorella vulgaris (microalgae) were selected to investigate their interaction during co-pyrolysis process. Using a response surface methodology (RSM), a series of experiments were designed and carried out in a fixed bed reactor varying the temperature of 400–600 °C, heating rate of 5–25 °C/min and algae to husk blend ratios of 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 wt% at constant flow rate of argon carrier gas, 0.4 L min−1. The yield of Bio-oil and biochar as co-pyrolysis products were studied both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results unraveled a significant improvement on bio-oil yield by addition of C. vulgaris to lentil husk. Bio-oil yield increased from 13.8% to 20.8% by increasing algae content from 0% to 100% (T = 500 °C, HR = 15 °C min−1). While at T = 600 °C, the gas yield increased to 40.15%. and lower temperature (400 °C), favored biochar formation (39.5%), finally optimization results could lead to bio-oil yield of 18% (T = 479 °C, HR = of 16 °C min−1, R = 54%). The quality of the product at optimized level was featured by a rise in the carbon and a decrease in the oxygen content of bio-oil, and a bio-oil with improved higher heating value was obtained. The results of volatile products analyzed by Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showing that, the co-pyrolytic oil was rich in alkanes and aromatics compounds. Synergistical interactions between C. vulgaris and lentil husk, showed that alcohols, ketones and esters went through a remarkable reduction and phenols formation as valuable chemical compounds was improved.
