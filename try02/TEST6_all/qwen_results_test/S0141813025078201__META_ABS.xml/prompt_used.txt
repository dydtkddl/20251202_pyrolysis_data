You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling PET waste into Zn-MOF integrated chitosan-PEG semi-IPN foams for rapid congo red removal with high regeneration efficiency: DFT insights into adsorption mechanism Plastic pollution, especially from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste, presents a significant environmental threat. In this study, a sustainable approach is demonstrated by upcycling PET waste into a zinc-based metal–organic framework (Zn-TPA MOF) and integrating it into a chitosan (CS)/polyethylene glycol (PEG) semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) to fabricate a porous composite foam via solution casting and freeze-drying. The resulting Zn-TPA@CS/PEG foam exhibits a highly porous architecture, mechanical robustness, and abundant active sites, enabling efficient dye adsorption. Characterization techniques (FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, and TGA) confirmed the structural and chemical integrity of the composite. The foam showed an outstanding adsorption capacity of 585 mg/g for Congo Red (CR), achieving over 97 % removal within 20 min. It also exhibited strong performance in binary dye systems, with excellent selectivity and adaptability. The foam retained more than 95 % efficiency after six reuse cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis confirmed the key role of MOF in adsorption, with a high binding energy of −919.55 kcal/mol, supported by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. This work presents a green and efficient strategy for transforming plastic waste into high-performance adsorbents for wastewater treatment, addressing both environmental pollution and water contamination challenges.
