You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Blue hydrogen: Current status and future technologies Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in the world’s energy-mix in the near future within the context of a new energy transition that has been ongoing over the past decade. This energy transition is aiming for hydrogen to meet 10–18% of total world energy demand by 2050. However, such a transition requires addressing numerous technological and economic challenges in the complete value chain: production, storage, transport, distribution, and application. This energy transition is backed by policies and roadmaps by many countries of high energy consumption, as well as many companies that cover the complete value chain. The transition targets green hydrogen as a priority, which may happen if electrolysis technologies significantly advance. However, blue hydrogen, produced from fossil fuels with CO2 capture, is currently viewed as the bridge between the high-emission grey hydrogen and the limited-scale zero-emission green hydrogen. This review highlights the features of different commercially deployed and new emerging hydrogen production processes from fossil fuels and biofuels, along with the recent advancements in hydrogen storage and transport. The review also reports the status of latest key developments in carbon capture technologies, which are critical for blue hydrogen production. The paper also critically reviews the costs and the carbon footprints of emerging technologies, identifies the requirements to attain large-scale production for commercialization, and provides background information for the fossil fuels industry to be an active player in the current energy transition. The techno-economical assessment of many recent studies has indicated that the oxygen-based system, such as auto-thermal reforming and partial oxidation, is the most efficient for producing greenfield blue hydrogen.
