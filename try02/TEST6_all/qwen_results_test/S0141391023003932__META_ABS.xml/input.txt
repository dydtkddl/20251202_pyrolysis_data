Lifetime estimation models and degradation mechanisms of elastomeric materials: A critical review In this article, we review recent advances in elastomer degradation, focusing on four fundamental mechanisms: thermal degradation, ozone degradation, thermo-oxidative degradation, and photo-oxidative degradation. Here, we review the many causes of elastomer deterioration and provide an overview of the models and prediction methods used to estimate the lifespan of elastomers. Understanding degradation processes is crucial to improving the stability, durability, and reliability of products made of elastomers. External influences must be considered to accurately forecast elastomer lifetimes. Elastomers may alter significantly when exposed to high temperatures and ozone. Alternatively, oxygen and UV radiation may cause thermo-oxidative and photo-oxidative deterioration. Thus, while estimating elastomer longevity, these external influences must be included. This article examines thermal aging, ozone aging (surface cracking rate, ozone diffusion kinetics), and thermo-oxidative degradation models. Including diffusion of oxygen molecules, elastomer – oxygen interaction, oxidation state – mechanical performance relationship. One of the strengths of this article is that it focuses on both the chemical and physical aspects of elastomer degradation, providing a comprehensive understanding of the subject. The article includes models such as Zhurkov's law and Eyring's formula, which improve the accuracy of predictions. This article stands out for its focus on predicting the mechanical performance of rubber components subjected to aging and the combined effects of multiple sources of degradation. It also highlights the need for more accurate and practical approaches to predicting the service life of elastomer-based components. This document targets experts in science, engineering, materials science, and industry. It discusses elastomer degradation parameters to assist in constructing realistic models for predicting their lifespan in various scenarios.
