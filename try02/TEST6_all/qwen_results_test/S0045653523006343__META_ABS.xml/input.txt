RETRACTED: Source, occurrence, distribution, fate, and implications of microplastic pollutants in freshwater on environment: A critical review and way forward This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier policy on article withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor. The originally submitted article contained 25 citations to corresponding author Tonni Kurniawan. A further 6 citations to corresponding author Tonni Kurniawan were added at revision stage. The assessing editor determined that of the total of 31 citations to corresponding author Tonni Kurniawan, around 85% are not relevant to the article. This example of extreme self-citation of irrelevant articles represents a violation of publishing ethics and as such the Editor believes that the most responsible course of action is to retract the paper. Apologies are offered to the readers that this was not detected sooner. Furthermore, unauthorised authorship changes were made when the revised version of this paper was submitted, following suggestions for relatively minor revisions from the reviewers and Guest Editor, with two authors being removed from the paper. No satisfactory explanation was given for this change, nor was it approved by the editor. This authorship change breaches the policies of the journal and as a result, the Editor no longer has confidence in the contributions of the authors to this paper and is retracting it. The journal apologises for not having identified the problematic authorship change during the review process and for any resulting inconvenience. The authors disagree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it.
