You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conceptual waste-to-energy design incorporating plastic pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion: Thermodynamics, economics, and uncertainty analyses To efficiently convert plastic and animal manure into energy, a novel waste-to-energy system integrating pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion has been proposed. In this system, plastic undergoes pyrolysis, yielding pyrolysis oil, char, and gas. The oil and char are marketed as products, while the pyrolysis gas and biogas from anaerobic digestion are combusted in a chamber to generate electricity via a gas turbine. The turbine's exhaust heat is utilized for plastic pyrolysis and as a heat source for an organic Rankine cycle to produce additional electricity. The residual low-temperature flue gas provides thermal insulation for the anaerobic digestion process. System feasibility was assessed through modeling and simulation, with thermodynamic and economic performance evaluations addressing key uncertainties. The design demonstrated an energy efficiency of 64.54 % and an exergy efficiency of 63.58 %, achieving a dynamic payback period of 3.88 years and a net present value of 73,524.79 k$. This integrated method improves energy conversion efficiency and economic feasibility, providing a sustainable solution for waste management and energy generation.
