Metal-organic framework-based materials as heterogeneous catalysts for biomass upgrading into renewable plastic precursors Polymeric materials play a crucial role in modern society, including various applications ranging from transportation and textiles to medical science and electronics. Biomass is a readily available renewable carbon source that can be exploited as a sustainable supply of value-added chemicals that produce bio-based plastics. Over the past decade, developments have continuously been made in the valorization of biomass technologies. The new performance of the discovered catalytic materials for use in various catalytic processes has also improved, which plays a key role. This review aims to collate relevant information on the current state of Metal–Organic Framework (MOF)-based catalysts used for the production of renewable bio-plastic-derived materials. Therefore, the functionalization and introduction of different MOF-derived materials and their application toward the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), and 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) as key intermediates for bioplastics production, as well as other furan-derived products have been summarized. The effects of the reaction conditions have also been highlighted in this review.
