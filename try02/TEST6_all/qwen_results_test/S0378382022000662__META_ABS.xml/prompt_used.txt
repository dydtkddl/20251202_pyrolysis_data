You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dechlorination during pyrolysis of plastics: The potential of stepwise pyrolysis in combination with metal sorbents Pyrolysis liquid is a valuable product that could be re-introduced into the refinery or petrochemical industry following circular economy principles. However, halogens in the liquid product hinder this approach by causing corrosion of subsequent technologies. Dehalogenation is, therefore, a necessary step that aims to reduce halogen content below the set limit of 10 ppm. Research on this topic often includes contradictory results, and dehalogenation is still not widely used in large-scale operations. The present study explores the possibility of chlorine removal from a model plastic mixture, including 10% PVC utilizing various pyrolysis conditions, stepwise pyrolysis, and sorbents based on Ca(OH)2, Fe3O4, and Fe. Results suggest that it is not suitable to use sorbents in-situ as the captured Cl in the form of chlorides was released at higher temperatures increasing the chlorine content in the liquid products. The limit of 10 ppm for refinery introduction was reached by combining stepwise pyrolysis and sorbents ex-situ. Fe3O4 displayed the best efficiency, while its reduced form was the most efficient considering its low surface area. The obtained results are a necessary preliminary step for the development of a reliable dehalogenation procedure for municipal plastic waste being underway.
