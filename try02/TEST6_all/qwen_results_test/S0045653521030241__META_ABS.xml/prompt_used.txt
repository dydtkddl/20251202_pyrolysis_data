You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cellulase enzyme catalyst producing bacterial strains from vermicompost and its application in low-density polyethylene degradation Cellulose is the main polysaccharide present abundantly in the earth, an important substrate for the cellulase enzyme. Cellulases have attracted considerable attention due to its diverse application in different textile, detergent, leather, food, feed and paper industries. Among the cellulase producing microbes, bacteria have a faster growth compared to other microbes. The present study focuses on isolating bacterial strains (Bacillus pacificus and Pseudomonas mucidolens) from vermicompost. The study focused on extracting cellulase enzyme and its molecular weight using SDS-PAGE, which was determined to be 32Kda. The maximum enzyme activity resulted to be 0.12 U/mL and 0.17 U/mL after dialysis. The LDPE degradation was reported up to 30 days. Further, the growth conditions of the bacterial strains were optimised at different pH and temperature. The degradation of LDPE was determined using FTIR analysis, resulting in the peak changes (formation and shifts). The bacterial strains were morphologically characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The bacterial strains Bacillus pacificus and Pseudomonas mucidolens were identified using 16 S rRNA sequencing.
