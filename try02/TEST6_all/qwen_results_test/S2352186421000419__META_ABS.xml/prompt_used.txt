You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Can bioplastics be treated in conventional anaerobic digesters for food waste treatment? The “European Strategy for plastics” approved by the European Union aims at drastically reducing the use of plastic materials derived from fossil resources, especially single use plastic (SUP). As a consequence, the adoption of biodegradable plastics is forced by different national regulations, especially in France and Italy which banned the usage of single use plastics. Being classified as biodegradable and compostable, the major part of these materials is often collected with the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Wastes (OFMSW), basically due by food waste, and sent to biological treatment plants, namely composting and anaerobic digestion for bioenergy recovery or their combination. This study tested the specific methane production and the relative kinetics of the most common single use biodegradable items (carrier bag, cutlery and plates), available on the market. It was demonstrated that sugar cane cellulosic pulp materials have good methane production of 390 L CH4 /kg TVS and a kinetic which is consistent with the anaerobic digestion’s residence time typically applied for OFMSW. On the contrary, starch-based bioplastic and PLA materials remained almost undegraded after 250 days and showed low specific methane production yields in the range 100–200​ L CH4 /kg TVS . The adoption of acidic and basic pretreatments improved the anaerobic digestion performances of starch-based bioplastic and PLA samples. Materials made of poly-hydroxy-alkanoates (PHA) showed higher methane production rates, up to 402 L CH4 /kg TVS in short residence times (around 10 days), which make them adequate to be treated together with food waste in anaerobic digestion plants.
