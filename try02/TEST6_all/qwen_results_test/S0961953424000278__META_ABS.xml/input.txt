Adsorption experiments and mechanisms of methylene blue on activated carbon from garden waste via deep eutectic solvents coupling KOH activation Carbon-based adsorbents derived from biomass waste are validly capable of adsorbing and purifying dye wastewater. Herein, a novel adsorbent (p-DES-GHCKOH) from garden waste was developed by a two-stage coupling strategy of deep eutectic solvents (DES) modification and KOH activation for methylene blue (MB) adsorption. The properties and adsorption behaviors of p-DES-GHCKOH were investigated, and the adsorption mechanisms were thus proposed based on experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that p-DES-GHCKOH exhibited superior pore structures with a surface area of 883.95 m2/g and substantial oxygenated functional groups. The maximum absorption capacity of MB was 351.72 mg/g at 25 °C, with isotherms and kinetics fitting well to the Freundlich model along with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The Elovich fitting results indicated that the adsorption process of MB on the p-DES-GHCKOH surface was not mainly dominated by chemisorption, but also regulated by other adsorption processes. The endothermic and spontaneous absorption processes with the stochasticity of MB molecules on the p-DES-GHCKOH surface were verified by thermodynamic analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the introduction of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups reduced the adsorption energy and reinforced the adsorption capacity of p-DES-GHCKOH for MB through synergistic effects. The adsorption of MB on p-DES-GHCKOH might be affected by pore filling, π-π interaction, and electrostatic attraction. The potential of p-DES-GHCKOH as a promising adsorbent for MB removal from wastewater was confirmed in this study.
