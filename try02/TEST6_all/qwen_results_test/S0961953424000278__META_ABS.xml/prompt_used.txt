You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption experiments and mechanisms of methylene blue on activated carbon from garden waste via deep eutectic solvents coupling KOH activation Carbon-based adsorbents derived from biomass waste are validly capable of adsorbing and purifying dye wastewater. Herein, a novel adsorbent (p-DES-GHCKOH) from garden waste was developed by a two-stage coupling strategy of deep eutectic solvents (DES) modification and KOH activation for methylene blue (MB) adsorption. The properties and adsorption behaviors of p-DES-GHCKOH were investigated, and the adsorption mechanisms were thus proposed based on experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that p-DES-GHCKOH exhibited superior pore structures with a surface area of 883.95 m2/g and substantial oxygenated functional groups. The maximum absorption capacity of MB was 351.72 mg/g at 25 °C, with isotherms and kinetics fitting well to the Freundlich model along with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The Elovich fitting results indicated that the adsorption process of MB on the p-DES-GHCKOH surface was not mainly dominated by chemisorption, but also regulated by other adsorption processes. The endothermic and spontaneous absorption processes with the stochasticity of MB molecules on the p-DES-GHCKOH surface were verified by thermodynamic analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the introduction of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups reduced the adsorption energy and reinforced the adsorption capacity of p-DES-GHCKOH for MB through synergistic effects. The adsorption of MB on p-DES-GHCKOH might be affected by pore filling, π-π interaction, and electrostatic attraction. The potential of p-DES-GHCKOH as a promising adsorbent for MB removal from wastewater was confirmed in this study.
