You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Continuous hydrothermal processing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) under subcritical water conditions: A proof-of-principle closed-loop study Plastics have undeniably played a crucial role in the technological and societal advancements over the past decades. However, the current linear consumption model and the reliance of the plastic industry on fossil carbon pose pressing environmental and economic challenges that cannot be ignored. In this context, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has emerged as one of the most studied plastics in the field of chemical recycling, given its extensive use in packaging and textiles, and its susceptibility to undergo solvolysis into its constituent monomers, which facilitates closed-loop recycling of PET waste. This study presents the validation of a first-of-its-kind continuous flow system that utilizes subcritical water for neutral hydrothermal processing of PET at three different reaction temperatures 250, 280 and 310 °C. Regardless of the processing conditions, PET underwent full conversion into monomers and low molecular weight esters like mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), with an approximate carbon distribution of 20 % and 80 % between aqueous and solid products, respectively. The product composition is strongly related to the processing conditions, with 77.5 % ethylene glycol and 94.2 % terephthalic acid recovered as monomers at 310 °C. Furthermore, solid products were repolymerized to assess the potential of reusing the heterogeneous precursor mixture as starting material for PET production. Results reveal that the solid products obtained at 250 °C yielded polymer chains with decomposition temperature, melting temperature, crystallinity, and average molecular weight (50.4 kDa) closest to commercial PET. These results underscore the potential of neutral hydrothermal processing in a future circular PET value chain.
