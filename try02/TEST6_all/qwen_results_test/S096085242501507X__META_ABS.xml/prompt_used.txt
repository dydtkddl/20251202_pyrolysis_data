You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Acetate co-feeding increases ethylene glycol assimilation and glycolic acid production in Yarrowia lipolytica Upcycling ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA), key monomers derived from the depolymerisation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is a promising strategy for advancing the circular economy of plastics. This study investigates the metabolic fate of EG and its conversion into glycolic acid (GA) by the non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. While EG alone does not support growth in a minimal medium, the addition of acetate (Ac) significantly enhances EG assimilation and GA production. 13C labeling experiments and metabolic flux analysis revealed that a small but measurable fraction of EG-derived carbon is incorporated into biomass via glycine and serine biosynthesis and the glyoxylate cycle when acetate is supplied as a carbon source. Ac-EG co-feeding resulted in the production of 48.4 ± 1.4 g/L of GA after 66 h, corresponding to a molar yield of 73 % and a productivity of 0.73 g/(L·h). These results highlight the potential of Y. lipolytica as a microbial platform for EG valorisation and contribute to sustainable strategies for the bioconversion of plastic waste.
