You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on recent advancement of nano-structured-fiber-based metal-air batteries and future perspective In an era of sustainable development and innovation ecosystem, a high-energy density is one of the important requirements for the development of new energy storage modalities, including battery technology. In a metal-air battery (MAB) system, metals function as negative active substances, and oxygen in the air acts as the positive component. Research to date confirms that, MABs have an exceptionally high energy density, durability, and specific power compared to conventional batteries. In addition, they are environmentally friendly, low-cost, and lightweight. In battery construction, fibrous materials have been shown to improve thermal stability, electronic & ionic conductivity, and cyclical performance of MABs. This is due to their outstanding properties that include large surface area-to-volume ratio, controllable morphology and highly porous structure. In this review, the basic working principle of MABs is presented. A critical overview that using a diverse array of fibrous materials related to metal-based, metal oxide-based, and carbon-based fiber shape materials used in MABs such as Li–O2, Zn–O2, Mg–O2, and Al–O2 systems are comprehensively summarized. We also identify the most promising systems according to their established scientific database with respect to sustainable development. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects are stressed considering the future perspective of MABs and fiber-shaped structure electrode material.
