Diamond and diamond-like films: Deposition from the vapour phase, structure and properties A review is presented of the synthesis of carbon films with diamond and diamond-like structures by condensing ion beams and by ionic, plasma, chemical and other methods of deposition. The influence of the thermal and electric activation of the gas phase on the process of producing films with different types of carbon bonds has been considered. Considerable attention has been paid to clarification of the conditions for the selective growth of diamond and the factors determining the formation of a predominantly tetrahedral coordination of carbon atoms in diamond-like films. Mechanical, optical and other properties of the films have been related to the temperature of the substrate and the energy of condensing particles. It has been noted that the thermostability of polycrystalline diamond layers is noticeably better than that of quasi-amorphous diamond-like ones, even though the microhardness of the latter may be the same order as that of natural diamond. Prospects for applying diamond and diamond-like films as wear-resistant, corrosion-proof and dielectric coatings have been discussed.
