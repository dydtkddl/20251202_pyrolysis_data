Pyrolytic-gasification of biomass and plastic accompanied with catalytic sequential tar reformation into hydrogen-rich gas Synthetic Fe–CaO–Ni-mayenite-CeO2 catalyst was adopted in the production of H2-rich gas from formed tar obtained from biomass-plastic pyrolysis and gasification. The molar ratio of the individual components in the catalyst (Fe–CaO–Ni-mayenite-CeO2) is 1:1:1: 1:2 as designed for the catalytic reforming of tar. The steam flow rate was fixed at 0.5 g/min. The role of mayenite-CeO2 in the catalyst and the temperature at which the catalyst was calcined during the pyrolysis–gasification of the Hazelnut shell/polypropylene mixture was examined. The inclusion of Mayenite was to provide the desired support for the activity of Ni–Fe. In addition, sulfur poisoning influences the activity of the Fe–CaO–Ni-Mayenite catalyst. On the other hand, CaO can easily become deactivated by biomass-tar, hence the reason it was impregnated with Fe along with Mayenite which was present on the surface of the catalyst's support as evidenced by the result from characterization. As a promoter, CeO2 improves nickel's resistance to carbon deposits while also boosting its sulfur tolerance. The activity of the catalyst was also monitored at varying space velocities, temperatures, steam to carbon ratios, residence times and particle sizes. The production of H2-rich gas was achieved at 1000 °C using 30 wt% of the catalyst.
