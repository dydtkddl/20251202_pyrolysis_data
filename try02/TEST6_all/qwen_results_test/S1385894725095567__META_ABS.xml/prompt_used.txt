You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar-enhanced induced heating promotes efficient hydrogen production from plastic The low recycling efficiency and environmental impact of plastic waste highlight the urgent need for scalable, low-carbon valorization strategies. This study proposes an induction heating (IH)-assisted pyrolysis–reforming system using sugarcane bagasse derived biochar (BCx, x = 500–800 °C) for hydrogen-rich gas production. Under optimized conditions (pyrolysis at 700 °C, reforming at 800 °C, HDPE:BC = 1:2), BC800 achieved a peak hydrogen yield of 3978.8 mL/g, compared to 2828.0 mL/g under conventional heating (CH), while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by 36 %. Structural characterization confirmed that IH promotes graphitization, preserves porosity, and suppresses amorphous carbon. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and finite element simulations revealed electromagnetic field–induced electron enrichment and improved charge transfer on the biochar surface. In situ infrared gas monitoring further confirmed enhanced hydrogen generation kinetics under IH. Moreover, the IH-BC system demonstrated broad applicability across common plastics, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with hydrogen yield improvements ranging from 26.5 % to 88.7 % compared to CH. These results underscore the synergistic effects of magnetic induction and biochar structure in driving efficient plastic reforming. This work offers a practical pathway for plastic upcycling and advances the design of magnetically assisted catalytic systems for clean hydrogen production.
