Atomically dispersed dual active sites for greatly boosting catalytically synergistic cancer therapy via ROS generation, GSH depletion and chemotherapy Nanocatalytic therapy holds great potential for cancer treatment, using nanozymes to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor microenvironment (TME). There is an urgent need to prepare highly efficient multifunctional nanozymes for cancer therapy. Herein, we synthesized atomically dispersed FeV dual active sites on porous N-doped carbon polyhedra (FeV@PNCP) by metal organic frameworks (MOFs) confined pyrolysis method. The FeV@PNCP showed outstanding oxidase (OXD)-, catalase (CAT)-, peroxidase (POD)-, and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx)-like activities. The multiple functionality empowers the nanozyme to catalyze ROS production and deplete glutathione (GSH), which downregulate the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and activity. This dual action amplifies oxidative stress, realizing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and ferroptosis. After loading chemotherapeutics mitoxantrone (MTO) by π-π interactions, the FeV@PNCP-MTO ensures efficient drug delivery for chemotherapy (CT). As a result, the FeV@PNCP-MTO achieves high-efficiency synergistic cancer treatments. This work provides a promising strategy for preparation of advanced nanozymes for catalysis-initiated synergistic cancer therapy.
