You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atomically dispersed dual active sites for greatly boosting catalytically synergistic cancer therapy via ROS generation, GSH depletion and chemotherapy Nanocatalytic therapy holds great potential for cancer treatment, using nanozymes to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor microenvironment (TME). There is an urgent need to prepare highly efficient multifunctional nanozymes for cancer therapy. Herein, we synthesized atomically dispersed FeV dual active sites on porous N-doped carbon polyhedra (FeV@PNCP) by metal organic frameworks (MOFs) confined pyrolysis method. The FeV@PNCP showed outstanding oxidase (OXD)-, catalase (CAT)-, peroxidase (POD)-, and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx)-like activities. The multiple functionality empowers the nanozyme to catalyze ROS production and deplete glutathione (GSH), which downregulate the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and activity. This dual action amplifies oxidative stress, realizing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and ferroptosis. After loading chemotherapeutics mitoxantrone (MTO) by π-π interactions, the FeV@PNCP-MTO ensures efficient drug delivery for chemotherapy (CT). As a result, the FeV@PNCP-MTO achieves high-efficiency synergistic cancer treatments. This work provides a promising strategy for preparation of advanced nanozymes for catalysis-initiated synergistic cancer therapy.
