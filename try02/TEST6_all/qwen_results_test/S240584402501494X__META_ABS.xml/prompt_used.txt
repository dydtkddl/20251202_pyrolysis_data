You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of four fermentation systems for conversion of pretreated lignocellulose to microbial biomass and subsequent production of biocrude Biocrude, derived from biomass, is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction methods are commonly employed to produce biocrude; however, a convenient approach involves microbial conversion and alkali pretreatment. In this study, the performances of various fermentation systems for the direct conversion of pretreated lignocellulose into microbial biomass were evaluated. The energy consumption, time for fermentation, microbial biomass production, and the remaining lignocellulosic conversion residue at the end of cultivation were determined for each system. The solid-state fermentation (SSF) system was carried out in a channeled bioreactor using the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which consumed the least amount of energy (0.02 kW), however, required 28 days of fermentation, whereas the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) system used 4.44 kW, however, required only 6 days. The rotary disc reactor system was the least efficient because it consumed 4.8 kW and required 32 days, the highest energy and time demands, respectively, and produced 7.1, 3.8, and 2.5 g/L less biomass than those of the SSF, CSTR, and airlift reactor, respectively. Conversely, energy consumed for hydrothermal liquefaction was 0.74 kW to reach 300 °C and 25 MPa, whereas wet pyrolysis required 1.26 kW to reach 500 °C. During fermentation, the solid fraction of lignocellulose was converted into microbial biomass, which was then mixed with black liquor via chemical pretreatment. This mixture was evaporated, ultimately completely converting the lignocellulose into biocrude.
