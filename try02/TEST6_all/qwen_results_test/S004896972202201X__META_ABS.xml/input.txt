Fate of polylactic acid microplastics during anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste: Insights on property changes, released dissolved organic matters, and biofilm formation Polylactic acid (PLA), an alternative to petroleum-based plastics, has been widely used in food packaging and disposable tableware for biodegradable properties. As a result, PLA fragments were often mixed with kitchen waste (KW) and disposed of together. This study aimed to assess the fate of polylactic acid microplastics (PMP) when co-digested with KW. The spiked PMP did not increase the methane yield of KW but had deformation and fragmentation at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. Identification of physicochemical properties and leachates showed that the anaerobic digestion of the KW process caused the aging and fragmentation of PMP, including the generation of irregular cracking and tiny daughter particles, the increase of oxygen-containing functional groups, and the releasing of dissolved organic matters (DOM). The thermophilic anaerobic digestion with KW enhanced the aging and fragmentation of PMP to the highest degree, which was attributed to the high temperature and enriched microorganisms (Peptococcaceae, Tepidimicrobium, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_7) in the biofilm. Clostridium_sensu_stricto_7 was only found in the anaerobic digestion with KW, which meant the KW anaerobic digestion could contribute to the enrichment of microorganisms that promoted the PMP degradation.
