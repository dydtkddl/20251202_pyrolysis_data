You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fate of polylactic acid microplastics during anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste: Insights on property changes, released dissolved organic matters, and biofilm formation Polylactic acid (PLA), an alternative to petroleum-based plastics, has been widely used in food packaging and disposable tableware for biodegradable properties. As a result, PLA fragments were often mixed with kitchen waste (KW) and disposed of together. This study aimed to assess the fate of polylactic acid microplastics (PMP) when co-digested with KW. The spiked PMP did not increase the methane yield of KW but had deformation and fragmentation at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. Identification of physicochemical properties and leachates showed that the anaerobic digestion of the KW process caused the aging and fragmentation of PMP, including the generation of irregular cracking and tiny daughter particles, the increase of oxygen-containing functional groups, and the releasing of dissolved organic matters (DOM). The thermophilic anaerobic digestion with KW enhanced the aging and fragmentation of PMP to the highest degree, which was attributed to the high temperature and enriched microorganisms (Peptococcaceae, Tepidimicrobium, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_7) in the biofilm. Clostridium_sensu_stricto_7 was only found in the anaerobic digestion with KW, which meant the KW anaerobic digestion could contribute to the enrichment of microorganisms that promoted the PMP degradation.
