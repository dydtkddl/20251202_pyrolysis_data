You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of FR-4 decomposition in the hydrometallurgical recovery of copper from electronic waste This study examined the role of epoxy, present in glass fibre reinforced laminate (FR-4), in inhibiting the leaching of copper from electronic wastes (e-wastes). FR-4 makes up the majority of the base materials used in printed circuit boards and would be a prevalent polymeric constituent of e-wastes. To mimic the spent medium based leaching of fungi, leaching of e-waste was performed using citric acid. Metal dissolution tests with citric acid revealed epoxy decomposition during the leaching process and this in turn inhibited copper dissolution by two routes. The first route is by raising the solution pH from 1.8 up to 4.88 through the cleavage and release of amine group in solution and through the transformation of the epoxy surface sites. Both promoted the removal of copper from solution by adsorption of copper on the epoxy followed by its precipitation as di-copper citrate. Tests over various leaching conditions specifically at pH1.8–3.0, temperatures from 30 to 90°C, pulp densities of 5–100g/dm3 and periods of up to 24h revealed various aspects of the process. These included epoxy decomposition induced copper loss of up to 40.3% and the masking of copper dissolution self-catalysis by Cu2+ ion. This study showed that inhibition of copper leaching can be minimised. This required spent medium leaching at low pH (1.8), low pulp density (5g/dm3) and high temperature (90°C). These results demonstrated the impact of epoxy depolymerisation in e-wastes leaching and the potential merit of spent medium leaching in overcoming these effects and in optimising the recovery of copper from e-wastes.
