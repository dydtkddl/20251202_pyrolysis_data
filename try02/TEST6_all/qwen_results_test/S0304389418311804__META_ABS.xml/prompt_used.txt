You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Debrominated high quality oil production by the two-step catalytic pyrolysis of phenolic printed circuit boards (PPCB) using natural clays and HY The two-step catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of a phenolic-printed circuit board (PPCB) over in-situ natural clays (dolomite, bentonite, and olivine) and ex-situ HY(30, SiO2/Al2O3: 30) was investigated by tandem micro reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The non-catalytic pyrolysis (NCP) of PPCB produced oxygenated, phosphorous, and brominated compounds due to the presence of paper, tetrabromo bisphenol A (TBBA), phosphorous flame retardants, and phenol resin in the PPCB. Among the natural clays, dolomite showed the highest debromination and aromatics formation efficiency during the in-situ CP of PPCB followed by bentonite and olivine owing to the different catalyst properties. Two-step CP of PPCB over in-situ natural clays and ex-situ HY(30) achieved higher efficiency on the formation of higher quality oil (mono-phenol and aromatic hydrocarbons) with a lower Br content than the one-step CP of PPCB. Among the two-step catalysts, the combination of in-situ dolomite and ex-situ HY(30) provided the highest quality oil production due to the high acidity and sufficiently large pore size of dolomite. Two-step CP of PPCB over in-situ dolomite and ex-situ HY(30) also revealed a longer lifetime than the one-step CP of PPCB over ex-situ HY(30), not only for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and mono-phenols, but also for debromination.
