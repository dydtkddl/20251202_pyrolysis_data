You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on recycling end of life solar photovoltaic panels Significant advancements in solar cell technology, including thin-film, tandem, and traditional silicon-based cells, have driven the widespread adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Global installed PV capacity is projected to grow from 400 GW in 2017 to 4500 GW by 2050, increasing demand for critical materials like In (38–286 times), Ag (4–27 times), and others (2–20 times). With solar panels having a 25-year lifespan, end-of-life (EoL) PV waste is expected to reach 78 million tons by 2050, posing a major environmental challenge without effective recycling. Recycling methods for crystalline silicon panels are advanced, while thin-film technologies lag slightly. Key challenges include removing ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulation and extracting metals without releasing toxic gases or effluents. High-value recycling focuses on recovering critical (e.g., Si, Ga), strategic (e.g., Cu), and precious metals (e.g., Ag) through hydrometallurgical methods after delamination (physical, thermal, or chemical). Thermal methods like pyrolysis can emit harmful gases, whereas chemical treatments (e.g., HNO3) offer cleaner, high-quality material recovery. Innovative recycling technologies support the circular economy, reduce waste, lower CO2 emissions, and provide economic benefits. This review outlines solar panel structures, evaluates current EoL recycling processes, and presents industrial-scale methodologies, emphasizing the need for sustainable solutions to manage growing PV waste to become a significant environmental challenge in the coming decades.
