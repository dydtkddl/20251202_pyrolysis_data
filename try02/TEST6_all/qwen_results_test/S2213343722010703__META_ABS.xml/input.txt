Removal of microplastics by coagulation treatment in waters and prospect of recycling of separated microplastics: A mini-review Environmental pollution and health risks caused by microplastics (MPs) in water have attracted extensive concern. Developing an effective and sustainable process for removing MPs is significant to ensure aquatic ecological safety and human health. The coagulation sedimentation process (CSP) has become a fundamental method to treat MPs in water because of its economy, high efficiency, and convenience. This review briefly introduces the advantages of traditional and enhanced CSP in removing MPs. The prospect of recycling MPs in water is analyzed, including the generation of hydrogen and value-added liquid fuel, preparation of carbon nanocomposite, production of an innovative open-cell foam, and application in flame conservation. This provides a general direction for the research and development of sustainable wastewater treatment technology.
