You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interactive co-pyrolysis of end-of-life tires and plastic wastes: A combined TGA-IR-MS and COMSOL investigation The accumulation of waste tires (WT) poses a significant environmental challenge due to the rubbery structure, which makes them difficult to store, digest, or recycle in typical waste recycling facilities. Thermal degradation of WT has often been investigated as a potential waste-to-energy approach, but products obtained from the pyrolysis of tires render them not suitable for direct use. Therefore, this research highlights products and degradation behavior of WT pyrolysis and their co-pyrolysis with plastic wastes such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The integrated TGA-IR-MS system effectively mimics real-life thermal degradation and gas evolution processes by sequentially analyzing the decomposition behavior, gaseous emissions, and final pyrolysis byproducts, which resemble those found in large-scale industrial thermal recycling systems. The results revealed that plastic waste alters the thermal profile of WT, reduces residue formation, and promotes the conversion of D-limonene into BTX compounds (benzene, toluene, xylene) via radical mechanisms. Moreover, the experimental setup was modeled using COMSOL to understand the temperature profile. Outcomes reported herein address multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically related to affordable and clean energy and sustainable cities (7, 11, and 13).
