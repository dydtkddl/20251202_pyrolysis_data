Fabrication of engineered biochar from paper mill sludge and its application into removal of arsenic and cadmium in acidic water An engineered biochar was fabricated via paper mill sludge pyrolysis under CO2 atmosphere, and its adsorption capability for As(V) and Cd(II) in aqueous solution was evaluated in a batch mode. The characterization results revealed that the biochar had the structure of complex aggregates containing solid minerals (FeO, Fe3O4 and CaCO3) and graphitic carbon. Adsorption studies were carried out covering various parameters including pH effect, contact time, initial concentrations, competitive ions, and desorption. The adsorption of As(V) and Cd(II) reached apparent equilibrium at 180min, and followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The highest equilibrium uptakes of As(V) and Cd(II) were 22.8 and 41.6mgg−1, respectively. The adsorption isotherms were better described by Redlich-Peterson model. The decrease in As(V) adsorption was apparent with the increase in PO4 3− concentration, and a similar inhibition effect was observed for Cd(II) adsorption with Ni(II) ion. The feasibility of regeneration was demonstrated through desorption by NaOH or HCl.
