You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of engineered biochar from paper mill sludge and its application into removal of arsenic and cadmium in acidic water An engineered biochar was fabricated via paper mill sludge pyrolysis under CO2 atmosphere, and its adsorption capability for As(V) and Cd(II) in aqueous solution was evaluated in a batch mode. The characterization results revealed that the biochar had the structure of complex aggregates containing solid minerals (FeO, Fe3O4 and CaCO3) and graphitic carbon. Adsorption studies were carried out covering various parameters including pH effect, contact time, initial concentrations, competitive ions, and desorption. The adsorption of As(V) and Cd(II) reached apparent equilibrium at 180min, and followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The highest equilibrium uptakes of As(V) and Cd(II) were 22.8 and 41.6mgg−1, respectively. The adsorption isotherms were better described by Redlich-Peterson model. The decrease in As(V) adsorption was apparent with the increase in PO4 3− concentration, and a similar inhibition effect was observed for Cd(II) adsorption with Ni(II) ion. The feasibility of regeneration was demonstrated through desorption by NaOH or HCl.
