Constructing frustrated Lewis pairs on defect-engineered biphasic catalysts for polyester depolymerization Catalytic depolymerization of polyester plastic waste into value-added monomers offers a promising pathway to disrupt the linear "make-use-dispose" plastics economy. Herein, we present a microfluidics in-situ synthesis strategy to construct solid frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) by engineering surface defects on a homogenous ZnO-CeO2 biphasic catalyst for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) glycolysis to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving space time yield (STY) of 472.3 gBHET·gcat −1·h−1, representing 1.6-fold and 2.2-fold improvements over pure ZnO (Lewis acid catalyst) and CeO₂ (Lewis base catalyst), respectively. Detailed mechanistic investigations disclose that the oxygen vacancies facilitate substrate adsorption, while the FLPs work synergistically to activate both the PET carbonyl groups and ethylene glycol nucleophiles, thereby lowering the energy barrier for nucleophilic attack. The catalyst shows remarkable versatility, effectively processing various post-consumer polyester wastes with different contamination profiles while maintaining > 90 % of its initial activity after five consecutive cycles. Comprehensive life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis highlight the sustainability advantages of this approach, demonstrating 73.4 % lower greenhouse gas emissions and 48.6 % cost reduction compared to conventional BHET production from dimethyl terephthalate. This study not only provides fundamental insights into FLP-based catalyst design for plastic upcycling but also offers a practical pathway toward establishing a circular economy for polyesters.
