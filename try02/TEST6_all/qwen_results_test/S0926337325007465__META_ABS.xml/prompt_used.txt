You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Constructing frustrated Lewis pairs on defect-engineered biphasic catalysts for polyester depolymerization Catalytic depolymerization of polyester plastic waste into value-added monomers offers a promising pathway to disrupt the linear "make-use-dispose" plastics economy. Herein, we present a microfluidics in-situ synthesis strategy to construct solid frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) by engineering surface defects on a homogenous ZnO-CeO2 biphasic catalyst for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) glycolysis to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving space time yield (STY) of 472.3 gBHET·gcat −1·h−1, representing 1.6-fold and 2.2-fold improvements over pure ZnO (Lewis acid catalyst) and CeO₂ (Lewis base catalyst), respectively. Detailed mechanistic investigations disclose that the oxygen vacancies facilitate substrate adsorption, while the FLPs work synergistically to activate both the PET carbonyl groups and ethylene glycol nucleophiles, thereby lowering the energy barrier for nucleophilic attack. The catalyst shows remarkable versatility, effectively processing various post-consumer polyester wastes with different contamination profiles while maintaining > 90 % of its initial activity after five consecutive cycles. Comprehensive life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis highlight the sustainability advantages of this approach, demonstrating 73.4 % lower greenhouse gas emissions and 48.6 % cost reduction compared to conventional BHET production from dimethyl terephthalate. This study not only provides fundamental insights into FLP-based catalyst design for plastic upcycling but also offers a practical pathway toward establishing a circular economy for polyesters.
