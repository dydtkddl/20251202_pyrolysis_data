You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of wax pyrolysis oil derived from municipal plastic waste over aluminosilicate-based catalysts The formation of wax during the pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste has made it challenging to handle and valorize the resulting pyrolysis oil. This study evaluated the catalytic cracking process of wax pyrolysis oil produced from the pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste using three types of aluminosilicate-based catalysts, namely HZSM-5, bentonite, and spent FCC catalyst. The catalytic cracking was performed at 250 °C and 300 °C in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate the effect of catalyst type and temperature on yield, carbon distribution, and the physical-chemical properties of the liquid product. The results showed that the wax pyrolysis oil had a high heavy carbon content (>C20) of 58.56 %. The use of HZSM-5 at 300 °C produced the highest oil yield of 78.8 wt%, while at lower temperature (250 °C) produced highest light fraction (≤C10) of 59.35 % with HHV of 47.90 MJ/kg. Spent FCC catalyst still showed competent potential at 300 °C, although its effectiveness is lower than that of HZSM-5. Oil products from the distillation showed that catalytic cracking using HZSM-5 was able to produce up to 80 wt% of the combined kerosene and diesel fractions at a temperature of 300 °C. The selection of catalyst and operating temperature is crucial for converting wax into high-value fuels, thus improving the effectiveness and sustainability of plastic waste pyrolysis.
