Kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of synergistic pyrolysis of Salix psammophila and plastic waste This study employed thermogravimetric analysis to investigate the thermal behavior, kinetics, and thermodynamics of Salix psammophila (SL) and discarded polyethylene pipes (PE) during pyrolysis at various mixing ratios and heating rates. The synergistic effect was assessed, which demonstrated the presence of positive chemical interactions between SL and PE. Maximum synergistic effect was achieved at a 1:1 blend of SL and PE (SL1PE1), with synergistic rates of 5.86 % for weight loss and 0.29 %/°C for the maximum weight loss rate. Furthermore, four model-free methods were employed for kinetic and thermodynamic analysis. The average activation energy of the SL1PE1 mixture decreased by 13.2 % compared to the theoretical value. All kinetic and thermodynamic parameters confirmed the presence of positive synergistic effects between SL and PE. The mechanism of the pyrolysis reaction was evaluated using the g(α) master plot method. The D5 diffusion model was identified as the reaction mechanism for SL1PE1.
