You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Facile and green synthesis cobalt embedded in N-doped porous carbon under zeo-waste conditions as an efficient oxygen evolution reduction catalyst A facile and green method is developed to synthesize cobalt species embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (P–Co@NCs). The materials are synthesized using hard template precursors via single-step in-situ thermal treatment under free solvent conditions. The optimal P–Co@NC composite prepared through rational synthesis and synergic composition shows an efficient electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reduction (OER). The P–Co@NC exhibits the OER overpotential of 350 mv at 10 mA cm−2 and low Tafel 73 mv·dec−1 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The advantage of catalyst is the dispersion of Co species, which are in close interaction with nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. The Co-Nx plays a dominating role among Co species in P–Co@NC and is well protected by the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix layer. That resulted in efficient electron transport on CNTs (high conductivity) that improves the OER performance of P–Co@NC compared to the reference catalysts (IrO2 and B–Co@NC). The P–Co@NC also showed excellent cycling performance from long-term chronoamperometry testing. Interestingly, the P–Co@NC catalyst could be synthesized straightforward via a short solvent-free single-step process that introduced it as a green and environmental friendly method, which can be potential to develop catalyst based on metal embedded N-doped carbon.
