You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comparative kinetic study of C8–C10 linear alkylbenzenes pyrolysis in a single-pulse shock tube This work presents a comparative study on the pyrolysis of C8–C10 linear alkylbenzenes including ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene. Experiments were performed with highly diluted mixtures in argon containing respectively the three fuels under nearly identical conditions in a single-pulse shock tube, at a nominal pressure of 20 bar and over a temperature range of 950–1700 K. Post-shock gas mixtures were sampled and analyzed with the gas chromatographic technique so that species concentration evolutions as function of temperature were obtained for the pyrolysis of each fuel. A kinetic model was developed to interpret the similarities and differences regarding the fuel decomposition and species formation behaviors observed in the experiments. The fuel conversion of n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene proceeds along a similar curve, which is much faster than that of ethylbenzene. All three fuels are consumed mainly through the bond fission producing benzyl radical. The simultaneously formed C1–C3 alkyl radicals in separate cases significantly impact the fuel reactivity and the formation of small C1–C4 and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Specifically, in n-propylbenzene pyrolysis, the decomposition of ethyl radicals produces a considerable amount of hydrogen atoms, which enhances the reactivity of the reaction system and meanwhile results in relatively high production of benzene during the fuel consumption. The formation of other monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon intermediates, such as toluene and styrene, is also influenced by fuel-related pathways. Concerning PAH formation, the kinetic schemes in the pyrolysis of linear C8–C10 alkylbenzenes are very similar, which are dominated by the reactions of benzyl and other resonantly-stabilized radicals produced from benzyl decomposition. The major PAH formation reactions are barely influenced by the fuel chemistry. The only notable fuel-specific pathway is the indene formation from 1-phenyl-2-propenyl in n-propylbenzene and n-butylbenzene pyrolysis at relatively low temperatures. Styrene is an abundant product and its reaction with phenyl is found to be an important channel of phenanthrene formation.
