Nano and micro-forms of calcium titanate: Synthesis, properties and application This article reviews synthetic approaches, properties and potential use of nano and micron sized forms of particles and coats of calcium titanate CaTiO3 and its composites. Our aim is to classify these forms according to the way of their fabrication and provide a brief outline of synthetic methods, properties and potential applications of these forms as inspired from luminescence, photocatalytic and catalytic performance, pollutants removal ability, inducement of biomimetic hydroxylapatite formation and bioengineering. The significance of the CT forms in luminescence-structure relationship, biomimetic calcium phosphates formation and osseointegration with bone tissue are dealt with in more detail.
