You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biosorption of heavy metals from aqueous solution by various chemically modified agricultural wastes: A review In recent years, with the global increase in industrialization, there has been a significant increase in the amount of toxic pollutants such as heavy metals being released into water bodies. Adsorption is considered as one of the most attractive methods due to its high efficiency and ability to remove heavy metals even at low concentration. Agricultural wastes-based biosorbents have attracted great interest due to their capability to effectively remove heavy metals from wastewater. Chemical modifications on biosorbents can significantly improve the biosorption capacities and the longevity of the biosorbents. Most of the adsorption studies followed the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model best fitted most of the adsorption kinetic studies. Moreover, ion exchange, electrostatic attraction and chelation were the governing adsorption mechanisms in most of the studies. The adsorption process was usually spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The regeneration of biosorbents was most effective when acids were used as eluents and this had allowed some biosorbents to be reused efficiently up to 10 times. To elucidate a practical perspective, analysis on column studies, adsorption performance using industrial wastewater, and cost analysis had been conducted. Cost analysis proved that agricultural wastes-based biosorbents are cheaper than traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon.
