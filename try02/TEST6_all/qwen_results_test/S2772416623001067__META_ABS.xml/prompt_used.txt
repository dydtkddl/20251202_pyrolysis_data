You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electron beam remediation of soils impacted with heavy hydrocarbons During electron beam (EBeam) irradiation, high-energy electrons can generate physical and chemical changes in a substance such as chain scission and cross-linking. Irradiation of soil is shown to be an effective technology for rapid reduction of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in crude oil impacted soils. An experimental apparatus for batch treatment of 100 g soil samples was built and tested using a 10 MeV, 15 kW electron beam. The samples were a variety of crude oil impacted soil samples with TPH contents ranging between 1.6 and 32% by mass. Soils of initial TPH up to 9.1% (dry weight basis) TPH levels were reduced to below a target cleanup level of 1% with irradiation doses ranging from 700 kJ/kg to 1100 kJ/kg and treatment times less than 200 s, with maximum soil temperatures less than 450 °C. Soils with elevated moisture content required higher dosages or preliminary drying. EBeam treatments resulted in 1) reduction for both light and heavy hydrocarbon, 2) generation of new light hydrocarbons, and 3) generation of fixed carbon, indicating that the mechanisms of electron beam remediation include radical induced reactions at relatively low temperature and relatively short time scales and not simply thermal desorption effects.
