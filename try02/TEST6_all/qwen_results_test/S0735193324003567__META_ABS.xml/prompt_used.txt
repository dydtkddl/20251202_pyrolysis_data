You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State of the art of the fundamental aspects in the concept of microwave-assisted heating systems As the processing of materials using clean energy becomes increasingly important, indirect conventional heating is being replaced by microwave-assisted heating. This method transforms energy directly into heat, providing rapid heating with instantaneous start-up, improved control and homogeneity of temperature distribution, and enabling a compact design. Therefore, the impact of microwaves in industry is growing in recent years. The complexity of incorporating microwaves into any industrial process resides in the need for a customised design. This is emphasised in the case of continuous flow microwave heating systems where the electromagnetic distribution and its transformation into heat, as well as the dynamics of the fluid to be heated under different operating conditions, are solved. For this purpose, and apart from the dielectric and magnetic properties of the material to be heated, which define how it behaves in relation to electric and magnetic fields when exposed to microwaves, there are several factors influencing the design of the process: the microwave generator and the transmission line, the geometry of the applicator where the electromagnetic field is distributed, the material container of the sample or the temperature measurement techniques to control the process. Additionally, numerical simulation is an essential tool for designing and predicting the suitability of any microwave system. This is the case of composite materials processing, where the application of numerical simulation tools arises from the need to achieve advanced materials more efficiently. In this paper, these fundamental aspects for the design of a microwave-assisted heating system are reviewed, presenting examples of various applications where this microwave technology is integrated.
