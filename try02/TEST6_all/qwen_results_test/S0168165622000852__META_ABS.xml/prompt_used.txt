You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D printed PLA enzyme microreactors: Characterization and application for the modification of bioactive compounds Process sustainability of biocatalytic processes is significantly empowered with the use of continuous-flow technologies that offer high productivity, minimal wastes and low volumetric consumption. Combining microreactor design with 3D printing technology can broaden the engineering potentials. This work proposes a protocol to modify the surface of 3D-printed PLA scaffolds, based on chitosan deposition. Mimicking the concept of microplates, multi-well plates were designed to facilitate parameter testing. Immobilization of laccase from Trametes versicolor was successfully performed, while chitosan and cross-linker concentration and incubation time were optimized. Τhe developed protocol was applied for the continuous flow bioconversion of hydroxyyrosol, yielding a TTN of 438.6 × 103 for a total of 10 h continuous use. Also, a peristaltic flow pattern seemed to favor the system performance, reaching 95% bioconversion efficiency in a total of 1 h reaction time. The potential of the developed system was further evaluated for the biotransformation of different biophenols from dietary sources, proving the efficiency of the system as a versatile biotechnological tool.
