You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Role of solvent in selective hydrodeoxygenation of monomeric phenols The current production of aromatic hydrocarbons, crucial in fuel and polymer production, relies heavily on fossil resources. Finding carbon-neutral alternatives is necessary to address the current environmental challenges. Lignin emerges as a promising source for bio-based aromatics. However, existing catalytic hydrodeoxygenation processes often yield mixtures of cycloalkanes and aromatics. In our study, we investigated a selective route to obtain aromatics from phenols using the keto-tautomer reaction mechanism. According to this mechanism, the initial hydrogenation of the carbonyl group while a phenol compound is in its keto form leads to the removal of the hydroxyl group while preserving the aromatic structure. Our experiments focused on p-cresol, guaiacol, and mequinol, employing Pd/C and Ru/C catalysts. Experimental results revealed that aromatic hydrocarbons were favored during the hydrodeoxygenation of p-cresol and mequinol, while steric effects from the methoxy group hindered guaiacol's conversion. Furthermore, we observed significantly higher conversion rates when using hydrocarbon solvents compared to water, with toluene yields of up to 13.5 % by mass achieved on Pd/C. Our computational simulations confirmed the feasibility of the keto-tautomer mechanism on Pd cluster surfaces, similar to those found in Pd/C catalysts.
