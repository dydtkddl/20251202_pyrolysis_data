Role of solvent in selective hydrodeoxygenation of monomeric phenols The current production of aromatic hydrocarbons, crucial in fuel and polymer production, relies heavily on fossil resources. Finding carbon-neutral alternatives is necessary to address the current environmental challenges. Lignin emerges as a promising source for bio-based aromatics. However, existing catalytic hydrodeoxygenation processes often yield mixtures of cycloalkanes and aromatics. In our study, we investigated a selective route to obtain aromatics from phenols using the keto-tautomer reaction mechanism. According to this mechanism, the initial hydrogenation of the carbonyl group while a phenol compound is in its keto form leads to the removal of the hydroxyl group while preserving the aromatic structure. Our experiments focused on p-cresol, guaiacol, and mequinol, employing Pd/C and Ru/C catalysts. Experimental results revealed that aromatic hydrocarbons were favored during the hydrodeoxygenation of p-cresol and mequinol, while steric effects from the methoxy group hindered guaiacol's conversion. Furthermore, we observed significantly higher conversion rates when using hydrocarbon solvents compared to water, with toluene yields of up to 13.5 % by mass achieved on Pd/C. Our computational simulations confirmed the feasibility of the keto-tautomer mechanism on Pd cluster surfaces, similar to those found in Pd/C catalysts.
