Process intensification in micro-fluidized bed systems: A review Micro-fluidized bed (MFB) is a novel technology for engineering processing and screening application due to its good mixing, high mass/heat transfer, reduced reaction time and cost, but issues that remain unresolved are the low fluidization quality and scalability. In this review paper, fundamental and characteristic studies are reviewed to gain an understanding of the miniaturized fluidized bed system for rapid processing and screening. Subsequently, recent progresses of the MFB applications are evaluated and compared with other types of reactors from the perspective of process intensification (PI). Finally, the challenges and prospects of this technology for PI are also discussed.
