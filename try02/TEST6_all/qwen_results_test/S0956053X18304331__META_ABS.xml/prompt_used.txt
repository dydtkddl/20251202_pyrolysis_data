You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of biofuel precursor chemicals from the mixture of cellulose and polyvinylchloride in polar aprotic solvent Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is the major halogen source in municipal solid waste (MSW) and its recycling is problematic. PVC can not only cause various environmental problems by releasing halogens, but also negatively impact other MSW compositions during waste to energy conversion. For instance, co-pyrolysis of biomass with PVC increases solid residue and promotes the formation of CO and CO2 from cellulose. Herein, we report an approach to dehydrochlorinate PVC while simultaneously enhancing the production of valuable chemicals from cellulose. Specifically, cellulose and PVC were co-converted in tetrahydrofuran (THF). It was found that co-conversion of cellulose with PVC significantly increased liquid yield from cellulose and shortened the conversion time compared to converting cellulose alone. Levoglucosan was the major product from cellulose and its highest yield of 40% was achieved with 2.5 wt% of PVC at 335 °C after only 8 min of reaction. We have shown that the in-situ generated HCl derived from PVC decomposition serves as acid catalyst to enhance glycosidic bond cleavage in cellulose. Moreover, using a THF/water co-solvent could further enhance the conversion rate and increased liquid yield to a maximum of 92.55%. Pyrolysis of the solid residue did not release chlorinated organics, suggesting that PVC was fully dechlorinated in THF. The present study may be applied to convert PVC-containing, cellulose rich MSW for higher valued products in environmentally friendly approach.
