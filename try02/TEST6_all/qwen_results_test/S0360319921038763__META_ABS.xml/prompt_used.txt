You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-organic framework-derived CeO2 nanosheets confining ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters catalysts with high catalytic activity An in-situ assembly method was successfully constructed to encapsulate Pd clusters within CeMOF matrix. This method involved the protection of nanoclusters with PVP and the assembly of CeMOF around Pd nanoclusters under mild condition. The small size and high dispersion resulting from physical confinement effect were inherited in the derivates as CeO2 nanosheets confining Pd nanoclusters catalysts. The relative position of Pd and Ce was regulated via varying pyrolysis parameter, which determined the confinement state of Pd clusters. A critical state was found where Pd clusters were maintained at high dispersion and possessed unlimited accessibility for CO. The specific confining structure and low surface concentration depressed the oxygen supply, resulting in the formation of substoichiometric PdOx, which interacted with CeO2 and formed Pd–Ce–O(s) clusters. With the improved dispersion and high content of Pd–Ce–O(s) clusters, the catalyst converted 100% CO at 63 °C with a Pd loading of 1.07%. The reaction followed Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in which CO adsorbed on Pd–Ce–O(s) clusters and reacted with the highly active oxygen species.
