You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two stage co-pyrolysis improvement to produce synthetic oil and gas simultaneously from mixed municipal solid waste using natural dolomite-based catalyst Among the two pyrolysis methods, the two-stage type gives better results than the single-stage in converting mixed municipal solid waste (MMSW) into synthetic oil (O-Synthec) and gaseous products (G-Synthec). However, the double energy supply for the heating process in the first and second reactors needs to be considered in terms of efficiency. Therefore to complete the research of two-stage pyrolysis, this study improvised a two-stage co-pyrolysis process supported by a Long Fixed-Bed Catalytic Insert (LFCi) attached to the inner wall of the reactor. In the test, 500 g of MMSW with 8 components was fed into a reactor with LFCi containing a dolomite natural catalyst. The co-pyrolysis process was carried out at a temperature variation of 400–550 °C, and the best results obtained were used as a reference for variations in reaction time from 120 to 210 min. Based on the physical and chemical properties, the co-pyrolysis O-synthec and G-synthec products were subjected to Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) analysis and American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) standard to physical properties test. The results were compared with those of one-stage pyrolysis, direct catalytic and without catalyst. Based on the results, the presence of LFCi in the reactor had a significant effect in increasing the mass yield of O-Synthec at 550 °C with a residence time of 150 min. An increase of 20,14% and decrease 16.77% of O-Synthec and G-Synthec respectively were achieved compared to the uncatalyzed, although the presence of 15.5% peak area oxygenated fractions and 3.0% peak area acid needs to be considered as it impacts the calorific value. The dominant aromatic compound indicates that O-Synthec has similarities with conventional gasoline fuel. Meanwhile, the non-condensable gas (G-Synthec) produced contains a concentration of hydrocarbon compounds in the distribution of C1–C12, which is dominant with tripropylaluminum, formic acid and butenes. The high content of formic acid and tripropylaluminum compounds in G-Synthec must be considered because they are very corrosive and hazardous to the environment.
