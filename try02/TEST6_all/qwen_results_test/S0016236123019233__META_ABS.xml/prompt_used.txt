You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of chlorine on zinc transformation during flue gas pyrolysis of waste tires with PVC: An experimental study and theoretical calculations Volatile ZnCl2 will be produced during the co-pyrolysis of waste tires (WT) and waste plastic (PVC), since WT contain a large amount of ZnO and PVC contain Cl. In this study, the release properties of Zn were investigated during high-temperature flue gas pyrolysis of WT and PVC mixture (WP). The addition of PVC reduced the relative enrichment (RE) of Zn in the solid product by about 42.4% at 850 °C. In addition, CaO and Al2O3 facilitated the Zn release while MgO and Fe2O3 had enrichment effects on Zn. Furthermore, the adsorption mechanisms of metal oxides to ZnCl2 were investigated in depth using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It indicated that ZnCl2 was physisorbed by Al2O3, while it was chemisorbed by CaO, Fe2O3 and MgO. CaO had the highest adsorption energy (−147.9 kJ/mol) for ZnCl2. The DFT calculation results for CaO were opposite to the experimental results, due to the formation of CaCl2 which inhibited the adsorption. Importantly, Zn to O and Cl to metal atom bonds were the key mechanisms by which ZnCl2 was trapped by metal oxides.
