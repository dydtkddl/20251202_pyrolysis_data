You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coupling carbon dioxide and magnetite for the enhanced thermolysis of polyvinyl chloride To valorize plastic wastes, pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was conducted as a case study. In an effort to build the more sustainable pyrolysis platform for PVC, CO2 was particularly employed as a reactive gas medium, and magnetite (Fe3O4) was used to explore the feasibility of enhancing CO2-assisted PVC pyrolysis. The favorable effect of Fe3O4 on syngas generation from pyrolysis of PVC was apparent to yield highest concentration of H2 (0.28 mol% at 590 °C) and CO (4.34 mol% at 800 °C) in the presence of 0.1 g Fe3O4/1 g PVC. The GC-TOF analysis of tar generated from thermal decomposition of PVC evidenced more breakdown of PVC hydrocarbons in the presence of Fe3O4, which led to the enhanced production of syngas. In the presence of 0.01 g Fe3O4, the evolution of CO was observed at lower temperature (7.1 mol% at 680 °C) than the case without Fe3O4, and further addition of Fe3O4 up to 0.5 g gradually increased the CO level in the latter stage of pyrolysis (up to 4.5 mol% at 900 °C), which is attributed to the enhanced Boudouard reaction. Good adsorption ability of biochar products was also demonstrated in the removal of methylene blue. Collectively, the use of Fe3O4 in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of plastics could open the possibility of utilizing waste plastics in thermo-chemical process for energy recovery and environmental application.
