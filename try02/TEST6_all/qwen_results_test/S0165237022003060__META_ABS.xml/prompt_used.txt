You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergism and production of hydrocarbon-rich fuel from mixed-feedstock through co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PP: An assessment of fuel properties, engine performance, and gas emission This investigation reports the conversion of waste plastic materials to hydrocarbon-based fuel as an alternative source of energy with a detailed study of fuel properties and CI engine performance including an analysis of gas emission. Low-density polyethylene and polypropylene have been used for the production of hydrocarbon-based pyrolysis oil or pyro-oil. The properties of pyro-oil have been determined using different ASTM methods and analytical techniques such as GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR, FTIR, CHNS analysis, etc. The fuel properties of the pyrolysis oil were more or less similar to that of commercial diesel. The results of mass spectroscopy and NMR confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons like paraffin, aromatic, cyclic olefins, and some lower hydrocarbons. The conversion rate of post consume waste plastic material was found to be 75–81 wt% in the form of liquid, 9–18 wt% fuel gases, and 2–10 wt% as a solid residue. As per the 1H NMR results, the percentage composition in liquid fuels was 9–11 % (v/v) aromatics, 17–26 % (v/v) olefins, and 65–71 % (v/v) paraffin with a degree of branching in the range of 0.84–3.94. The engine performance has been evaluated at different blending ratios using a four-stroke diesel engine. The emission results showed that blending of PO with diesel ∼31.34 % of CO emission could be reduced, while CO2 emission was found to be ∼3.55 % lower in PO blended fuel samples as compared to commercial diesel. On the other hand, the results showed that 10 % and 20 % blending of PO can reduce the un-burnt hydrocarbon release by ∼50.74 % and ∼21.8 % as compared to commercial diesel. The experimental results of performance and combustion revealed that blending of hydrocarbon-rich fuels produced from waste plastic material can reduce the overall fuel consumption as well as enhances the engine performance.
