You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advancements in the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrodes in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) An ever-increasing energy demand has stimulated intense research into electrochemical technologies for both energy storage and conversion such as unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs). Due to its high efficiency, low cost, and low environmental impact, the URFC, which combines a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with a polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (PEWE), has been regarded as an important energy technology that can offer new opportunities to not only further reduce investment costs but also to open doors to the mass production of domestic applications. Despite this, URFCs still have to be further improved and optimized to reach a level of maturity of both fuel cells and electrolyzers in terms of energy efficiency and long-term performance. Currently, the major challenge of URFC technology has been the insufficient performance of the bifunctional electrocatalyst. Based on the most recent research trends and progresses of bifunctional oxygen catalyst materials, this review will provide a systematic introduction and a comprehensive assessment of various bifunctional oxygen catalysts; their science and technology, including material selection, synthesis, and characterization, as well as their applications in URFCs. This review aims to correlate the physicochemical characteristics of URFCs with the catalytic activity/stability of these materials.
