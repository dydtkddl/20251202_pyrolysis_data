Release behaviors and catalytic effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals in coke from rapid pyrolysis of wheat straw The release characteristics and catalytic effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) during fast pyrolysis significantly influence the physicochemical evolution of coke. This study investigates the release behavior, morphological changes, and catalytic effects of AAEMs, as well as the impact of residence time on coke graphitization, functional groups, surface morphology, and pore structure. Under single-element loading during pyrolysis at 1300 ℃, the release rates of K and Ca from wheat straw reached 30.65 % and 9.6 %, respectively, with most of the metals being in water-soluble form. Co-loading K and Ca increased the release rates to 60.9 % and 38.3 %, respectively. K was primarily converted into the ion-exchange state, while the amounts of ion-exchange and acid-soluble Ca were nearly equal. As pyrolysis time increased, K continued to catalyze the decomposition of aromatic hydrocarbons, promoting the formation of amorphous carbon and in-plane defects. However, Ca lost its catalytic effect after 0.71 s. This catalytic activity was mainly attributed to differences in K release characteristics and the content of water-soluble K. Finally, pore structure analysis revealed that rapid pyrolysis within 1 s primarily increased coke surface roughness by at least 18.8 %, with minimal effect on spatial roughness.
