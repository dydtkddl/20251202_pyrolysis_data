You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-feedstock lignocellulosic biorefineries based on biological processes: An overview The evolution of lignocellulosic biorefineries increasing the process complexity and integration through the processing of multiple raw biomass-based materials into several products is described. This critical overview deals with available lignocellulosic feedstocks, pretreatment operations, enzymatic saccharification to monosaccharides and their final transformation into bioethanol and other bio-based products. Aspects as process operating conditions, modes of operation, underlying physical and chemical phenomena, and mathematical modelling are addressed. Pretreatment stage is a key step for any further processing, specially when using multifeedstock. The use of ethanol-water mixtures for biomass fractionation is a promising treatment able to compete with the nowadays more employed pretreatment such as steam explotion and diluted acid processes. Enzymatic saccharification of pretreated biomass has been analysed considering its complexity and selectivity. Its mathematical modelling is described in detail, together with the underlying phenomena, highlighting the importance of mass transfer in a biphasic system. An adequate operation unit design, scale-up and control, and process design and integration can be ensured in this way. Finally, biotransformations of monosaccharides to biofuels and platform chemicals is analysed as they are becoming key processes within bioeconomy, in the framework of integrated biorefinery to fuels, chemicals and materials.
