You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The synergistic mechanism between coke depositions and gas for H2 production from co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes via char supported catalyst Co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene(PE) wastes with different blending ratios were performed in a bench-scale fixed bed over Ni/char catalyst. The synergistic mechanism between coke depositions and gas products during co-pyrolysis was studied for better regulation of H2 production. The results showed that feedstock blending ratio played a decisive role in competitive growth of amorphous coke and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the catalyst surface. For low PE ratio (≤50 wt%) a negative synergy on H2 yield was generated. It was ascribed to more oxygenates that were more inclined than hydrocarbons to be absorbed by porous char to form amorphous coke, which encapsulated Ni active sites and internal pore channel of catalyst, thus resulting in deactivation of catalyst. For higher PE content, Ni/char catalyst produced more than triple the amounts of H2 yield (42.28 mmol/gfeedstock) as compared to low PE ratio (11.3 mmol/gfeedstock). A maximum positive synergy on syngas quality was yielded at 75% PE. Despite the high yield (37.8 wt%) of deposited coke, more hydrocarbon gas from plastic pyrolysis condensed on catalyst and promoted CNTs growth via dehydrogenation and polymerization, simultaneously generating H2. The unique hollow tubular structure and tip-growth mode of CNTs exposed more Ni active sites and endowed catalyst with lower deactivation extent. The scission of more chain hydrocarbons was subsequently enhanced to interact with oxygenated compounds. Therefore, appropriate PE ratios (>50%) can exert a positive synergy on gaseous conversion by regulating coke nature during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. Furthermore, coke structure rather than content seems to exert more significant effect.
