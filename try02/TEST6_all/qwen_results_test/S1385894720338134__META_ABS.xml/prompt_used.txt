You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An anti-stress relaxation, anti-fatigue, mildew proof and self-healing poly(thiourethane-urethane) for durably stretchable electronics Considering the complicated environment in daily use of stretchable devices, the capabilities of anti-stress relaxation, anti-fatigue, anti-fungal and self-healing are very much appreciated, and the above four functionalities largely depend on the elastic matrix. Here, these demands are fulfilled by a poly(thiourethane-urethane) elastomer CBPU-3. In detail, a large amount of cyclohexane rings, with completely reversible boat–chair conformational transition, are introduced into the backbone of poly(thiourethane-urethane), and such non-planar ring imparts molecular elasticity and modulus into the elastomer, resulting in remarkable anti-stress relaxation and anti-fatigue abilities. Even after 20 h fixation at 300% strain and 1000 times cyclic tensile (50% strain), the recovery ratio could still be higher than 98%, and its stable microstructure is proved by SAXS scattering patterns. In addition, the thioether bond ensures the effective mildew proof ability, and the mechanical properties and transmittance change little even after a severe mildew pollution for 30 days. Simultaneously, the relatively lower bond energy of C-S (62.0 Kcal/mol) in thiourethane bonds endowes the poly(thiourethane-urethane) with self-healing capability (highest: 40 μm/min at 80 °C). Finally, the durability and usability of the deformable resistive sensor array based on this elastomer as the matrix are drastically enhanced due to the above integrated functionalities.
