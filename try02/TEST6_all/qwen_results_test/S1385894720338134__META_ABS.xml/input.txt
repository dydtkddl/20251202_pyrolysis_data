An anti-stress relaxation, anti-fatigue, mildew proof and self-healing poly(thiourethane-urethane) for durably stretchable electronics Considering the complicated environment in daily use of stretchable devices, the capabilities of anti-stress relaxation, anti-fatigue, anti-fungal and self-healing are very much appreciated, and the above four functionalities largely depend on the elastic matrix. Here, these demands are fulfilled by a poly(thiourethane-urethane) elastomer CBPU-3. In detail, a large amount of cyclohexane rings, with completely reversible boat–chair conformational transition, are introduced into the backbone of poly(thiourethane-urethane), and such non-planar ring imparts molecular elasticity and modulus into the elastomer, resulting in remarkable anti-stress relaxation and anti-fatigue abilities. Even after 20 h fixation at 300% strain and 1000 times cyclic tensile (50% strain), the recovery ratio could still be higher than 98%, and its stable microstructure is proved by SAXS scattering patterns. In addition, the thioether bond ensures the effective mildew proof ability, and the mechanical properties and transmittance change little even after a severe mildew pollution for 30 days. Simultaneously, the relatively lower bond energy of C-S (62.0 Kcal/mol) in thiourethane bonds endowes the poly(thiourethane-urethane) with self-healing capability (highest: 40 μm/min at 80 °C). Finally, the durability and usability of the deformable resistive sensor array based on this elastomer as the matrix are drastically enhanced due to the above integrated functionalities.
