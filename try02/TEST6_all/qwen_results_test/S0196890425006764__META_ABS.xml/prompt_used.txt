You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Environmental advantages of carbon-negative syngas production from the CO2-mediated pyrolysis of reed Notwithstanding a technical maturity of the biofuel production systems, the selective conversion of specific nutritional components in biomass, such as carbohydrates and lipids, poses challenges in achieving efficient carbon utilization. To address this issue, pyrolysis has emerged as a potential approach to maximizing carbon conservation by converting biomass into three pyrogenic products: syngas, biocrude, and biochar. In this study, reeds (Phragmites australis) were selected as the model biomass for pyrolysis due to their global abundance stemming from the rapid growth rate and strong adaptability to environmental stresses. To impart a sustainability to the pyrolysis system, carbon dioxide (CO2) was introduced as a partial oxidant. CO2 interacts homogeneously with thermally derived volatiles from reeds, leading to their conversion into carbon monoxide (CO). This redox reactivity of CO2 to produce carbon-negative syngas is driven by electron density differences of carbon atom in CO2 with functional groups of the volatiles. However, the production of carbon-negative syngas was observed at temperatures ≥ 550 °C. To further accelerate the redox reactivity of CO2, the pyrolysis setup was modified by incorporating an external heat source and a nickel catalyst. The production of carbon-negative syngas was further optimized by systematically adjusting the CO2 concentration and operating temperature. The carbon footprint reduction of the CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis process was maximized under specific conditions (700 °C and 80 vol% CO2). The environmental advantage of integrating CO2 into the pyrolysis process was quantified as an annual suppression of 1.34 g CO2 per gram of reeds.
