You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding structure-performance correlation of biochar materials in environmental remediation and electrochemical devices Biochar, a carbon-rich product of biomass pyrolysis under oxygen-limited conditions, has attracted great attention in environment, energy, materials and biology. Systematic summarization of biochar material from the perspective of material design and modulation basically promotes multi-disciplinary development of biochar-based materials in the field of environmental and energy. This paper endows a comprehensive review about the recent advances of biochar material in synthesis, modulation, fundamental understanding and multifunctional performance. Understanding the role of biochar-based adsorbent and electrode in respective field of environmental remediation and electrochemical devices has been correlated. Typically, three kinds of biochar were classified, such as the pure biochar with different morphologies (spherical-, tubular- and nano- biochar), graphitized biochar, chemically functionalized biochar. Meanwhile, the advantages and disadvantages between biochar and other carbon-based materials is contrastively illustrated. It is emphasized that biochar material owns irreplaceable superiority in the widely low-cost raw biomass, the simple and low-energy consumption in manufacture, the porous structure and flexible chemistry adjustment, and the environment friendly and sustainability in natural surroundings. Challenges and perspectives are proposed about how to develop a promising design and manufacture of biochar species for multifunctional applications.
