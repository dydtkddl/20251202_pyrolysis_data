You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Straightforward engineering of porous C3N4/Fe3O4 electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium Recently, biodegradable polymer-derived and heteroatom-doped carbon-Fe3O4 electrocatalysts have attracted a lot of attention due to their ease of manufacturing, biocompatibility, ease of use, environmental friendliness, and ability to induce porosity. Furthermore, as compared to conventional polymers, the nitrogen-containing functional groups in the chitosan-based biopolymer generate cross-linking between the biopolymer and metal sources. We developed a highly stable and hierarchical N-doped carbon-Fe3O4 electrocatalyst by pyrolysis of the membrane produced from the chitosan gel with 2 (w/v)% of ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3.6H2O) at 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C, respectively. The produced materials were used to execute an electrocatalytic oxygen reduction process under a 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte solution. Similar experiments were also carried out at 3 and 4 (w/v)% of FeCl3.H2O solutions under the pyrolysis of 800 °C and 900 °C. The working electrodes prepared at 3 and 4 (w/v)% of FeCl3.H2O with chitosan under 800 °C and 900 °C have demonstrated much improved electrocatalytic activity as compared with the electrodes prepared at 2 (w/v)% of FeCl3.H2O with chitosan under various pyrolysis temperatures. These results manifest the effective role of the addition of Fe to the chitosan to activate and enhance the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These results give a broad opportunity to explore the electrocatalyst for further applications.
