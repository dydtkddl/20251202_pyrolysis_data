You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastic accumulation dynamics in Han river headwaters: Sediment interactions and environmental implication The prevalence of microplastic (MP) contamination has become a significant environmental concern due to its pervasive nature and persistent effects. While sediments are considered major repositories for MPs, information on their spatial distribution within these matrices is insufficient. This research examined both the horizontal and vertical presence of MPs in the sediments surrounding Lake Paldang in South Korea, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the samples obtained. The total content of MPs varied from 2.15 to 122.2 particles g−1. The average contents of MPs on surface sediments were 40.47, 34.14, 5.01, and 8.19 particles g−1 in north mainstream (NM), south mainstream (SM), tributary (TB), and Tributary catchment (TC) based on Sonae Island, Gyeongan stream, respectively. The most abundant MP types were polyethylene (PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polypropylene (PP), accounting for more than 70% of the total MPs. The most abundant sizes of MPs were within 45–100 µm. At all sediment depths, polymers were distributed in the order PE, PP, and polyester in NM, SM, and TC, respectively, whereas PTFE mainly occurred in the surface layer. MPs distribution also exhibited seasonal variation as larger inflows and flow rates varied with season.
