Microplastic accumulation dynamics in Han river headwaters: Sediment interactions and environmental implication The prevalence of microplastic (MP) contamination has become a significant environmental concern due to its pervasive nature and persistent effects. While sediments are considered major repositories for MPs, information on their spatial distribution within these matrices is insufficient. This research examined both the horizontal and vertical presence of MPs in the sediments surrounding Lake Paldang in South Korea, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the samples obtained. The total content of MPs varied from 2.15 to 122.2 particles g−1. The average contents of MPs on surface sediments were 40.47, 34.14, 5.01, and 8.19 particles g−1 in north mainstream (NM), south mainstream (SM), tributary (TB), and Tributary catchment (TC) based on Sonae Island, Gyeongan stream, respectively. The most abundant MP types were polyethylene (PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polypropylene (PP), accounting for more than 70% of the total MPs. The most abundant sizes of MPs were within 45–100 µm. At all sediment depths, polymers were distributed in the order PE, PP, and polyester in NM, SM, and TC, respectively, whereas PTFE mainly occurred in the surface layer. MPs distribution also exhibited seasonal variation as larger inflows and flow rates varied with season.
