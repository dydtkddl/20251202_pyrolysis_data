Synergistic effect of DOPO and VMDMS for flame retardancy of alkyd resins New polysiloxane oligomers containing phosphorus, 6-(2-(dihydroxy(methyl)silyl)ethyl)dibenzo[c,e][1,2]oxaphosphinine 6-oxide (DOPO-VMDMS), have been synthetized and grafted to the remaining hydroxyl groups of alkyd resins in order to obtain hybrid alkyd resins with flame retardant properties. These silicone alkyd resins have demonstrated better drying time, gloss and chemical resistance than reference alkyd resins without DOPO-VMDMS. Moreover, the thermal and flame retardancy properties have been investigated using differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimeter. The alkyd resins were applied as a coating on wood and fire behavior was tested by cone calorimeter analysis. The most effective coating contains 30 wt% DOPO-VMDMS and exhibited a 55 % reduction in pHRR compare to the resins without DOPO-VMDMS.
