Carbon monoxide detection, separation, and conversion into valuable products via smart nanomaterials: Challenges and perspectives Developing efficient detectors for noxious carbon monoxide (CO) in the environment and separating CO from other gases for converting concentrated CO to energy sources with minimal energy input is vital for sustainable progress and safeguarding human life. This comprehensive review covers information on CO and its sources, permissible levels, impacts, corrective measures, and monitoring through nanostructured (NS) materials. Furthermore, the latest achievements in developing ideal nanomaterials and appropriate procedures to separate and convert this hazardous and persistent pollutant are carefully considered. In addition to highlighting the knowledge gaps that could guide further investigations, this focused contribution summarizes the strict requirements for practical applications in the field. This review will be a valuable guide for researchers and industrialists interested in enhancing CO detection, separation, and conversion for industrial implementation, including environmentalists, policymakers, and sustainable development goal (SDG) representatives.
