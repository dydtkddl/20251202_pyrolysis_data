You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unimolecular thermal decarbonylation of vanillin stifled by the bimolecular reactivity of methyl-loss intermediate We studied the thermal decomposition of vanillin in a low-pressure pyrolysis microreactor by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products were identified isomer-selectively by photoion mass-selected threshold photoelectron spectra (ms-TPES) based on Franck–Condon simulations and reference spectra. Methyl loss by homolytic C–O bond fission in the methoxy group is the initial unimolecular decomposition step. The primary intermediate, the 2-hydroxy-5-formyl-phenoxy radical (m/z 137), may undergo multiple decarbonylation steps and lose a hydrogen atom sequentially to finally form but-1-ene-3-yne at m/z 52. The ms-TPES and calculated reaction path energetics identified the product intermediates at masses of 109, 108, 81, and 80 amu. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde (m/z 138) and 3,4-dioxocyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbaldehyde (m/z 136) peaks do not correspond to unimolecular decomposition products. Instead, they are formed in the hydrogen-transfer self-reaction of the primary methyl-loss fragment of vanillin at m/z 137. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde is thermally more stable than vanillin, as also shown by its high activation energy to decomposition to m/z 137, 110 and 82 fragments. The lighter m/z 136 bimolecular product is prone to CO loss and its reaction path merges with the H-loss-containing unimolecular decomposition channel of vanillin. Further bimolecular reactions are also discussed. These mechanistic insights, especially the high (self-)reactivity of the methyl-loss intermediate and the resulting preponderance of bimolecular chemistry leading to inert dihydroxybenzaldehyde will guide process design involving vanillin and vanillin-like feedstocks.
