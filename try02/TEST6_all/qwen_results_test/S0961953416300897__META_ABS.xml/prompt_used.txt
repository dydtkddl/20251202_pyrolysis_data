You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of hot water extraction pretreatment on physicochemical changes of Douglas fir Hot water extraction (HWE) is an autocatalytic pretreatment that can be effectively integrated into most of the conversion technologies for extracting hemicelluloses from woody biomass. The objective of this study was to understand the influence of pretreatment factors on removal of hemicelluloses from Douglas fir chips. Compositional change in biomass was analyzed with ion chromatography and further confirmed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Highest hemicellulose extraction yield (HEY) was estimated to be 67.44% at the optimum reaction time (79 min) and temperature (180 °C) by using response surface methodology (RSM). Experimental results show that the HEY increased from 19.29 to 70.81% depending on the reaction time (30–120 min) and the temperature (140–180 °C). Effects of the severity factor (SF) on the mass removal and compositional changes were also evaluated. Hygroscopicity and thermal stability of wood were improved after HWE pretreatment. Colorimetric analysis showed that temperature has a greater influence on color of the wood chips during HWE pretreatment than dwell time. HWE pretreatment shows great potential for extracting hemicelluloses and altering physicochemical properties of wood in an integrated biorefinery for diversification of product portfolio.
