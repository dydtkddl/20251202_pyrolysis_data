Recycling potential of waste printed circuit boards using pyrolysis: Status quo and perspectives Resource shortages and metal demand continuously increase, and the massive quantities of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB) generated make resource recycling and environmental sustainability necessary paths. Pyrolysis is a practicable and promising pathway to lessen the environmental burden through the conversion of WPCB into high value-added products. In this study, the characteristics of WPCB are first analyzed, and the types of pyrolysis reactors for WPCB and the characteristics of pyrolysis products are introduced. Then, we summarize and compare the conventional and advanced pyrolysis technologies applied to the treatment of WPCB for the scientific management and sustainable recovery of WPCB. In addition, we present an overview of possible pathways for the subsequent treatment of pyrolysis products. Furthermore, we discuss the prospects of WPCB pyrolysis, emphasize the imperatives and significance of establishing a circular economy for WPCB, and discuss the economic feasibility and future challenges of WPCB pyrolysis. Pyrolysis of WPCB has been proven at the laboratory scale; however, more effort and time are required for industrialization.
