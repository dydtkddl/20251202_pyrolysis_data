Bio-oil recovery from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Semen Abutili seeds using HZSM-5 catalyst The growing demand for sustainable energy has intensified research into alternative biofuels, yet many agricultural byproducts remain underexploited for their energy potential. This study addresses the valorization of Semen Abutili seeds via microwave-assisted pyrolysis for bio-oil production, aiming to optimize process parameters and analyze bio-oil composition. Using HZSM-5 as a catalyst, the study systematically investigated the effects of pyrolysis temperature (350–590 °C), microwave power (410–810 W), and catalyst loading (1–3 g) on product yield and bio-oil composition. Results revealed a parabolic trend in bio-oil yield, maximum at 38.98 wt% under optimal conditions (530 °C and 610 W). Although HZSM-5 addition reduced overall bio-oil yield by 5.72 %–23.70 %, it significantly enhanced aromatic compound production (up to 24.60 area%). The bio-oil showed a wide calorific range (0.35–19.90 MJ/kg) but contained substantial water (28.82–90.86 wt%). GC–MS analysis revealed a complex composition dominated by acetic acid (1.28–25.55 area%), along with aliphatics (2.49–12.67 area%), aromatics (5.66–24.60 area%), acids (5.58–35.49 area%), amines (6.62–11.14 area%), and ketones (6.50–24.07 area%). Notably, C2 carbon-number compounds were highly abundant (16.63–32.29 area%). Thermal and recovery efficiencies ranged from 0.17 % to 18.94 % and 0.33 % to 31.74 %, respectively. These findings highlight Semen Abutili seeds as a promising bio-oil feedstock, with potential for further fuel-quality optimization.
