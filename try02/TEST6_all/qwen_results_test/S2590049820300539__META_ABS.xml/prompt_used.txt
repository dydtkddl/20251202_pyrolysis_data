You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of boron carbon nitride thin films and progress in nanomaterials BCN materials with varied structures are attracting attention for promising diverse applications. BCN materials are recognized for adaptable electrical properties, outstanding mechanical behavior, exceptional chemical inertness, and high thermal stability, which make them advantageous for corresponding applications in harsh environments. In this article, we thoroughly summarize BCN material theory, growth, properties, and applications. Properties of BCN thin films depend on the composition and growth technique, which facilitates in developing BCN films prevailing between insulating BN and semimetallic graphite. Regarding this, the effects of synthesis parameters on various BCN properties are examined. Dry and wet etching, which are imperative for device processing, are explored. Prompted by the success of graphene, graphene-analogous BCN nanomaterials are being researched intensively due to their unique chemical and physical properties. This article highlights BCN nanomaterials, their synthesis in different dimensions, and properties with prospective applications. We focus on their energy applications in supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, water purification, and CO2 adsorption along with other biosensing applications. Performance of BCN nanomaterials is discussed and compared with the prevailing benchmark materials to present an evolutionary perspective of BCN nanomaterial progress. Finally, unresolved issues are highlighted, and future development opportunities are identified.
