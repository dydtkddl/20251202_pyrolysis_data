Mathematical modeling and simulation of catalytic cracking of gasoil in a fixed bed: Coke formation In the present work a 12-lump model for the catalytic cracking of gasoil in a fixed bed microreactor was solved, with the differential-algebraic approach, using previously published kinetic constants. The influence of different feedstocks and injection times were studied. Taking into account the sequential design of experiments, this model was used as a virtual data generator to validate a simplified 5-lump model. The 5-lump model was also validated with real microactivity test (MAT) data. Although the naphthenic feed yielded more gasoline, the aromatic feed was responsible for more coke on catalyst than were the other feeds. Simulation results for the 5-lump model are in agreement with experimental and virtual data.
