You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and combustion of community masks: Thermogravimetric analyses, characterizations, gaseous emissions, and kinetic modeling Used community masks are often thrown away or scattered in the environment. In addition to the unsightly aspect of such waste, these masks are a diffuse source of pollution because of some of their synthetic components: polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide 6, polyamide 66, and elastane. These diffuse sources of pollution must be processed in an appropriate way, once they are collected. Among such processes, pyrolysis or combustion are to be explored. In the present study, five different masks were characterized before being submitted to pyrolysis and combustion experiments performed in a thermobalance under temperature ramps of 5, 10, 15, or 20 °C/min. Kinetic modeling of these pyrolysis or combustion processes was performed using the EIPR model because each mask contains different layers or components. The optimal values of the kinetic parameters were compared for the five masks and compared with that of their components. In complement to the thermogravimetric experiments, the main gaseous emissions (CO, CO2, THC, NO and NO2) were continuously measured during combustion tests in a horizontal oven. The gaseous emissions and mass rates curves were compared for each mask.
