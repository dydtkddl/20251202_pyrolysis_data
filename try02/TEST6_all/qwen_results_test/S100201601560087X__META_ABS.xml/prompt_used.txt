You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Applied and Environmental Chemistry of Animal Manure: A Review Animal manure consists of predominantly urine and feces, but also may contain bedding materials, dropped feed, scurf, and other farming wastes. Manure is typically applied to soils as fertilizer for agricultural production. The estimated amount of manure produced in 12 major livestock-producing countries is 9 × 109 Mg of manure annually. Manure is rich in plant nutrients. However, manure is also considered as an environmental pollutant when it is over-applied to cropland or following runoff into surface water. Manure can also influence global climate change via emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Thus, increased and updated knowledge of applied and environmental chemistry of animal manure is needed to shed light on the research and development of animal manure utilization and minimization of its adverse environmental concerns. The advances in basic and applied studies of manure major components, organic matter, phosphorus, and nitrogen, primarily related to US livestock production are summarized in this review. Detailed focus was placed on three notable challenges for future manure research: 1) soil application of animal manure, 2) manure phytate phosphorus, and 3) manure nitrogen availability. This review may contribute to the global effort in sustainable and environmentally sound agriculture by stimulating new ideas and directions in animal manure research, and promoting application of knowledge and insight derived from manure research into improved manure management strategies.
