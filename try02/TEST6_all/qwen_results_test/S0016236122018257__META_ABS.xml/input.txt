Microwave-assisted pyrolysis technology for bioenergy recovery: Mechanism, performance, and prospect The emergence of bioenergy provides a solution to the environment and energy crises caused by the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels. Pyrolysis technology has broad application prospects in bioenergy production and waste disposal, providing a solid guarantee for the sustainable development of human beings and the environment. As an endothermic process, pyrolysis relies on external heat as an energy source. The introduction of microwave provides a different energy source for the pyrolysis process and exhibits a different pyrolysis performance due to its unique energy transfer mechanism. Conventional pyrolysis is conducive to the formation of bio-oil, whereas microwave-assisted pyrolysis can improve the composition of bio-oil and the surface properties of biochar. This article focuses on the advantages and limitations of microwave-assisted and conventional pyrolysis modes. Special attention is given to the differences in product distribution and properties and the economic feasibility of the two pyrolysis modes.
