Modelling the chemical recycling of crosslinked poly (methyl methacrylate): Kinetics of depolymerisation Whereas increasing plastic solid waste production constitutes one of the main challenges of modern society, mainly due to the lack of suitable recycling technologies, chemical recycling represents an attractive solution for the conversion of plastic solid waste into valuable chemical intermediates. Herein, a kinetic model for the pyrolysis of a dental industry waste, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) crosslinked poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), is presented for the first time. Kinetics parameters and their statistical significance have been estimated from eight non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments with heating rates varying between 5 and 50 °C·min−1 by using nonlinear regression. Our analysis indicates that the mechanism of depolymerisation of EGDMA crosslinked PMMA is likely to involve a consecutive reaction pathway involving two steps. The developed kinetic model - containing five kinetic parameters only - was able to predict well all non-isothermal TGA runs, and was validated against isothermal TGA experiments at 400 °C.
