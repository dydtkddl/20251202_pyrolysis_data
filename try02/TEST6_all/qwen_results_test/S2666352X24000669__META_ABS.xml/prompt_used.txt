You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and beyond: Sustainable valorization of plastic waste The recycling of plastics through pyrolysis has garnered significant attention as a waste management approach, particularly given upcoming regulations and the urgent need for absolute sustainability. This review paper evaluates pyrolysis's technological, environmental, and regulatory aspects, emphasizing the need to prioritize environmental impact over purely economic considerations. While it is recognized that financial challenges have constrained many past attempts at scaling pyrolysis systems, this paper argues that a shift in focus toward sustainability criteria is essential for the technology's long-term viability. Prioritizing environmental outcomes is critical given the pressing issues like plastic pollution, which presents significant threats to ecosystems and human health. A comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts is vital for technologies intended for large-scale deployment, ensuring that they align with global sustainability goals. This perspective is especially pertinent in light of the current United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) global plastic pollution treaty negotiations, where there is a contentious debate over the true circularity of chemical recycling. Environmentalists and several nations advocate for significant reductions in plastic production and bans on single-use plastics. At the same time, oil-producing countries and petrochemical companies push for circularity in the plastic economy. The paper explores the promise and limitations of pyrolysis technology for valorizing plastic wastes, comparing its efficacy with other waste management methods. Biomass pyrolysis is discussed due to its significant synergies with plastic pyrolysis and its potential for carbon sequestration through biochar. However, the discussion on biomass pyrolysis is limited in scope, with the paper's primary focus on waste plastic pyrolysis. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in utilizing pyrolysis for waste plastics, which are considered along with regulatory and geopolitical aspects. Environmental impacts, including life cycle analysis and planetary boundary considerations, are examined to understand why pyrolysis has yet to achieve widespread adoption. A case study on Plastic Energy, SABIC, and Unilever highlights current industry status, technological advancements, and information gaps. Finally, a comprehensive framework is proposed to achieve net-zero emissions, improve air quality, and ensure absolute environmental sustainability in plastic recycling. Recommendations are provided for the plastic industry and research institutions to support the transition towards sustainable waste management practices.
