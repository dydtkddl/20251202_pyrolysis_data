Pyrolysis and beyond: Sustainable valorization of plastic waste The recycling of plastics through pyrolysis has garnered significant attention as a waste management approach, particularly given upcoming regulations and the urgent need for absolute sustainability. This review paper evaluates pyrolysis's technological, environmental, and regulatory aspects, emphasizing the need to prioritize environmental impact over purely economic considerations. While it is recognized that financial challenges have constrained many past attempts at scaling pyrolysis systems, this paper argues that a shift in focus toward sustainability criteria is essential for the technology's long-term viability. Prioritizing environmental outcomes is critical given the pressing issues like plastic pollution, which presents significant threats to ecosystems and human health. A comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts is vital for technologies intended for large-scale deployment, ensuring that they align with global sustainability goals. This perspective is especially pertinent in light of the current United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) global plastic pollution treaty negotiations, where there is a contentious debate over the true circularity of chemical recycling. Environmentalists and several nations advocate for significant reductions in plastic production and bans on single-use plastics. At the same time, oil-producing countries and petrochemical companies push for circularity in the plastic economy. The paper explores the promise and limitations of pyrolysis technology for valorizing plastic wastes, comparing its efficacy with other waste management methods. Biomass pyrolysis is discussed due to its significant synergies with plastic pyrolysis and its potential for carbon sequestration through biochar. However, the discussion on biomass pyrolysis is limited in scope, with the paper's primary focus on waste plastic pyrolysis. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in utilizing pyrolysis for waste plastics, which are considered along with regulatory and geopolitical aspects. Environmental impacts, including life cycle analysis and planetary boundary considerations, are examined to understand why pyrolysis has yet to achieve widespread adoption. A case study on Plastic Energy, SABIC, and Unilever highlights current industry status, technological advancements, and information gaps. Finally, a comprehensive framework is proposed to achieve net-zero emissions, improve air quality, and ensure absolute environmental sustainability in plastic recycling. Recommendations are provided for the plastic industry and research institutions to support the transition towards sustainable waste management practices.
