Exploring microalgae-based biodiesel as an alternative fuel: Development, production techniques and environmental impacts The increasing necessity for alternative fuels arises from the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the harmful environmental effects of diesel emissions. Since the Industrial Revolution, society has heavily relied on conventional energy sources; however, the 1980s saw renewed interest in biofuels due to growing concerns over energy security and environmental sustainability. Among biofuels, microalgae-based biodiesel emerges as a promising alternative, offering high lipid productivity, non-competition with food crops, wastewater treatment potential, and significant carbon sequestration capabilities. Despite its potential, key challenges remain, including high production costs, scalability limitations, and energy-intensive harvesting and lipid extraction processes. This review explores the role of microalgae as a feedstock, emphasizing advancements in cultivation techniques, genetic engineering, and carbon capture integration to optimize biomass yield and lipid accumulation. Additionally, it discusses novel extraction and transesterification methods aimed at enhancing biodiesel production efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. The economic feasibility and sustainability of microalgae-based biodiesel are critically assessed through life cycle analysis (LCA), decentralized production models, and policy incentives. By systematically evaluating its viability, this study highlights how technological advancements, resource optimization, and economic strategies can establish microalgae-based biodiesel as a competitive and sustainable biofuel option. With the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote circular bioeconomy models, and support the global transition toward renewable energy, microalgae biodiesel stands as a key player in the future of sustainable energy solutions.
