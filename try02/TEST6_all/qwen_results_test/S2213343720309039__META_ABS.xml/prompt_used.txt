You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and low-density polyethylene – A thermogravimetric study of thermo-kinetics and thermodynamic parameters This study investigates, for the first time, the thermal behaviors, kinetics and thermodynamics of sewage sludge (SS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and their blends during co-pyrolysis. SS and LDPE co-pyrolysis were examined through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using different mixtures and multiple heating rates method. A positive interaction caused by the co-pyrolysis of SS and LDPE has been confirmed by the improved weight loss rate and devolatilization. Discrepancies between theoretical and experimental TGA/DTG curves as a measurement of the extent of synergic effect proved the existence of chemical interactions during the co-pyrolysis between the SS and LDPE blends of 1:1 and 1:2 ratios. The activation energy and reaction order for raw materials and their blends were studied by Coats-Redfern model. SS and LDPE blend of 1:1 ratio was optimal as it decreased the activation energy. Meanwhile, kinetics and thermodynamics were obtained from Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Starink methods. Where the activation energies (76.73–355.83 kJ/mol), Gibbs free energy (116.92–123.04 kJ/mol) and lower difference of enthalpy (ΔH=∼6 kJ/mol) showed a promising potential to convert abundant and low-cost bio-solid wastes into bioenergy. This study provides a theoretical groundwork for co-pyrolysis of SS and LDPE.
