You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Use of plastic waste as a fuel in the co-pyrolysis of biomass Part III: Optimisation of the co-pyrolysis process In this research, the synergistic relationship between the addition of polypropylene and the biomass in the thermal conversion process was studied. Additions of polypropylene in co-pyrolysis process can effect to the degassing of bio-char and may also affect the performance of the yields of liquid and gaseous products that were obtained in the thermal conversion process. The main goal of this research was the determination of the optimal quantity of polypropylene that would cover the full energy demands of the pyrolysis process, depending on the physicochemical properties of the biomass used. In this paper was calculated the degree of energy self-sufficiency of biomass pyrolysis process depending of biomass humidity content and with application of gaseous products from PP thermal depolymerisation as an additional fuel. The design of experiments (DOE) method – central composite rotatable design – was used to investigate the influence of temperature and polypropylene addition on the co-pyrolysis process. Using this method allowed the coverage of energy demand to be determined, as well as the optimal quantity of polypropylene to be added to the pyrolysis process, depending on the physicochemical properties of the biomass used. This method (DOE) was also used to optimise the composition of the solid, liquid and gaseous products obtained during the co-pyrolysis of biomass.
