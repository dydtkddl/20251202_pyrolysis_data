You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Petrochemical feedstock from pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and polypropylene using different catalysts In this work, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of urban plastic waste composed of a mixture of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) was studied. The catalysts investigated were HZSM-5, USY, NH4ZSM-5 (ZSM-5 in ammonium form), and their corresponding alkaline-treated (BHZSM-5, BUSY, and BNH4ZSM-5) or acid-leached (LHZSM-5, LUSY, and LNH4ZSM-5) forms. The catalytic pyrolysis using BHZSM-5 (ZSM-5 in alkaline form), USY, BUSY, and NH4ZSM-5 resulted in higher amounts of liquid fraction, which was composed of alkylbenzenes, naphthalenes, and olefins. Acid leaching of zeolite NH4ZSM-5 increased both the specific area and the mesopore volume, allowing an increase in the liquid and gas fractions, and a reduction in the solid fraction. BHZSM-5 zeolite showed the best catalytic performance for the production of a high amount of liquid fraction, which was virtually composed of olefinic hydrocarbons without the formation of solid products. Moreover, BNH4ZSM-5 zeolite (alkaline-treated NH4ZSM-5) was a good pyrolysis catalyst also due to its high specific area and pore volume, resulting in higher gas formation in comparison with the liquid fraction (composed mostly of alkylbenzenes), and almost no solid fraction.
