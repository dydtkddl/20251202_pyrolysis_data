Recent advances in sustainable reductive roasting for spent lithium-ion batteries recycling Reductive roasting is a promising process for recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), since it can selectively recover critical metals (e.g., Li) from the cathode materials (e.g., lithium transition metal oxides). Compared with traditional pyrometallurgical process, the reductive roasting process has the merits of higher Li recovery efficiency, lower energy consumption, and less chemicals used. Lithium transition metal oxides are collapsed and converted into Li2CO3, low-valence transition metal oxides and metallic states by hydrogen or carbothermic reduction. Then Li2CO3 is recovered by water leaching. In general, metals can be recovered from the cathode materials by in-situ (roasting with inherent materials having reducibility) or ex-situ method (roasting with additional materials rich in carbon and hydrogen). This paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages of reductive roasting process. Moreover, recent advances in reductive roasting of spent LIBs cathodes (especially Li2CoO2 and Li2NixCoyMnzO2) with hydrogen, carbon, and organic wastes (plastic, biomass) is concluded. In particular, the synergistic effects in the coupling process between catalytic conversion of organic molecules and crystal phase transformation of lithium transition metal oxides are fully discussed during co-pyrolysis of the cathode materials with plastic or biomass wastes. Furthermore, the problems and challenges regarding to precisely optimizing reaction conditions, thoroughly uncovering reaction mechanisms, upcycling pyrolysis by-products, and evaluating the techno-economic feasibility and environmental benefits of the reductive roasting technology are pointed out to promote the sustainable development of this technology.
