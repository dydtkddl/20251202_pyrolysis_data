You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on the development stages of biorefinery systems for sugarcane processing wastes Sugarcane processing is a globally significant industrial endeavour that generates an astoundingly large quantity of lignocellulosic waste. Annually, approximately 1.8 billion tons of bagasse alone is produced, representing a substantial by-product of the sugarcane industry. However, current disposal practices, such as landfilling without proper methane capture systems or incineration using outdated technologies, exacerbate the environmental burden. Landfills release methane, a greenhouse gas with over 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a 100 - year period, whereas sub-standard incineration emits harmful pollutants such as particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. An in-depth review is presented, examining diverse biorefinery pathways for the conversion of these wastes. Bagasse conversion into bioenergy, such as ethanol via enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of cellulose and hemicellulose, and biogas via anaerobic digestion, is a promising approach. Biochemical production from sugarcane waste feedstocks, such as citric acid via microbial fermentation and polylactic acid (PLA), presents considerable potential. Benchmarking apple pomace valorization reveals sugarcane waste's unique utilization potential. Three systemic barriers persist: poor integration (resource inefficiency), economic fragility (feedstock price volatility and high costs), and inadequate life-cycle assessments. AI-driven modular platforms for optimization, dynamic techno-economic models, and region-specific sustainability metrics. These findings position sugarcane waste as a cornerstone of the circular bioeconomy, particularly in sugarcane-growing nations of the Global South.
