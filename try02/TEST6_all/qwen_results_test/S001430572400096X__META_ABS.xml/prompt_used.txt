You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emerging trends in biodegradable polymer-metal nanoconjugates for cancer therapeutics Conventional anticancer therapies, though still effective for treating cancer, have several drawbacks that can be overcome with the help of nanoparticles. In recent times, the focus has shifted to the utilization of a newer class of nanostructures called polymer-metal nanocomposites due to its combined diagnostic and therapeutic roles for high-efficient and low-toxicity anticancer therapies. Improper metal ion distribution or absorption in cells can stymie cellular functions, causing irreparable physical damage or triggering metabolic responses that lead to cell death. As a result, nanocomposites composed of metal nanostructure cores embedded in polymer matrixes/shells, show improved stability and excellent biocompatibility, making them better for targeting, drug delivery, therapy and cancer cell imaging. Therapeutic systems based on polymeric-metallic nanoparticles not only provide simultaneous diagnostic and therapy, but also allow for controlled and targeted drug release, revamping cancer treatment and management. This review is going to focus on various such polymer-metal nanocomposites and their therapeutic applications in enhancing targeted cancer treatment especially delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, this review will delve into the utilization of metallic-polymer nanoconjugates/nanocomposites comprised of various metals such as gold, silver, bismuth, manganese oxide, iron/iron oxide, copper oxide, and others in the realm of cancer therapy. Additionally, an overview will be provided regarding the existing progress and development of these solutions through clinical trials.
