The influence of crystallinity on the depolymerization mechanism of PET fibers The high-efficiency depolymerization and recycling of polyester (PET) fibers are of great significance for reducing energy consumption, improving resource utilization efficiency, and achieving high-value utilization of by-products. Reaction kinetics is a key factor for enhancing reaction efficiency, lowering energy consumption, and developing high-value products. However, in industrial methods for recycling waste polyester textiles, the diverse degrees of crystallinity of these textiles make the impact of crystallinity on reaction kinetics and the specific reaction mechanisms unclear. In this study, by investigating the glycolysis pathways of PET fibers with different crystallinities and at various reaction temperatures, we established a kinetic model for the glycolysis of PET fibers with different crystallinities and discovered a new depolymerization mechanism. The experimental curves of glycolysis of PET fibers catalyzed by zinc acetate at different reaction temperatures (165 °C - 180 °C) closely match the theoretical curves of the nucleation-controlled model. At low crystallinity (10 %), the glycolysis of PET by ethylene glycol (EG) involves both internal and external depolymerization simultaneously. At higher crystallinities (15 %, 26 %, 33 %, and 43 %), the glycolysis of PET by EG occurs through gradual external depolymerization, layer by layer. These findings are expected to guide the development of more efficient PET depolymerization processes and have significant implications for the low-energy recycling of polyester.
