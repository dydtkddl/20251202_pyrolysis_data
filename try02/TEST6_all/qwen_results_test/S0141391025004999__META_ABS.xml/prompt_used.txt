You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The influence of crystallinity on the depolymerization mechanism of PET fibers The high-efficiency depolymerization and recycling of polyester (PET) fibers are of great significance for reducing energy consumption, improving resource utilization efficiency, and achieving high-value utilization of by-products. Reaction kinetics is a key factor for enhancing reaction efficiency, lowering energy consumption, and developing high-value products. However, in industrial methods for recycling waste polyester textiles, the diverse degrees of crystallinity of these textiles make the impact of crystallinity on reaction kinetics and the specific reaction mechanisms unclear. In this study, by investigating the glycolysis pathways of PET fibers with different crystallinities and at various reaction temperatures, we established a kinetic model for the glycolysis of PET fibers with different crystallinities and discovered a new depolymerization mechanism. The experimental curves of glycolysis of PET fibers catalyzed by zinc acetate at different reaction temperatures (165 °C - 180 °C) closely match the theoretical curves of the nucleation-controlled model. At low crystallinity (10 %), the glycolysis of PET by ethylene glycol (EG) involves both internal and external depolymerization simultaneously. At higher crystallinities (15 %, 26 %, 33 %, and 43 %), the glycolysis of PET by EG occurs through gradual external depolymerization, layer by layer. These findings are expected to guide the development of more efficient PET depolymerization processes and have significant implications for the low-energy recycling of polyester.
