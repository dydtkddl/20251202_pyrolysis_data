A comprehensive review on the production of alternative fuel through medical plastic waste This paper aims to critically review the production of alternative fuels through medical plastic waste. In the recent past, medical plastic waste has been disposed of and incinerated in the dumping yards, which is the main cause of the threat of infection and environmental hazards.Adopting proper waste management and the appropriate technology like the 5R’s (refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle) may significantly improve the ecosystem. Moreover, the 5R’s is a comprehensive approach that can be applied, either awareness of stakeholders or enforcement mandate and regulation by the government. The current review suggested the possible route for converting medical-plastic waste into drop-in fuel and value-added products to minimize the waste through suitable technology. In this, the pyrolysis technique plays an important role which is more ecologically friendly, effective and produces minimal pollutants. It has been observed that using COVID medical waste management (CMWM) technology, 70–80 % plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO), 10–15% bio-char, and gaseous fuel can be extracted. As per the ASTM, the extracted PPO is a potential feedstock for the CI engine fuel. This review work provides a suitable solution for CMWM and improves the quality of medical infrastructure for sanitation in a sustainable mode.
