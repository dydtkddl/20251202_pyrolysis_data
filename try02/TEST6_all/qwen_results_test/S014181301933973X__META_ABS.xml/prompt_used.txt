You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of calcium and sodium alginate: A greener synthesis towards calcium oxide micro/nanoparticles Processes for nanoparticle synthesis often use toxic solvents under aggressive conditions. A greener alternative is the burning of self-organized alginate systems. We followed the influence of the CaCl2 concentrations during gelation of sodium alginate and the heating rate on the synthesis of nanoparticles by the combustion method using TGA as a reactor vessel. Samples were collected after each main process of mass loss and characterized using the Scanning Electron Microscopy, Infrared Spectroscopy, and X-ray Diffraction. Samples treated at 50 °C·min−1 presented porous structures at temperatures more than 500 °C lower than the treatments at 10 °C·min−1. All calcium alginate samples presented changing from a predominantly amorphous to crystalline structures such as Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 in the calcite phase and CaO as a function of the temperature, while sodium alginate produced mainly Na2CO3, NaOH and NaO. We observed two main correlations: 1) between the porosity and the heating rate, and 2) between the formation of crystalline structure in intermediate temperatures and the CaCl2 concentration in the gelation step.
