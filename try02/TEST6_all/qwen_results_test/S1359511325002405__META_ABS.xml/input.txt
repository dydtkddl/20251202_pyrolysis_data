Towards a circular economy: Harnessing bacteria for sustainable plastic waste degradation The increasing prevalence of plastic pollution poses a significant environmental challenge, necessitating innovative and sustainable approaches to waste management. In this research the biodegradation potential of two prominent bacterial genera, Pseudomonas and Bacillus. These have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in degrading various plastic polymers, including LDPE, HDPE, PP, PET, and PLA. Both genera exhibit a broad substrate range and employ diverse enzymatic mechanisms, such as lipases, hydrolases, and laccases, to facilitate plastic breakdown. While strain specificity is crucial in degradation efficiency, studies indicate synergistic interactions in mixed-culture consortia can enhance overall degradation rates. Despite the promising advancements in bacterial plastic degradation, challenges remain, including variability in degradation rates and the need for standardized testing protocols. Future research should focus on identifying high-performing strains, characterizing their enzymatic profiles, and optimizing environmental conditions to improve biodegradation outcomes. By harnessing the natural capabilities of bacteria, this work highlights the potential for developing effective bioremediation strategies that contribute to a circular economy and address the pressing issue of plastic waste.
