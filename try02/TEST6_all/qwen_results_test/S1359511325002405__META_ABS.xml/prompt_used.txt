You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards a circular economy: Harnessing bacteria for sustainable plastic waste degradation The increasing prevalence of plastic pollution poses a significant environmental challenge, necessitating innovative and sustainable approaches to waste management. In this research the biodegradation potential of two prominent bacterial genera, Pseudomonas and Bacillus. These have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in degrading various plastic polymers, including LDPE, HDPE, PP, PET, and PLA. Both genera exhibit a broad substrate range and employ diverse enzymatic mechanisms, such as lipases, hydrolases, and laccases, to facilitate plastic breakdown. While strain specificity is crucial in degradation efficiency, studies indicate synergistic interactions in mixed-culture consortia can enhance overall degradation rates. Despite the promising advancements in bacterial plastic degradation, challenges remain, including variability in degradation rates and the need for standardized testing protocols. Future research should focus on identifying high-performing strains, characterizing their enzymatic profiles, and optimizing environmental conditions to improve biodegradation outcomes. By harnessing the natural capabilities of bacteria, this work highlights the potential for developing effective bioremediation strategies that contribute to a circular economy and address the pressing issue of plastic waste.
