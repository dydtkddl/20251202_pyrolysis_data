You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of CaCO3/MgO on Fe-Co-Mo catalyst in the reprocessing of recycled polypropylene to carbon nanotubes In recent times, there has been a global discourse on the menace of plastic waste (PW) materials on the ecosystem and ways for effective management of PW. This has resulted in the utilization of PW in the research arena in the synthesis of smart nanomaterials of high value as a sustainable solution. In this study, the catalytic-pyrolysis procedure was used to develop carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from recycled polypropylene (PP) plastic in a one-step chemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactor. The impacts of CaCO3 and MgO as supports for Fe-Co-Mo catalysts in the production of CNTs were studied. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were determined from the thermal profile of the catalysts to establish the nature of the reaction in CNTs synthesis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), selected area electron diffraction pattern, particle size distribution (PSD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to characterize the catalysts and CNTs. The results obtained showed the impact of the supports on the yield, quality, and morphology of the synthesized CNTs. The CNTs yield from catalysts supported with CaCO3 and MgO were 35.12 % and 37.24% respectively. The average outer diameters of CNTs produced over the catalyst with CaCO3 and MgO supports were 36 and 29 nm respectively. The ID/IG ratio for CaCO3 and MgO supports were 0.6724 and 0.8401 respectively. The change in entropy for all phases were −274.41 and −1032.97 J/mol/K and −213.0, −318.48 and −1022.13 J/mol/K for CaCO3 and MgO supported catalyst respectively which confirmed non-spontaneous endothermic reaction. It was observed that MgO support showed better catalytic activity toward CNTs growth in terms of yield while those with CaCO3 support showed higher graphitization.
