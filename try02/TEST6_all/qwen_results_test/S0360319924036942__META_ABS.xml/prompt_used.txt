You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalyst breakthroughs in methane dry reforming: Employing machine learning for future advancements Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have sparked the interest of researchers in resolving this issue. Various technologies have been utilized such as dry reformation of methane (DRM), that turns these greenhouse gases (GHGs) into syngas. Numerous studies have been done in recent years to produce efficient and competitive catalysts for DRM. However, a “state of the art” review is still required due to a lack of literature on improvements and scalability of robust catalytic systems. This study aims to evaluate recent advancements in catalyst formulations, their activities, stability, and selectivity. We have discussed a variety of materials, including Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF), a type of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXene), reducible and irreducible metal oxides, transition metal oxides, zeolites, carbon, and biochar-based catalysts, which are responsible for improving the effectiveness of the DRM process. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) approaches are highlighted for their potential in catalyst design and optimization, providing increased accuracy and efficiency. This review highlights major enhancements to the DRM method, which result in higher hydrogen yield and catalyst stability. Novel catalysts have been created to tackle crucial problems including coking and sintering, which are necessary to progress commercialization. To ensure successful commercial application, future research should concentrate on finding catalysts with excellent features that are also economically viable. This study provides a significant resource for future catalyst development and promotes greater cooperation between academic and commercial communities.
