You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction of low cycle fatigue life for neutron-irradiated and nonirradiated RAFM steels using their tensile properties Reduced Activation Ferritic-Martensitic (RAFM) steels are the candidate structural steels for In-Vessel Components of fusion reactors. Since the operation of a tokamak-type fusion reactor is cyclic by its nature, thermomechanical fatigue will be one of the limiting factors defining the life of the plasma-facing components exposed to neutron irradiation. The assessment of fatigue life requires considerable efforts in terms of low cycle fatigue experiments, which is extremely complicated on neutron-irradiated specimens inside the hot cell environment. Performing tensile tests is instead much faster, technically easier and more cost effective than performing fatigue tests especially on neutron-activated specimens. Therefore, a method for predicting fatigue life based on the tensile properties would be an important asset to assess the design of IVC when experimental data on fatigue are not available. Here, several fatigue life prediction methods based on Universal Slopes Equation were assessed based on the fatigue test results of RAFM steels in the irradiated and non-irradiated conditions to choose the best method. Analysis of the available fatigue database showed an effect of test medium and specimen size on the fatigue life. This effect was quantified and added to the selected method by means of scaling factors. The chosen method with the scaling factors was able to predict the fatigue life of irradiated and non-irradiated RAFM steels with an accuracy of 95% within the sleeve of factor three. The modified equations were then used to predict the fatigue life of irradiated RAFM steels at irradiation doses for which the fatigue data is not available.
