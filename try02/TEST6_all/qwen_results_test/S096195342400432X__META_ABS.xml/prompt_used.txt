You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Piezoresistivity in pyrolyzed coconut fiber Pyrolyzed carbon materials give fascinating solutions for many problems in the current research world. The locally available organic wastes can be pyrolyzed and tuned for their properties for various applications. Coconut-based materials such as shell and fiber have shown promising results in different technological applications. However, a detailed study of the structural and property evolution of these materials has not been carried out yet. In this work, the evolution of conductivity and piezoresistivity of coconut fiber-derived carbon is studied. Coconut fiber is pyrolyzed at different temperatures 600 °C, (CCP600) 800 °C (CCP800) and 1000 °C (CCP1000) to produce carbon fiber. Electrical conductivity experiments show differences between CCP600, CCP800 and CCP1000, with CCP600 displaying much lower conductivity at approximately (0.7 S/m) compared to CCP800 (1 × 103 S/m) and CCP1000 (1.4 × 103 S/m). Conversely, CCP600 demonstrates impressive piezoresistive characteristics, exhibiting significant resistance changes even under minimal strain. The gauge factor for the coconut fiber-derived carbon was found to be 4.1 for CCP600, 1.0 for CCP800, and 0.3 for CCP1000. Further, the powdered carbon samples show an increase in the gauge factor to a range of 36.8, which makes CCP600 well-suited for sensor applications requiring precise sensing capabilities. The present study suggests that CCP600, with its low cost and ease of fabrication, is a promising material for low-budget sensor applications.
