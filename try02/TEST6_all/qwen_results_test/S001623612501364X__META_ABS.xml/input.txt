Chemical interactions between NO and soot/gaseous hydrocarbon precursors in the pyrolysis of C2H4/NO mixtures A combined experimental and Reactive Force Field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) study is conducted to investigate the chemical interactions between NO and large hydrocarbon species (e.g., soot and its gaseous precursors). Co-pyrolysis experiments of C2H4/NO mixtures are carried out based on a plug flow reactor (PFR) and the outlet concentrations of C2H4 and C2H2 as well as C6H6 are measured using gas chromatograph (GC). Then ReaxFF MD simulations are performed to depict the time-resolved process, including fuel thermal decomposition, formation and growth of PAHs, as well as soot formation in the co-pyrolysis of C2H4/NO mixtures. It is experimentally observed that NO addition reduces the rate of thermal decomposition and conversion of C2H4. In addition, the addition of NO inhibits the formation of C2H2, C6H6 and soot. The ReaxFF MD results reveal that most NO molecules (92 %) initially undergo the separation of N and O atoms by reacting with hydrocarbons or H/H2 species, thus converting NO into nitrogen-containing species (mainly NH and NH2 radicals) and oxygen-containing species (mainly O2 and OH radicals). Especially, the chemical interaction between NO and large hydrocarbon species (such as C3H5, C6H3 and C12H5) is observed first, which suggests the existence of richer reaction pathways than those in the current reaction mechanism and provides new insights for improving it. At the end of the simulations, the majority of N atoms (87 %) exist in the form of HCN or C2N, while O atoms are present in CO and H2O. Importantly, direct oxidation of NO on soot particles is not observed, revealing that the formation of HCN and CO reduces the migration of C atoms into larger hydrocarbons, thereby decreasing soot formation.
