You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development and integration of a continuous horizontal belt filter into drug production procedure In the pharmaceutical industry, filtration is traditionally carried out in batch mode. However, with the spread of continuous technologies, there is an increasing demand for robust continuous filtration strategies suitable for processing suspensions produced in continuous crystallizers. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate a lab-scale horizontal conveyor belt filtration approach for pharmaceutical separation purposes for the first time. The newly developed continuous horizontal belt filter (CHBF) was tested under different systems (microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)/water, lactose/ethanol and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)/water) and diverse conditions. Filtration was robust using a well-defined unimodal particle size distribution MCC in water system, where the residual moisture content varied within narrow limits of 45–52% independently from the process conditions. Besides, the residual moisture content highly depended on the applied solvent and particle size. It could be reduced to below 2% by processing the suspensions of either a volatile solvent (lactose in ethanol) or an aqueous slurry of a large particle size ASA. Finally, the CHBF was connected to a mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) or a plug flow crystallizer (PFC). The residual moisture content of the CHBF-filtered ASA product and operation characteristics (onset of steady-state) were evaluated in both continuous crystallizer-filter systems. The MSMPR-CHBF system operated with a longer startup period. The size of the in situ-produced crystals was of a similar order magnitude in both systems, resulting in a similar residual moisture content (around 20%). Overall, the tested continuous filter was robust, did not modify the crystal morphology in the examined experimental range, and could be effectively integrated with continuous crystallizers.
