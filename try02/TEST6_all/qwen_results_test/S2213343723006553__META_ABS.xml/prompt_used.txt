You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanochemical dehalogenation of brominated flame retardants and preliminary application for recycling BFR-containing plastic waste Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is one of the most widely used brominated flame retardant (BFR), which has attracted increasing attention due to the persistence, bioaccumulation and adverse effect to wildlife and human. Considering the strong need for the disposal of HBCD containing waste, mechanochemical (MC) pretreatment technology was investigated to destroy BFRs as a dehalogenation method in this study. Silica and aluminium powders were used as additives, and mechanochemical method was applied to degrade BFRs for both HBCD powder and waste plastics. The results showed that HBCD was effectively degraded during mechanochemical treatment with the aid of Si-Al-based additives. The optimized condition was determined to be a SiO2/Al ratio = 7:2 with a reagent ratio of 15:1. The optimized mechanochemical method was applied to dispose BFRs contained waste plastics. The results showed that dehalogenation of plastics occurs during mechanochemical destruction and that smaller plastic particles accelerated dehalogenation. Finally, the reaction process and intermediates were studied to provide insight into the mechanochemical degradation mechanism of HBCD, and a possible reaction pathway was proposed.
