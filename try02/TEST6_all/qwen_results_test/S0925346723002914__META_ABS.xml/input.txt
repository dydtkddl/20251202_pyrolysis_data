Pyrolyzed synthesis of boron nitride for photocatalytic degradation of indigo carmine studies A non-metal type photocatalytic layered boron nitride (BN) material was synthesized by precursor conversion hydrothermal process followed by adequate temperature pyrolysis. The characterization of BN was performed through various analytical instrumental techniques. The results show that a hexagonal crystal structure BN with a strong BN bond was formed. The photocatalytic decolorization of indigo carmine (IC) dye was examined using synthesized BN with influencing factors like time, pH, catalyst, and dye concentration under ultra-violet light (UV) illumination. The decolorization efficiency was found to be 88%. The optimization of operating parameters was investigated and also found a model equation of decolorization efficiency through response surface methodology (RSM) based box - behnken design (BBD). The photocatalytic decolorization mechanism was suggested based on the experiments performed.
