You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-catalytic dissolution of biochar in hydrogen donor solvent Cellulose and lignin, biomass model compounds, have been used to produce biochar through hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Biochars were prepared at various temperatures to investigate the effect of C/O ratio on biochar dissolution in tetralin, a hydrogen donor solvent previously used in direct coal liquefaction (DCL). In contrast with DCL, biochar dissolution was done without the use of any catalyst. All of the dissolution experiments were carried out at 400 °C to stay below the critical point of tetralin. Hydrogen from tetralin stabilizes the radicals formed during the thermal breakdown of oxygenated hydrocarbon bonds in the biochar. It was observed that the dissolution of biochar depends on (a) the HTC temperature which dictates the C/O ratio of the biochars and (b) presence of biocrude (which consists of furanic and phenolic compounds) produced during HTC. In general, low C/O ratio (obtained at low HTC temperature) and presence of biocrude greatly enhanced the dissolution of biochar in tetralin. This is because low C/O ratio contains more reactive oxygenated groups and biocrude promotes the scission of ether linkages in biochar to form phenoxy radicals which are stabilized by tetralin. A detailed mechanism of biochar dissolution in the presence of biocrude has been proposed in this study. The highest conversion of cellulose (C230, C/O = 1.1) and lignin (AL350, C/O = 3.1) biochars were observed to be 90 wt% and 75 wt% respectively.
