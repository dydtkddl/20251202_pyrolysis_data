Non-catalytic dissolution of biochar in hydrogen donor solvent Cellulose and lignin, biomass model compounds, have been used to produce biochar through hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Biochars were prepared at various temperatures to investigate the effect of C/O ratio on biochar dissolution in tetralin, a hydrogen donor solvent previously used in direct coal liquefaction (DCL). In contrast with DCL, biochar dissolution was done without the use of any catalyst. All of the dissolution experiments were carried out at 400 °C to stay below the critical point of tetralin. Hydrogen from tetralin stabilizes the radicals formed during the thermal breakdown of oxygenated hydrocarbon bonds in the biochar. It was observed that the dissolution of biochar depends on (a) the HTC temperature which dictates the C/O ratio of the biochars and (b) presence of biocrude (which consists of furanic and phenolic compounds) produced during HTC. In general, low C/O ratio (obtained at low HTC temperature) and presence of biocrude greatly enhanced the dissolution of biochar in tetralin. This is because low C/O ratio contains more reactive oxygenated groups and biocrude promotes the scission of ether linkages in biochar to form phenoxy radicals which are stabilized by tetralin. A detailed mechanism of biochar dissolution in the presence of biocrude has been proposed in this study. The highest conversion of cellulose (C230, C/O = 1.1) and lignin (AL350, C/O = 3.1) biochars were observed to be 90 wt% and 75 wt% respectively.
