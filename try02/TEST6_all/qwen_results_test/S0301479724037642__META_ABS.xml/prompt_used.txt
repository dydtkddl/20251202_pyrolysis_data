You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emerging contaminants in polluted waters: Harnessing Biochar's potential for effective treatment Biochar is a carbon-rich, sponge-like material with intricate functionalities, making it suitable for various environmental remediation applications, including water treatment, soil amendment and, additives in construction materials, anaerobic digesters, and electrodes, among others. Its easy adaptability and low cost make it particularly attractive. This review highlights a range of biochar and surface-modified biochar exhibiting high uptake and degradation efficiencies for a broad spectrum of contaminants, including humic acid, disinfection by-products (DBPs), radioactive materials, dyes, heavy metals, antibiotics, microplastics, pathogens, Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and cytotoxins. The study provides a detailed discussion on different classes of pollutants and their removal mechanisms using biochar, covering processes like physical and chemical adsorption, electrostatic interactions, π-π interactions, hydrogen bonding, as well as surface complexation, chelation, among others. This review article stands out for its comprehensive exploration of biochar's effectiveness in removing a wide range of emerging contaminants, as well as recent advancements in the removal of conventional pollutants like heavy metals and antibiotics.
