You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green production of ammonia gas and fertilizers via upcycling of soiled diapers by Zophobas morio Soiled diapers, being the third-largest single consumer item in landfills and whose plastic components are estimated to take hundreds of years to decompose, negatively impact the environment. Here, experiments reveal that Zophobas morio larvae (superworms) can consume, digest, and upcycle soiled diapers into ammonia gas and fertilizers. Remarkably, superworms consuming soiled diapers excrete ammonia gas at a rate of (10.8 ± 2.9) μg per superworm per hour, a rate that is more competitive than modern catalytic nitrogen reduction reactions. In addition, superworms’ production of ammonia gas from digesting nitrogen-containing plastic compounds increases when they consume urine in the soiled diapers. Further experiments attribute the superworms’ ability to generate ammonia to urease-producing bacteria, whose production in superworms’ gut is enhanced by the presence of environmental urea. The entire process takes place under ambient conditions, providing a more environmentally sustainable way to produce ammonia gas relative to traditional Haber-Bosch processes. Furthermore, superworms also digest soiled diapers into products similar in composition to their regular frass, which is itself a viable fertilizer, at a rate of 1.5 mg per superworm per day. A techno-economic analysis as well as a life cycle assessment reveal that the ammonia gas and fertilizer products allow for both economic viability and environmental benefits of this soiled diapers upcycling scheme.
