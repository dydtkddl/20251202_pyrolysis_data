Green production of ammonia gas and fertilizers via upcycling of soiled diapers by Zophobas morio Soiled diapers, being the third-largest single consumer item in landfills and whose plastic components are estimated to take hundreds of years to decompose, negatively impact the environment. Here, experiments reveal that Zophobas morio larvae (superworms) can consume, digest, and upcycle soiled diapers into ammonia gas and fertilizers. Remarkably, superworms consuming soiled diapers excrete ammonia gas at a rate of (10.8 ± 2.9) μg per superworm per hour, a rate that is more competitive than modern catalytic nitrogen reduction reactions. In addition, superworms’ production of ammonia gas from digesting nitrogen-containing plastic compounds increases when they consume urine in the soiled diapers. Further experiments attribute the superworms’ ability to generate ammonia to urease-producing bacteria, whose production in superworms’ gut is enhanced by the presence of environmental urea. The entire process takes place under ambient conditions, providing a more environmentally sustainable way to produce ammonia gas relative to traditional Haber-Bosch processes. Furthermore, superworms also digest soiled diapers into products similar in composition to their regular frass, which is itself a viable fertilizer, at a rate of 1.5 mg per superworm per day. A techno-economic analysis as well as a life cycle assessment reveal that the ammonia gas and fertilizer products allow for both economic viability and environmental benefits of this soiled diapers upcycling scheme.
