You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards sustainable approach of the waste tyres employment in water pollutant sequestrations Worldwide population growth has considerably increased the use of automobiles, which has raised serious concerns about the production of vast quantities of waste tyres (WT) and subsequent disposal problems. When WT builds up in the environment without proper recycling strategies, toxic repercussions in various forms increase. The practice of clearing waste through open air burning has been abandoned, and it poses major risks to human health and atmospheric pollution. Reuse of WT is accomplished via several recycling techniques. The WT pyrolysis approach is discussed in this review, which is described as a thermochemical process carried out at high temperature to convert WT mainly into charcoal, a material used as an adsorbent agent. In addition to this solid portion, pyrolysis produces liquid and gas fractions, all influenced by the conditions of the pyrolysis process. This review provides a cutting-edge critical appraisal of studies on adsorbents made from char generated during pyrolysis and its use in the sequestration of pollutants from wastewater. In summary, this review on the WT pyrolysis focuses a promising approach to addressing disposal challenges, lowering harmful environmental impacts, and proposing an effective solution for removing pollutants from water.
