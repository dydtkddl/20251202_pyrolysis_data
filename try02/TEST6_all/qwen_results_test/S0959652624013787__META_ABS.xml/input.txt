Towards sustainable approach of the waste tyres employment in water pollutant sequestrations Worldwide population growth has considerably increased the use of automobiles, which has raised serious concerns about the production of vast quantities of waste tyres (WT) and subsequent disposal problems. When WT builds up in the environment without proper recycling strategies, toxic repercussions in various forms increase. The practice of clearing waste through open air burning has been abandoned, and it poses major risks to human health and atmospheric pollution. Reuse of WT is accomplished via several recycling techniques. The WT pyrolysis approach is discussed in this review, which is described as a thermochemical process carried out at high temperature to convert WT mainly into charcoal, a material used as an adsorbent agent. In addition to this solid portion, pyrolysis produces liquid and gas fractions, all influenced by the conditions of the pyrolysis process. This review provides a cutting-edge critical appraisal of studies on adsorbents made from char generated during pyrolysis and its use in the sequestration of pollutants from wastewater. In summary, this review on the WT pyrolysis focuses a promising approach to addressing disposal challenges, lowering harmful environmental impacts, and proposing an effective solution for removing pollutants from water.
