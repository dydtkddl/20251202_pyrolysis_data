You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic degradation of linear low-density polyethylene over HY-zeolite via pre-degradation method The catalytic degradation of linear low-density (lldPE) polyethylene over HY-zeolite catalyst was studied in a semi-batch reactor. One of the important problems encountered during catalytic pyrolysis of macromolecules is the contact with the catalyst, which is known to affect the product distribution and the quality of the coke formed. A pre-degradation procedure was introduced to achieve efficient contact between the LLDPE macromolecules and the catalyst. The influence of the pre-degradation to the reaction conditions including holding time, temperature, polymer to catalyst ratio and flow rate of carrier gas was examined. Moreover, the pre-degradation results were compared with the results obtained using normal mixing procedure. The results obtained showed that, pre-degradation promotes the liquid fraction by a factor of more than one-fold increase at the expense of the gas fraction and the coke yield. The optimal liquid fraction with pre-degradation was obtained at low reaction temperature and catalyst amount respectively, i.e. high polymer to catalyst ratio, making it economically viable method for the degradation of lldPE. The coke content was analysed using TGA in nitrogen atmosphere to remove the soft coke and then in air isothermally at the final temperature to burn the hard coke. The TGA results of the coked sample show less concentration of coke components on the catalyst using the pre-degradation method as compared to the normal mixing which shows high concentration of coke components especially at low reaction temperature. Moreover, the majority of the coke components produced using the pre-degradation method were soft coke, making it more efficient for the re-usability of the catalyst. The liquid samples collected were analysed using gas chromatography and the products distribution were presented in the form of boiling point distribution curves. The bulk of the liquid products produced were lighter fractions with a peak around the gasoline range.
