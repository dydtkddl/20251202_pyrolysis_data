You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorptive removal of tetracycline from aqueous solution by maple leaf-derived biochar The present study evaluates the physicochemical properties of maple leaf-derived biochars (M-BCs) produced at different pyrolytic temperatures (i.e., 350, 550, and 750 °C) and their adsorptive properties for tetracycline onto M-BCs. The increase in pyrolysis temperature to produce M-BCs led to a significant increase in the biochar’s hydrophobicity, surface area, and calcite (CaCO3) crystallization. The M-BC750 produced without functionalization or activation possessed a high calcite composition and a hydrophobic nature with lower O/C and H/C, hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the surface, and functional groups (i.e., O-containing) as H-bond acceptors. Among M-BCs, the M-BC750 present a highest TC adsorption capacity owing to possible mechanisms such as metal complexation, H-bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. The isotherm and kinetic models for TC adsorption followed the Freundlich models and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. M-BCs produced from the waste fallen maple leaves could be applied as low-cost environmental adsorbents for TC removal.
