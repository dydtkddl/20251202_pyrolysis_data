Biochar as environmental armour and its diverse role towards protecting soil, water and air Biochar has been of considerable importance for various environmental applications in recent years. It has exhibited substantial advantages like favourable structural and surface properties, easy process of preparation and widely available feedstocks. These set of exceptional properties make it an efficient, cost-effective and environment friendly source for diversified elimination of pollutants. The heterogeneity of physico-chemical properties offers a possibility for biochar to optimize its efficacy for targeted applications. This review aims to highlight the critical role that biochar plays in various environmental applications, be it in soil, water or air. In particular the article offers a comprehensive review of the recent research findings and updates related to the diversified role of biochar. Also, the interaction of pollutants with biochar functional groups and the impact of variation of parameters on biochar attribute relevant to specific pollutant removal, modifications, mechanisms involved and competence for such removal has been discussed. Different technologies for production of biochar have also been summarized with an emphasis on post treatment of biochar, such as modification and doping. In addition to this, the underlying gaps in the studies carried out so far and recommendations for future research areas in biochar have also been deliberated.
