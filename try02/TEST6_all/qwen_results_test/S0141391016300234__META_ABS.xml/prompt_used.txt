You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Accelerated weathering studies on the bioplastic, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) The effect of accelerated weathering exposure time on the bioplastic, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) was studied. The chemical structure and thermophysical property changes of solvent cast PHBV films were examined by a combination of optical microscopy, size exclusion chromatography, FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopies, tensile testing, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The exposed PHBV surfaces experienced surface crazing upon weathering. The molar mass of weathered PHBV was shown to decrease due to chain scission which was dominant over the crosslinking reaction mechanism, and compositional analysis showed the polymer degradation was non-random between the hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate units. The degree of crystallinity for PHBV was shown to increase significantly (by about 20%) upon weathering. Tensile tests showed that the weathered PHBV exhibited reduced ultimate strength and elongation to break, while the Young's modulus increased ascribing to an increase in crystallinity. Different degradation mechanisms (Norrish I/II, radical initiation, crosslinking, and hydrolysis) of PHBV are proposed and confirmed based on the experimental findings. This study provides degradation insight for PHBV exposed to both UV radiation and moisture.
