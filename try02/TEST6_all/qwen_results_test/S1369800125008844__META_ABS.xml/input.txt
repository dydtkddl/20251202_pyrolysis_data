Assessing the potential and challenges of Graphene in optoelectronic applications: A comprehensive review The transparency, mechanical flexibility, and electrical conductivity of graphene make it a suitable material for transparent electrodes (TEs) in optoelectronic devices. This work investigates the development of graphene-based TEs, including their fabrication, properties, and optoelectronic applications. Discussions of developments in doping methods, chemical vapor deposition, and hybrid material systems are included. Recent research has shown that doping, transfer methods, and multi-layer stacking have significantly improved graphene's performance, resulting in sheet resistances below 60 Ω/sq and optical transmittance above 90 %. The potential of replacing conventional transparent electrodes, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), with graphene is also discussed. Applications in various optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodiodes, demonstrate graphene's versatility as a flexible and wearable structure in these systems. Future directions require overcoming contact resistance and regulatory constraints to achieve commercial readiness, while also emphasizing scalable, defect-free production and optimization of applications in optoelectronic devices.
