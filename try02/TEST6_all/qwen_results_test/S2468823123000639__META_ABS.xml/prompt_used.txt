You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading catalytic efficiency of activated carbons by tailoring lignocellulosic biomass waste for sustainable conversion of glycerol to solketal This study introduces a novel strategy for boosting both surface acidic properties and textural features of a series of activated carbons from petiole of Mauritia flexuosa Linnaeus fillius, a lignocellulosic biomass waste. The structure, state and concentration of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose into the selected precursor underwent a reconfiguration protocol aiming at tunning surface features of the carbons-based catalyst chemically activated with H3PO4. In fact, the modified precursors gave rise to activated carbons that boast surface area of up to 2349 m2.g−1 and total acidity ranging from 2.22 to 3.13 mmol.g−1, making them suitable candidate to promote the conversion of glycerol to solketal. The catalysts were successfully applied in the solvent-free acetalization of glycerol with acetone achieving glycerol conversion higher than 83% (selectivity around 98% toward solketal) with remarkable turnover frequencies as well as a notable reusability in consecutive runs. Further, it was noticed that the diversity of acid strength of the reactive sites played an important role in each step of the reaction mechanism synergically improving catalytic performance. The physicochemical and surface chemistry properties of the activated carbons were characterized by means of N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, thermal analysis, elemental analysis, surface functional groups titration, X-rays diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy.
