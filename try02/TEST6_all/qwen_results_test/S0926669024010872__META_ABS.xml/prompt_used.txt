You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of combustible gas via incorporating CO2 to pyrolysis of medicinal herbal waste With the recent increase in the utilization of medicinal herbs, the generation of medicinal herbal waste has increased. However, conventional protocols for solid waste management (landfill and incineration) present environmental threats considering the complex chemical composition of medicinal herbal waste. Thus, this study introduces a thermochemical approach for managing medicinal herbal waste, focusing on conversion of red ginseng marc (RGM) into energy resource. This study explores an innovative strategy to maximize the production of pyrogenic gases using CO2 form improved syngas generation. The experimental results revealed an enhancement in CO from the pyrolysis of RGM under the CO2 condition in reference with the N2 condition, which was ascribed to gas-phased homogeneous reaction of CO2 with volatile matters liberated from RGM. Moreover, gas-phase reactions have proven to be effective in decreasing the benzene analogs, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in pyrogenic liquids. To accelerate the gas-phase reaction rate, a nickel (Ni)-based catalyst was employed for the RGM pyrolysis. The introduction of Ni catalyst to the gas-phase reaction led to an CO enhancement (272 %) from the RGM pyrolysis in the presence of CO2. All experimental observations highlight the potential of incorporating CO2 in thermochemical conversion of RGM as an innovative way to enhance energy recovery.
