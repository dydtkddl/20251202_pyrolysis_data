Polyreactions in miniemulsions Miniemulsions are specially formulated heterophase systems where stable nanodroplets of one phase are dispersed in a second, continuous phase. It is delineated that miniemulsions rely on the appropriate combination of saturated high shear treatment, surfactants, and the presence of an osmotic pressure agent insoluble in the continuous phase. The droplet diameter is adjusted by the type and amount of surfactant, the volume fraction of disperse phase, and the general dispersion problem and lies between 30 and 500nm. Since each of those droplets can be regarded as an individual batch reactor, a whole variety of polymerization reactions can be performed starting from miniemulsions, clearly extending the profile of classical emulsion polymerization. This article gives an overview about the mechanisms of formation of and polymerization in miniemulsions and reviews the current standing of the field for both the synthesis of new polymers and disperses hybrid systems from heterophase situations.
