You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of cyclic carbonates by CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides: recent advances, challenges and perspectives The catalytic conversion of CO2 into functionalized chemical products has evolved into a pivotal scientific frontier, garnering substantial research investment from multidisciplinary domains. Among diverse transformation pathways, the atomically economical cycloaddition between CO2 and epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates stands out as a paradigm of sustainable synthesis, fully complying with green chemistry metrics and circular economy principles. These value-added cyclic carbonates serve as critical components in advanced energy storage systems (e.g., lithium-ion battery electrolytes), bioactive molecule synthesis, and specialty chemical production. This critical review systematically explores recent progress, technical barriers, and strategic directions within CO2 cycloaddition research. The analysis commences with a mechanistic dissection of three predominant activation modes (CO2 activation, epoxides activation, and dual activation), subsequently conducting comparative assessments of catalytic systems spanning molecular complexes to heterogeneous frameworks. A techno-economic evaluation is then presented regarding reactor configurations, including batch processing, continuous flow systems, and microchannel technologies. Notably, the work emphasizes an urgent need for innovative catalytic materials capable of dual-functionality: selective adsorption of dilute CO2 streams from industrial flue gases or ambient air under mild conditions (25 °C, 1 atm), coupled with in situ catalytic transformation into target carbonates without intermediate separation. The proposed research matrix establishes theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for developing next-generation carbon capture-utilization integrated technologies.
