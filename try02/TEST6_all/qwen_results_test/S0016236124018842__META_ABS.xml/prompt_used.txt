You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the co-pyrolysis interactions and chlorine migration behaviors of polyvinyl chloride and Hami coal Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and low-rank coal is an effective way to realize resource recycling, while the chlorides released during the co-pyrolysis process would corrode the equipment and affect the product quality. Therefore, the synergistic effect and chlorine migration behavior of co-pyrolysis for Hami (HM) coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied through in situ pyrolysis time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-TOF-MS) and fix-bed experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC polymer (PVC-PO)/PVC pipes (PVC-P) and HM coal exhibits different synergistic effects on the co-pyrolysis products. The results of Py-TOF-MS suggested that co-pyrolysis promotes the reactions between small molecular fragments and the secondary reactions between volatiles, which accelerates the generation of MAHs and PAHs. However, the addition of HM coal inhibits the generation of polyene fragments and aromatics. These two effects are competitive for the aromatization reactions. Moreover, the additives in PVC-P improve the tar quality and lead to more than 0.86–1.82 % of the chlorine being fixed in co-pyrolysis char. Co-pyrolysis inhibits the release of HCl and results in a migration of chlorine from the gas phase to the solid/liquid phase. 7:3 is a suitable mixing ratio to fix chlorine, which provides guidance for the targeted regulation of chlorine.
