Study on the co-pyrolysis interactions and chlorine migration behaviors of polyvinyl chloride and Hami coal Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and low-rank coal is an effective way to realize resource recycling, while the chlorides released during the co-pyrolysis process would corrode the equipment and affect the product quality. Therefore, the synergistic effect and chlorine migration behavior of co-pyrolysis for Hami (HM) coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied through in situ pyrolysis time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-TOF-MS) and fix-bed experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC polymer (PVC-PO)/PVC pipes (PVC-P) and HM coal exhibits different synergistic effects on the co-pyrolysis products. The results of Py-TOF-MS suggested that co-pyrolysis promotes the reactions between small molecular fragments and the secondary reactions between volatiles, which accelerates the generation of MAHs and PAHs. However, the addition of HM coal inhibits the generation of polyene fragments and aromatics. These two effects are competitive for the aromatization reactions. Moreover, the additives in PVC-P improve the tar quality and lead to more than 0.86–1.82 % of the chlorine being fixed in co-pyrolysis char. Co-pyrolysis inhibits the release of HCl and results in a migration of chlorine from the gas phase to the solid/liquid phase. 7:3 is a suitable mixing ratio to fix chlorine, which provides guidance for the targeted regulation of chlorine.
