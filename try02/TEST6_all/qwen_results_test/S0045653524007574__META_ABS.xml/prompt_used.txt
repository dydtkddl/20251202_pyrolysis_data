You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel approach for the facile synthesis of zinc oxide/carbon hybrid systems from corn distillers soluble: Surface modification and characterization for sustainable remediation Sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly ways to tailor the carbonaceous materials from bio sources with desired functionalities remain a challenge around the world. In this study, we represent a novel approach to synthesize carbon hybrid material based on Zinc Oxide/carbon (ZnO/C) hybrid systems by catalytic hydrothermal process via crosslinking reaction through nucleation and growth of ZnO particles at the functional groups of oxidized carbon material. This research explored the volarization of Condensed Corn Distillers Soluble (CDS) as a carbon precursor to synthesize biobased carbon spheres. Surface modification of the produced carbon spheres took place using zinc chloride (ZnCl2) during hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) was used to function as a catalyst during HTC and functioned as a ZnO source to synthesize (ZnO/C) hybrid systems. Design Expert software v13 was used to design the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) experiments and response surface methodology was used to find the optimized conditions for the preparation of carbon hybrid systems. The hydrothermal synthesis process introduced 3D stone like zinc oxide particles onto the carbon matrix. These particles were self-assembled onto the carbon framework to produce carbon hybrid systems with unique physical, chemical, structural and functional properties. Herein, the obtained carbon hybrid systems (ZnO/C) were investigated and discussed in detail. ZnO/C hybrid systems were analyzed for surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that presented a 3D spherical interconnected phase and XRD analyses were used for phase crystallinity that showed new crystalline phases such as hopeite and zincite after the ZnCl2 incorporation. Surface functional groups were also analyzed by FTIR and results confirmed the presence of hydrophilic groups such as –OH, CC, and COOH on the surface of ZnO/C hybrid carbon systems. This study provided the insightful guidance for tailoring novel design of multifunctional carbon material as an adsorbent/catalyst for various applications of sustainable remediation.
