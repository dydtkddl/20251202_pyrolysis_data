You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Temperature stable, polymeric thin-film composite membrane for hydrogen separation The high temperatures and aggressive chemical conditions of many relevant industrial processes such as the hydrogen production from hydrocarbon fuel sources restrict the use of polymeric membranes for gas separations (GS) that could make such processes more efficient and environmentally friendlier whilst reducing their operational costs. Therefore, this work was centered on the development of a thin-film composite membrane (TFCM) prepared with high-performance polymeric materials capable of withstanding temperatures above 200 °C in industrial GS applications and which could eventually be integrated to perform in situ separations in a reactor. An innovative prototypical three-layered TFCM featuring the polyimide 6FDA-6FpDA as selective layer deposited on a cross-linked (CL) Matrimid® 5218 (Matrimid) porous support prepared on a thermally stable polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) nonwoven was investigated in two different gas permeation experimental facilities in a range from 30 to 200 °C and feed pressures of up to 10 bar. The TFCM exhibited low permeances compensated by outstanding ideal selectivities for H2/CO2, H2/CH4 and O2/N2 gas pairs. This behavior was attributed to the formation of an interpenetrating network between 6FDA-6FpDA and Matrimid, caused by a swelling effect of the solvent used to form the selective layer on the surface of the cross-linked Matrimid porous membrane. A drop in membrane performance was observed above 170 °C due to a reduction in the thermal stability of the CL Matrimid resulting from the opening of the imide rings of the polyimide backbone during the cross-linking reaction.
