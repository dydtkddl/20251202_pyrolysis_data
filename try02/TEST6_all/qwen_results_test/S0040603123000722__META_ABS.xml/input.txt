Thermogravimetric approach to efflorescence of sodium carbonate decahydrate The efflorescence of sodium carbonate decahydrate (SC-DH), characterized by the solid-state thermal dehydration to form its monohydrate (SC-MH), occurs below its melting point positioned slightly above room temperature and at a lower atmospheric water vapor pressure (p(H2O)). Applying a thermogravimetry (TG) that covers temperatures lower than room temperature enabled us to systematically trace the efflorescence of SC-DH under various heating programs in a dry N2 stream, using which the kinetics of the efflorescence was formally described by the basic kinetic equation. Meanwhile, when the sample temperature reached the melting point of SC-DH midway through the efflorescence process, the thermal dehydration switched from solid-state mode to liquid-state one and exhibited a complex multistep mass loss behavior to form SC-MH. The multistep mass loss behavior and its changes with the reaction conditions were overviewed using a humidity-controlled TG at various atmospheric p(H2O).
