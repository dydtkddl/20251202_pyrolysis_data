You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing aerobic oxidation of C–H bonds through efficient catalysis of iron MOF–derived Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon catalysts Developing efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of C–H bonds using oxygen molecule as an oxidant to produce value–added aryl ketones is a challenging task. In this study, a series of cementite–iron–carbon composites (referred to as Fe–C–T, where T represents the pyrolysis temperature) were synthesized using a metal–organic–framework–mediated sacrificial template strategy. The Fe–C–T composites consist of highly dispersed Fe/(Fe3C or Fe2O3) nanoparticles surrounded by graphitic carbon on porous carbon supports. Under mild reaction conditions (1 atm of O2 pressure, 353 K, 12 h), with tert–butyl hydroperoxide (0.25 equiv.) as the initiator in a green solvent water, the prepared Fe–C–973 achieved a high conversion of 98.4 % for ethylbenzene and a selectivity of 98.7 % for acetophenone. This performance was markedly superior to the comparable Fe–C–873 and Fe–C–1073, as well as the commercially available Fe–based catalysts. Kinetic studies revealed that the catalytic system followed first–order kinetics for the substrate ethylbenzene, and the activation energy over Fe–C–973 was remarkably low of 40.4 kJ/mol. The highly distributed Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in the porous carbon framework were identified as the most active sites for the reaction.
