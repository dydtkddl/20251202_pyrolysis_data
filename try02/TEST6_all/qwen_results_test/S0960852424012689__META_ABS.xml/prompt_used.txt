You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Promoting effects of bioplastics and sludge anaerobic co-fermentation for carboxylates production with pH regulation: Insights into the plastic structure, microbial metabolic traits, and adaptive mechanism Biodegradable plastics (BPs) are presenting new challenges for their reutilization. This work found that volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production by co-fermentation of BPs with waste activated sludge (WAS) reached 4–37 times of the WAS fermentation alone, which was further amplified by pH regulation (especially alkaline regulation). Moreover, the VFAs composition is highly associated with BPs category. By contrast, the traditional plastic showed a limited effect on the VFAs yield and composition. Alkaline regulation enhanced the breakdown of BPs’ ester bonds and boosted WAS disintegration, increasing bioavailable substrates. The hydrolytic-acidogenic anaerobes (i.e., Serpentinicella and Proteiniclasticum) and the major metabolic processes participated in the transformation of BPs and WAS to VFAs were upregulated under alkaline conditions. Further exploration unveiled that quorum sensing and peptidoglycan synthesis played important roles in counteracting alkaline stress and maintaining microbial activity for effective VFAs generation. The works demonstrated the effectiveness of pH-regulated anaerobic co-fermentation for BPs valorization.
