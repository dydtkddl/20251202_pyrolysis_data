Promoting effects of bioplastics and sludge anaerobic co-fermentation for carboxylates production with pH regulation: Insights into the plastic structure, microbial metabolic traits, and adaptive mechanism Biodegradable plastics (BPs) are presenting new challenges for their reutilization. This work found that volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production by co-fermentation of BPs with waste activated sludge (WAS) reached 4–37 times of the WAS fermentation alone, which was further amplified by pH regulation (especially alkaline regulation). Moreover, the VFAs composition is highly associated with BPs category. By contrast, the traditional plastic showed a limited effect on the VFAs yield and composition. Alkaline regulation enhanced the breakdown of BPs’ ester bonds and boosted WAS disintegration, increasing bioavailable substrates. The hydrolytic-acidogenic anaerobes (i.e., Serpentinicella and Proteiniclasticum) and the major metabolic processes participated in the transformation of BPs and WAS to VFAs were upregulated under alkaline conditions. Further exploration unveiled that quorum sensing and peptidoglycan synthesis played important roles in counteracting alkaline stress and maintaining microbial activity for effective VFAs generation. The works demonstrated the effectiveness of pH-regulated anaerobic co-fermentation for BPs valorization.
