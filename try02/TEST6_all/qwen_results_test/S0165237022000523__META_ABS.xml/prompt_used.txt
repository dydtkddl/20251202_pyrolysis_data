You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An analysis of hydrogen production potential through the in-line oxidative steam reforming of different pyrolysis volatiles Fast pyrolysis combined with oxidative steam-reforming is an attractive approach for the large scale production of renewable H2. Although O2 addition contributes to reducing energy requirements and coke formation on the catalyst surface, its presence in the reaction environment negatively impacts H2 production with a reduction up to 24% under autothermal conditions. Therefore, the combined impact of the main reaction parameters needs to be studied. Accordingly, a thermodynamic study has been carried out of the oxidative steam-reforming of pyrolysis volatile streams derived from various organic wastes. The thermodynamic model was validated with experimental data and used to evaluate the combined effect of temperature, steam to feedstock ratio and oxygen content on the reaction enthalpy, hydrogen production and other by-product composition. The results show that the most influential parameter is the steam partial pressure, followed by oxygen content and temperature. The composition of the pyrolysis volatile stream is another variable with great impact on the H2 production and energy requirement in the reforming process. Correlations were also proposed to foresee hydrogen yield, reaction enthalpy and amount of O2 to reach autothermal operation based on the C, O, H and N contents of the biomass volatile stream.
