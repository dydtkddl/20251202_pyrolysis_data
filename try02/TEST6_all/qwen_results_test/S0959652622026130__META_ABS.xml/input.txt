Turning problem into possibility: A comprehensive review on leather solid waste intra-valorization attempts for leather processing The leather processing industry generates huge quantum of solid wastes than the main product leather while processing animal hides/skins for leather making. The pollution caused by the present inefficient disposal (via incineration and landfilling) of these solid wastes impedes the industry's path towards sustainable growth. Hence, it is imperative that alternative technological interventions that harness value from these wastes should be followed in line with the principles of circular economy. The present review opines that the leather solid wastes are indeed a treasure trove, which can be promptly utilized for the benefit of leather industry, while closing the loop. With such objective, the review paper provides a holistic perspective on solid waste intra-valorization for leather process unit processing viz. pre-tanning, tanning, post-tanning, finishing and effluent treatment. Secondarily, the multifarious application potential of these solid wastes for other industries has also been extensively reviewed. The environmental and economic benefits of solid waste management in this direction will provide lead to successfully implement circular economy (CE) model in leather industry for a sustainable tomorrow. This review will guide the researchers, scholars and authorized stakeholders to work towards changing the face of leather solid wastes from an obstacle to an opportunity.
