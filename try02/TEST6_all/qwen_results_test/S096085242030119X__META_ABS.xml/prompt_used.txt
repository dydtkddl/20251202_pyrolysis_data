You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of pyrolysis temperature on chemical speciation, leaching ability, and environmental risk of heavy metals in biochar derived from cow manure This study analyzed the chemical speciation, leaching ability, and environmental risk of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in cow manure biochar (CMBC) pyrolyzed at various temperatures. The total content, chemical speciation, and leaching ability of the heavy metals were determined through microwave digestion, modified BCR three-step sequential extraction procedure, and leaching solution systems (TCLP, distilled water, and SPLP). The risk assessment code, Muller geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk index, and germination index were used to evaluate the environmental safety and ecotoxicity of heavy metals. Significant differences were observed in the physicochemical properties of CMBCs. The heavy metal contents in CMBCs were higher than those in CM. The bioavailable fraction of heavy metals was transformed into a relatively stable fraction with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore, the potential risks and ecotoxicity of biochar were reduced, thus improving environmental safety. The study results provide important data for biochar applications.
