Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of a real mixture of post-consumer plastic waste: An analysis of the gasoline-range product In this work, the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of different types of plastic waste and a real mixture were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor over different catalysts (CaO, MgO, HY, HZSM-5). Important differences in gas, liquid, and solid yields were found as a function of polymer type. The highest gas yield was obtained with expanded polystyrene (52.3%), and the maximum oil production with high-impact polystyrene (55.5%), while polypropylene film led to the highest char release (17.5%). Regarding the composition of the liquid oil, high-impact polystyrene showed the highest yield of gasoline-range product (426 g per kg of pyrolyzed plastic), mainly composed of aromatics compounds (90%). The addition of catalysts increased the gas yield to the detriment of the oil produced. The effect was more evident for zeolite-type catalysts, i.e., the gas yield raised from 43.3 (non-catalytic) to 51.5% (HZSM-5). Low influence on the oil composition, i.e., gasoline-range product, was detected. This can be explained by the fast deactivation of catalysts because of coke deposition. Only an increase in the fraction of gasoline in liquid oil was observed when low-cost catalysts (CaO and MgO) were used, without significant changes in the composition of this product.
