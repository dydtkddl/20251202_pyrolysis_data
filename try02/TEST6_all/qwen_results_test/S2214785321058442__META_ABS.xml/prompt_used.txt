You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of alternative liquid fuels from catalytic hydrocracking of plastics over Ni/SBA-15 catalyst The extremely increasing amount of plastic waste due to the development of human society, economics and urbanization is an emergency task that must be urgently handled in order to reduce environmental problems. Although the plastic wastes can be converted to alternative liquid fuels through pyrolysis process, the compositions in the pyrolysis oil depended on the chemical structure of raw materials and pyrolysis condition affect its quality. Thus, this research aimed to comparatively investigate the production of alternative liquid fuels obtained from mixed plastics containing polystyrene (PS)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) at 20/5/35/40 (w/w) via non-catalytic cracking (under N2 atmosphere), non-catalytic hydrocracking (under H2 atmosphere), and catalytic hydrocracking over 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst conducted at an atmospheric pressure and 650 °C for 1 h. The product yields and chemical compositions (paraffins, olefins, aromatics and PAHs) in the liquid products generated from these processes were investigated and also compared to ones obtained from the non-catalytic processes of each plastic. Herein, the characteristics of 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was analyzed by N2-adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The results indicated that the non-catalytic processes of PS provided the highest content of oil and wax product (ca. 92 wt%). Whereas, the non-catalytic hydrocracking of the mixed plastics gave the lowest one (ca. 69 wt%). However, the catalytic hydrocracking over 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst (2.5 – 10.0 wt% based on the mixed plastics) could suppress the cracking and yielded the higher amount of oil and wax to ca. 76–80 wt%. To consider the chemical compositions in the liquid phase, the PAHs formation was relied on the aromatic structure in the feedstocks. The liquid product derived from the non-catalytic processes of PS contained the highest amount of PAHs compounds (2622–2926 ppm) followed by the mixed plastics. When the 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was applied to the catalytic hydrocracking of the mixed plastics, the amount of PAHs in the liquid product decreased from 1621 ppm to ca. 1000 ppm (30 – 40% PAHs reduction) without the reduction of heating value when compared to one obtained from the non-catalytic processes.
