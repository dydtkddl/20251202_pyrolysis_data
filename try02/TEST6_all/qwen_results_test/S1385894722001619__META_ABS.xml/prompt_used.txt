You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective solvent extraction and quantification of synthetic microfibers in textile laundry wastewater using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry This paper reports a new qualification and quantification method for synthetic microfibers (MFs), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon-6 (N-6), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), emitted from textiles during the laundering process by applying a sequential process involving the filtration of laundry wastewater, solvent extraction with hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). After filtering the textile laundry wastewater, selective sampling of synthetic MFs excluding non-target matrices and natural fibers was achieved by extracting the filtered samples with HFIP. MF recovery for HFIP extraction by Py-GC/MS analysis was 91.4 %, 98.5 %, and 98.8 % for PET, N-6, and PAN, respectively. The calibration curves obtained from Py-GC/MS analysis for PET, N-6, and PAN in the weight range between 1 and 50 μg showed good linearity (R2 > 0.994). The detection and quantification limits were lower than 0.2 μg and 0.6 μg for all polymers. The quantification results for the MFs extracted from the textile made from a single filer indicated that PET, N-6, and PAN textile produced 481, 111, and 329 mg of MFs/kg textile, respectively. Compared to the single textile (PET), the blended textiles produced larger amounts of MPs, 961 mg/kg for PET/cotton and 680 mg/kg for PET/wool blended textiles, suggesting the easier formation of MFs from blended textiles during textile laundering.
