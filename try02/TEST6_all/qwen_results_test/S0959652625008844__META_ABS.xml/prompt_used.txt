You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride and corn stalk for improved products and dechlorination behavior Efficient strategies for the environmentally safe utilization of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are crucial to minimizing its environmental impact. This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of PVC and corn stalk in an infrared heating reactor to enhance product quality and mitigate hydrochloric acid (HCl) formation. The process exhibited significant synergy, improving oil yield and chlorine retention in char. At 700 °C with 25 % PVC, oil yield increased by 12.66 %, while GC-MS analysis revealed a 17.51 % rise in aromatic compounds, accompanied by reductions of 29.30 % in aliphatic compounds, 10.43 % in nitrogen-containing compounds, and 2.17 % in chlorine-containing compounds. Co-pyrolysis promoted the cyclization of olefins from corn stalk, enhancing aromatic production. Chlorine distribution analysis showed that up to 72 % of chlorine was retained in the char at 500 °C, while HCl emissions were significantly reduced by 84 % at 700 °C. XPS and XRD results confirmed that K2O in corn stalk reacted with HCl to form KCl, effectively trapping chlorine in the char. These findings demonstrate that co-pyrolysis offers a promising approach for sustainable PVC recycling with reduced HCl emissions and enhanced oil quality.
