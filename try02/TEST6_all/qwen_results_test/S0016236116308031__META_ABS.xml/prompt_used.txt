You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of Cu addition as a promoter on Re/SiO2 catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation of 2-methoxyphenol as a model bio oil compound The promoting effect of Cu on Re/SiO2 catalysts was studied for guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation. Cu(x)Re/SiO2 catalysts containing from 0 to 1.91wt% Cu and 13wt% of Re were prepared by successive wet impregnation and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen sorption, CO chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and surface acidity techniques. Batch reactions were carried out at 300°C and 5MPa of H2. The Cu(x)Re/SiO2 catalysts displayed higher activities than the Re/SiO2 catalyst with a maximum activity at 1.58wt% Cu. At loadings above 1.5wt%, aggregate formation and a loss of metallic Re active sites lead to a decreased activity. The increase of the activity was attributed not only to Cu increasing the Re reducibility, but also to Cu somehow increasing the metallic Re active sites favoring guaiacol conversion. All catalysts displayed the same product distribution, confirming that the Cu in the Cu(x)Re/SiO2 not change the nature of the active site in the metallic Re nanoparticles.
