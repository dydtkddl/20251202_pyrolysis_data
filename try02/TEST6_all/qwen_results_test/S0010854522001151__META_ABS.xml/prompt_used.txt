You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of metal-organic framework architectures with macroscopic size: A review Metal-organic framework (MOFs) are potentially attractive porous materials for many industrial applications; however, they are not necessarily suitable for industrial scale implementations. MOFs are typically produced as polydisperse microcrystalline powders. Industrial applicability of MOF powders is limited by their mechanical, chemical and attrition resistance, mass transfer limitations, and/or poor handling properties. Formulating MOFs in macroscopic architectures is an essential step towards their successful implementations at industrial level. In this comprehensive Review, we extensively describe the most popular synthesis methods of macroscopic MOF architectures: mechanical densification, coordination replication, sol–gel approach, Pickering emulsion method, and 3D printing technology. The main objective of this Review is to systematize our knowledge about the synthesis methods of macroscopic MOF architectures. A thorough understanding of these synthesis techniques is expected to facilitate the preparation of innovative macroscopic MOF architectures. The excellent performance of macroscopic MOF architectures in comparison to polydisperse microcrystalline MOF powders is also revealed throughout the Review. Finally, we outline the advantages and drawbacks of each synthesis approach.
