A novel free radical mechanism based model for predicting gasification metrics and synergistic interactions in supercritical water gasification of plastics This study presents a novel supercritical water gasification (SCWG) model capable of predicting the gasification behavior of diverse plastics and their mixtures at temperatures above 600 °C. The model incorporates an extensive set of elementary gasification reactions adapted from combustion-driven free radical mechanisms, including AramcoMech 1.3, KAUST PAH Mech 2, and KAUST GS Mech 1, with additional optimized pathways. The model successfully predicts key gasification metrics such as hydrogen yield, gas yield, carbon efficiency (CE), and gasification efficiency (GE) across a range of plastics, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonates (PC), polyformaldehyde (POX), and their mixtures. Results show that polyolefins (PE, PP) primarily produce methane, while PS achieves high hydrogen yields via radical-induced aromatic bond cleavage. Oxygen-rich plastics like PET have high gasification efficiency and reduced tar formation. The model further reveals complex synergistic and antagonistic effects in plastic mixtures, with synergism observed in PE–PET blends and concentration-dependent interactions in PE–PS and POX–PP systems. Comparative energy analysis demonstrates that SCWG outperforms steam gasification in both energy and carbon efficiencies. The model validated predictions provide a robust framework for optimizing sustainable plastic gasification, feedstock blending, and plastic waste valorization under supercritical water conditions.
