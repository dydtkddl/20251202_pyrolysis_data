You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel free radical mechanism based model for predicting gasification metrics and synergistic interactions in supercritical water gasification of plastics This study presents a novel supercritical water gasification (SCWG) model capable of predicting the gasification behavior of diverse plastics and their mixtures at temperatures above 600 °C. The model incorporates an extensive set of elementary gasification reactions adapted from combustion-driven free radical mechanisms, including AramcoMech 1.3, KAUST PAH Mech 2, and KAUST GS Mech 1, with additional optimized pathways. The model successfully predicts key gasification metrics such as hydrogen yield, gas yield, carbon efficiency (CE), and gasification efficiency (GE) across a range of plastics, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonates (PC), polyformaldehyde (POX), and their mixtures. Results show that polyolefins (PE, PP) primarily produce methane, while PS achieves high hydrogen yields via radical-induced aromatic bond cleavage. Oxygen-rich plastics like PET have high gasification efficiency and reduced tar formation. The model further reveals complex synergistic and antagonistic effects in plastic mixtures, with synergism observed in PE–PET blends and concentration-dependent interactions in PE–PS and POX–PP systems. Comparative energy analysis demonstrates that SCWG outperforms steam gasification in both energy and carbon efficiencies. The model validated predictions provide a robust framework for optimizing sustainable plastic gasification, feedstock blending, and plastic waste valorization under supercritical water conditions.
