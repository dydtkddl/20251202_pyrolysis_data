You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the deactivation of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil The deactivation mechanism of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO) was investigated. The accelerated deactivation experiment of catalyst was performed with model oil containing different impurities, and results indicated that the deactivation of catalyst was related to chlorides, nitrides, and sulfides in WPPO. By changing the concentration of chloride, the interactions between the three impurities were studied. Combined with the characterization results of fresh and spent catalysts, chloride was the direct cause of the deactivation of the catalyst. Chlorine atoms in chlorides were converted into HCl gas in hydrotreating, which reacted with Ni active sites, resulting in the sintering of the average Ni particle size from 52.62 nm to 139.63 nm, and the loss of Ni active components by 3–8 wt%, especially inhibiting the hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalyst. In addition, HCl reacted with NH3 (byproduct of nitride hydrogenation) to generate NH4Cl. The high concentration of HCl in the reaction system increased the crystallization temperature of NH4Cl from 210 °C to 294 °C, which led to the crystallization of ammonium salts in the catalyst bed. NH4Cl crystals adsorbed on the catalyst surface, resulting in a decrease in specific surface area and pore volume, and an increase in the average pore diameter of the catalyst, which was the main reason for the rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Furthermore, based on the deactivation mechanism, several appropriate solutions were proposed.
