Simplified approach of modeling air gasification of biomass in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier using Aspen Plus as a simulation tool The consumption of fossil fuels over past decades not only raised concerns about the unavailability of fossil fuels for energy production in upcoming decades but also increased the emission of greenhouse gases which is the chief precursor of global warming. Thus, the present situation calls for the demand for carbon-neutral energy resources and sustainable carbon carrier resources like biomass. Thermochemical conversion processes like gasification generate valuable products like syngas from biomass which is further processed for the production of power, heat, and second-generation biofuels. One of the efficient techniques adopted in biomass gasification is Bubbling fluidized bed Gasification (BFBG). In the present study, ASPEN V12.1 is used to simulate the ‘BFBG of Groundnut shell powder (GNSP) with bubbling air as a gasifying medium’ to develop an efficient model for the process with unquantified char and tar in a by-product stream. The developed model is in very much agreement in terms of composition, yield, higher heating value of the syngas generated, and the carbon conversion efficiency and cold gas efficiency of the Bubbling fluidized bed reactor (BFBR). The highest gas yield (2.15 Nm3/kg in the experiment and 2.61 Nm3/kg in the simulation), as well as the highest H2 content (13.97 % in the experiment and 17.33 % in the simulation), are also close to each other. The relative error between the experimental and simulation values is determined to be less than 15 % in most of the cases. It is due to the operational conditions being different in simulation from that of the experiment.
