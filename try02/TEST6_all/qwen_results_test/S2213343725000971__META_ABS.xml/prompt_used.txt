You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simplified approach of modeling air gasification of biomass in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier using Aspen Plus as a simulation tool The consumption of fossil fuels over past decades not only raised concerns about the unavailability of fossil fuels for energy production in upcoming decades but also increased the emission of greenhouse gases which is the chief precursor of global warming. Thus, the present situation calls for the demand for carbon-neutral energy resources and sustainable carbon carrier resources like biomass. Thermochemical conversion processes like gasification generate valuable products like syngas from biomass which is further processed for the production of power, heat, and second-generation biofuels. One of the efficient techniques adopted in biomass gasification is Bubbling fluidized bed Gasification (BFBG). In the present study, ASPEN V12.1 is used to simulate the ‘BFBG of Groundnut shell powder (GNSP) with bubbling air as a gasifying medium’ to develop an efficient model for the process with unquantified char and tar in a by-product stream. The developed model is in very much agreement in terms of composition, yield, higher heating value of the syngas generated, and the carbon conversion efficiency and cold gas efficiency of the Bubbling fluidized bed reactor (BFBR). The highest gas yield (2.15 Nm3/kg in the experiment and 2.61 Nm3/kg in the simulation), as well as the highest H2 content (13.97 % in the experiment and 17.33 % in the simulation), are also close to each other. The relative error between the experimental and simulation values is determined to be less than 15 % in most of the cases. It is due to the operational conditions being different in simulation from that of the experiment.
