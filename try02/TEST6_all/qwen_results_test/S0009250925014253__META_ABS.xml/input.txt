Ionic liquid-mediated pore structure modulating in polyimide-derived carbon molecular sieve membranes for enhanced gas separation performance Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have attracted significant research attention owing to their exceptional gas transport properties, attributed to their tailorable pore structures that facilitate precise molecular discrimination based on subtle differences in molecular size and shape. Thereby, a novel hybrid CMS (HCMS) membrane was prepared via incorporating ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Bmim][OTF]) within a polyimide (PI) matrix, followed by low-temperature pyrolysis. The addition of ILs enabled precise modulation of the pore structures of CMS membrane, resulting in concurrent enhancement of both CO2 permeability and CO2/CH4 selectivity. Specifically, compared to the pristine PI-550 CMS membrane, the optimized PI-3%[Bmim][OTF]-550 HCMS membrane demonstrated a 2.8-fold improvement in CO2/CH4 selectivity (from 20.5 to 57.6) alongside a remarkable increase in CO2 permeability from 2871.9 to 4329.8 Barrer, surpassed the 2019 Robeson upper bound for gas separation membranes.
