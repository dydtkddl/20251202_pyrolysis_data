You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Boosting 2G bioethanol production by overexpressing dehydrogenase genes in Klebsiella sp. SWET4 adh1+adhE : ANN optimization, scale-up, and economic sustainability The most significant obstacle in the production of 2G bioethanol lies in transforming the complex carbohydrates found in plant biomass into simpler, fermentable sugars. However, this challenge can be effectively addressed by developing highly efficient lignocellulolytic ethanologenic strains. The current study intended to improve the ethanol productivity of efficient cellulose and hemicellulose metabolizing Klebsiella sp. SWET4 by overexpressing its native ethanologenic genes (adh1, adhE, and nifJ). Among the recombinants, SWET4 adh1+adhE exhibited the highest ethanol productivity from banana peel (BP) in facultative anaerobic conditions with a 7.76-fold increase compared to the native strain. Transcript level expression study using qPCR indicated 106.15- and 22.78-fold higher expression of adh1 and adhE gene, respectively at 56 h from BP, whereas, 4.80- and 2.08-fold higher concentrations of respective proteins were obtained after 24 h. ANN and GA-mediated optimization further enhanced biomass and ethanol production to 2.33 and 24.47 g/L, respectively. Hence the ethanol productivity by SWET4 adh1+adhE was enhanced by 19.89-fold. The bioreactor kinetic study exhibited diauxic growth of SWET4 adh1+adhE and achieved an impressive ethanol yield of 0.44 g/g of carbohydrates, surpassing many 2G bioethanol processes. Despite of single-product scheme, a minimum selling price of $2/kg of distillate was found to make the process economically feasible. The breakeven point of the process was found to be 30 % of its total capacity. Techno-economic analysis underscores the feasibility and economic advantages of the current study eliminating the pretreatment steps, and highlighting the process's innovation and viability in 2G bioethanol production. Elimination of the pretreatment process not only achieved economic sustainability but also significantly enhanced the renewability of bioethanol production endorsing direct biomass conversion to bioethanol.
