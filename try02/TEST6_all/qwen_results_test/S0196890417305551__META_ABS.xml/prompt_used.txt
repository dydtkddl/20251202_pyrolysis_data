You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics on Ni-Fe bimetallic catalyst To explore the mechanism of the influence of Ni-Fe bimetallic catalyst for the producing high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with clean hydrogen from waste plastic pyrolysis, the pyrolysis-catalysis of plastics were performed using a two stage fixed bed reaction system with Ni and Fe loading at variant molar ratios. The catalysts and produced carbon were analysed with various characterization method, including temperature-programed reduction/oxidation, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy or/and Raman spectroscopy. Both the H2 concentration and H2 yield reached maximum values of 73.93vol.% and 84.72mgg−1 plastic, respectively, as the ratio of Ni:Fe at 1:3. The amount and quality of CNTs were greatly influenced by the catalyst composition, and Ni and Fe display different roles to the overall reactivity of Ni-Fe catalyst for the pyrolysis-catalysis of waste plastics. Catalyst with more Fe loading produced more hydrogen and deposited carbon, due to higher cracking ability and the relatively lower interaction between active sites and support. The presence of Ni in Ni-Fe bimetallic catalyst enhanced the thermal stability and graphitization degree of produced carbons. The thermal quality of filamentous carbons might be associated with carbon defects.
