You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal liquefaction processes for plastics recycling: A review If our expectations are to have a future with the resources provided by the earth, the recycling of plastics has become one of the most important topics that, as humans, we must deal with. Among the technologies developed for treating this issue is the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) method. In this review, subcritical and supercritical hydrothermal processes are presented. Experimental methods and product yields are disclosed and discussed. Subcritical conditions have previously been used to depolymerize synthetic polymers containing heteroatoms, such as bisphenol-A-based epoxy resin (Epoxy), polyamide 6 (PA6), polyamide 6/6 (PA66), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyurethane (PU). This type of polymer can be broken down using this low-temperature, low-pressure method because it has heteroatoms that are easy to break down. To depolymerize polyolefins like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), derivatives and mixtures, formed by long hydrocarbon chains, supercritical water conditions (> 374 °C; > 23 MPa) seem to be required. These requirements make the procedure quite expensive. The review showed that a new method that uses pressures between 2.5 and 30 MPa, temperatures above 400 °C, and residence times of 20 to 60 min, named low-pressure hydrothermal liquefaction (LP-HTL), can be used to handle this type of polyolefin hydrocarbon. This review describes the conditions needed to handle this problematic type of feedstock and, in a certain way, the possible utilization of such technology for treating more complex waste mixtures.
