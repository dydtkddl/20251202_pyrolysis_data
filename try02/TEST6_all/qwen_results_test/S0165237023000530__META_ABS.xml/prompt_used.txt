You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Aromatics production from segmented co-pyrolysis of poplar sawdust and high-density polyethylene: Enhancing the synergistic effects Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste is a promising approach for producing renewable biofuels and value-added chemicals. However, because of their different pyrolysis behaviors, the synergy between biomass and plastic is limited, and low-yield aromatics are produced. Herein, a modified segmented catalytic co-pyrolysis technology was proposed, and the effects of pyrolysis parameters were studied in detail to enhance the synergistic effect between feedstocks. For the biomass section (segment 1), catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of poplar sawdust was conducted, and results showed that employing 15 wt% MgCl2 at 500 °C facilitated the production of furans. For the plastic section (segment 2), CFP of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were performed. It was showed that instead of Y and beta zeolites, the utilization of ZSM-5 as a pyrolysis catalyst with a loading of ZSM-5/HDPE = 1.0, and a temperature of 600 °C was beneficial for the production of short-chain olefins. For the segmented co-pyrolysis of poplar sawdust and HDPE (segment 1 + segment 2), the biomass-to-plastic ratio was crucial in aromatics production. A ratio of 1:1 was found to be most effective in producing MAHs (54.8 area%), which was ∼3.9 or 1.6 times that for the separate CFP of biomass or HDPE. This was also consistent with its higher enhancement factor, confirming that the synergy between poplar sawdust and HDPE was dramatically enhanced. Finally, a segmented catalytic co-pyrolysis reaction pathway was proposed.
