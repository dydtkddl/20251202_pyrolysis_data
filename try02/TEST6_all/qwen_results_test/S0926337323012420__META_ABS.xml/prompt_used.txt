You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective C–C and C–O bond cleavage strategies for the thermochemical upgrading of (hemi)cellulosic biomass Utilizing lignocellulose as an alternative green carbon resource is recognized as a vital approach to drive the ongoing transition towards a sustainable manufacture of chemicals, fuels, and materials with a low-carbon footprint. Unlike fossil resources, lignocellulose and its derivatives are featured by ubiquitous C–C and C–O bonds constituting carbon skeletons and various oxygenated moieties, respectively. Breaking these C–C/C–O bonds, in particular, the selective cleavage of specific C–C/C–O bonds present in biomass is of pivotal importance for the selective valorization of lignocellulose into targeted products. Hence, considerable attention has paid to searching for selective bond-breaking methods/strategies capable of tailoring different C–C/C–O bonds. Numerous conversion pathways based on selective C–C/C–O bond cleavage reactions have been developed to upgrade biomass into a broad spectrum of valuable products. In this review, we attempt to present a summary of existing selective C–C/C–O bond cleavage strategies frequently used for the upgrading of (hemi)cellulose, the dominant components of lignocellulose and also the major source of non-food carbohydrates. Each strategy is illustrated in terms of bond cleavage mechanism, utility in synthesizing various chemicals, representative catalyst systems, and coupling with other reactions to form cascade upgrading processes. Finally, pending challenges and potential opportunities related to selective bond cleavage strategies are discussed to propose future research directions. We hope that this review will help inspire further progress in designing new selective approaches for (hemi)cellulose valorization.
