You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast and isothermal acetolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate): Reaction pathways and kinetic modeling Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) acetolysis enables depolymerization into the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol diacetate (EGDA). Acetic acid serves as both reaction medium and reactant. This work explores isothermal and fast (rapid heating, short time) acetolysis across a range of heat source set point temperatures (200–570 °C) and PET/acetic acid mass ratios and batch reactor holding times from 15 s to 120 min. TPA yields up to 80 % were achieved in under 3 min via rapid heating from room temperature toward 400–420 °C set points, but the yields are significantly lower at higher final set point temperatures due to decomposition of both solvent and product. A kinetics model based on a reaction network with three irreversible pathways successfully correlated both literature data and the present experimental product yields. The kinetics model, which includes the temperature-dependent density of acetic acid, correlates the TPA yields with a root-mean-square error of 16 %. The activation energy for PET acetolysis was found to be 109.5 ± 0.4 kJ/mol. Acetolysis is advantaged over hydrolysis for chemical recycling of PET by achieving higher TPA yields at comparable conditions and with reduced solvent demand relative to the PET loading. Disadvantages would include solvent decomposition and greater solvent cost.
