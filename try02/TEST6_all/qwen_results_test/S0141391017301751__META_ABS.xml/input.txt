Molecular weight dependence and stereoselective chain cleavage during the early stages of the isotactic polypropylene pyrolysis The comparative study on the pyrolysis of two Polypropylene samples, with a similar high isotactic character but quite distinct molecular weights, reveals a significant difference in their thermal performances. The detailed qualitative analysis of the parameters, which are expected to govern the thermal degradation, leads to reasonably assume a main role of the molecular weight in their relative early stabilities. Furthermore, the correlation found between the sharp initial build-up of the Eact and the selective cleavage of isotactic stereosequences in both samples, suggests the relevance of the stereoregular length into the energy required for chain scission.
