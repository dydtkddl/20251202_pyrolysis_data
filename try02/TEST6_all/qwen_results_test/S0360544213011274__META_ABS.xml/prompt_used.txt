You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of biomass fast pyrolysis part II: The effects that bio-pyrolysis oil has on the performance of diesel engines This study used the fast pyrolysis method to produce bio-oil from coffee bean residue. The oil was mixed with diesel fuel through emulsification to produce emulsified fuel with varying proportions. A single-cylinder diesel engine connected to a 12-kW power generation system was used as the test system to examine the performance indices of a diesel engine under various loads and rotational speeds when using three fuel mixtures with varying proportions of bio-oil (i.e., CPO (coffee bean residue pyrolysis oil) 0 (100% diesel), CPO 5 (5 vol.% bio-oil/95 vol.% diesel), and CPO 10 (10 vol.% bio-oil/90 vol.% diesel)). According to the results, compared to CPO 0, the addition of CPO 5 and CPO 10 increased the fuel consumed for the same power output. Although CPO 5 and CPO 10 had lower heating values that reduced combustion efficiency, the water content and emulsification properties of these fuels enhanced certain aspects of combustion. Increasing the proportion of bio-oil effectively reduced NO x emissions, but in certain situations, denser smoke was produced. The smoke resulted from the added bio-oil, which reduced heating values and combustion efficiency. The emulsification properties of the oil contributed to microexplosion of oil droplets, which enhanced combustion characteristics.
