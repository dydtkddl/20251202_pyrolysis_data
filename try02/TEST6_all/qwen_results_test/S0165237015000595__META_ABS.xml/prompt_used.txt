You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic from electrical and electronic equipment Plastic waste collected from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was pyrolysed in the presence of zeolite catalysts to produce a gasoline range aromatic oil. The plastic was from equipment containing cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and also plastic waste from refrigeration equipment. In addition, for comparison the main plastics contained in the WEEE, in the form of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) were also pyrolysed in the presence of the zeolite catalysts. Two zeolite catalysts; Y zeolite and ZSM-5 were used. Catalytic pyrolysis took place in a two stage fixed bed, batch reactor with the plastic pyrolysed in the first stage and the evolved pyrolysis gases catalysed in the second stage reactor. The quantity of oil produced from uncatalysed pyrolysis of plastics from CRTs and refrigerators was more than 80wt%. The gases consisted of hydrogen, methane and C2–C4 hydrocarbons. When the zeolite catalysts were introduced there was a decrease of between 5 and 10wt% in oil yield and a corresponding increase in gas yield. The composition of the oils derived from the uncatalysed pyrolysis of WEEE plastics were mainly aromatic with high concentrations of styrene, derived from the HIPS and ABS present in the plastic waste. Addition of the zeolite ZSM-5 and Y zeolite to the pyrolysis process resulted in significant concentrations of benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene in the product oil but reduced concentrations of styrene. The oils from both thermal and catalysed pyrolysis also contained significant concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for example, naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene.
