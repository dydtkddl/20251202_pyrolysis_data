Characterization and pyrolysis kinetic modelling of lignocellulosic waste from rambutan seeds: A machine learning approach This study evaluated the thermal kinetic behaviour of lignocellulosic waste from rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum), a seasonal tropical fruit commercially available in Southeast Asia. A series of preparation steps was conducted to produce ultrafine rambutan seed (RS) powder prior to functional group analysis, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, morphology microscopy, and elemental analysis. To assess their kinetic behaviour, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed at varying heating rates to determine the thermal degradation behaviour of the RS powder configuration during lignocellulosic characterization. The kinetic parameters were determined using model-free (Friedman and modified Vyazovkin) and model-fitting approaches, revealing a complex multistep reaction mechanism. The activation energies across the conversion range (α = 0.2–0.7) averaged 283.05 kJ/mol (Friedman) and 281.79 kJ/mol (VZ). In addition, machine learning models, including MLP, BRT, CRT, and MARS, were applied to predict activation energy values. The MARS model attained the maximum accuracy, evidenced by a R2 of 0.9974 and the lowest RMSE, closely correlating with the reference data. This study demonstrated that machine learning is a powerful and reliable tool for modelling biomass pyrolysis kinetics. This study fills a notable gap in the literature on rambutan biomass and establishes a framework for integrating kinetic modelling with machine learning to support the development of bioenergy from agricultural residues.
