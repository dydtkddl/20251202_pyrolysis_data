You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green approach for fabrication of graphene from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle waste as reactive material for dyes removal from aqueous solution: Batch and continuous study This study is concerned with the synthesis of graphene from PET waste bottles as raw material and investigates the possibility of using it as an inexpensive and active material for the removal of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) from aqueous solution. The synthesis process was achieved in a green way through the manufacture of a stainless steel autoclave that reduces the emission of toxic gases and accelerates the pyrolysis process. The synthesized graphene is characterized by FTIR, SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, and surface area. Many factors that affect dyes removal percent were studied such as contact time, initial pH of the solution, agitation speed, initial concentration, and sorbent dosage. The sorption isotherm and kinetics study were described using two isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich) and two kinetic models (pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order), while the column experimental data were fitted with four breakthrough curve models (Thomas-BDST, Bohart–Adams, Yan, and Clark). The experimental results proved that the prepared graphene can be a promising reactive material for the removal of dyes (MB and MO) from aqueous solutions.
