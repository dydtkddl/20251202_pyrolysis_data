You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Programmable heating and quenching for enhancing coal pyrolysis tar yield: A ReaxFF molecular dynamics study In this paper, the impact of the programmable heating and quenching (PHQ) method on coal pyrolysis tar yield was investigated via ReaxFF molecular dynamics method. Firstly, thermostatic pyrolysis simulations of coal were performed to determine the range of maximum (T max) and minimum (T min) temperatures for the PHQ method. Then, the effects of the ratio of heating time (t h ) and cooling time (t c ), T max, and T min on pyrolysis tar yield were investigated. The results showed that reducing t h /t c , T max, and T min helped to improve tar yield. Finally, the effects upon pyrolysis products were compared between the conventional continuous heating (CCH) method and the PHQ method. It was revealed that 37.67 % increase in tar yield was achieved with the PHQ method compared to the CCH method. The main basic reactions during coal pyrolysis were analyzed to reveal the mechanism of the PHQ method on tar yield. There were three ways to increase tar yield with the PHQ method: (1) the elevated production of OH radicals during each heating stage facilitated the decomposition of char into tar; (2) the reduction of temperature during each quenching stage hindered the condensation reactions among tar molecules; (3) the reactivity of the tar was also diminished.
