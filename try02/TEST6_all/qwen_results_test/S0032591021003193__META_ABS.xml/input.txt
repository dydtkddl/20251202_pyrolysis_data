Pneumatic feeding characteristics into dense-phase region of a fluidized bed for biomass pyrolysis That biomass particles are pneumatically fed into the dense-phase region of a fluidized bed is of great significance for the design and operation of pyrolysis equipment. Single factor experiments are adopted in the linkage apparatus to study the effects of the material properties and operating conditions on the pneumatic feeding characteristics of the bed. The results show the feeding rate decreases with the particle size, decreases with the gas velocity, and presents a parabolic and a “M” shape variation with the static bed height and volume flow ratio, respectively. The pneumatic feeding mechanism of the injection gas and the fluidizing gas is different, while the effect of the two gases is complementary in the pneumatic feed. And their reasonable volume flow ratio improves the feeding rate and stability. A regression model is finally developed with R 2 = 0.928, which can well predict and guide the pneumatic feed of the bed.
