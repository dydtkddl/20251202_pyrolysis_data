You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastics with iron-based catalysts for hydrogen and carbon nanotubes production This study presents a microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) for plastics using iron-based catalysts with the aim to convert high-density polyethylene into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). A multistep mechanism was proposed based on the microwave-induced ‘micro-hot spots’ theory, indicating that the yield and composition of pyrolytic products are mainly determined by the microwave absorbing property and the activity of the catalysts. To validate the mechanism, iron-based catalysts with different microwave-absorbing properties were prepared using different catalyst supports including activated carbon, silicon carbide, and silicon dioxide. The experimental results showed that the catalysts with high dielectric loss promoted the gas yield and the growth of CNTs. This was due to the local high-temperature domains generated over the catalyst surface under microwave irradiation. In addition, the role of catalytic activity was explored by designing FeAlOx catalysts with different iron loadings. An increase in iron content from 7% to 22% improved the gas yield from 86.3% to 93.7% but has insignificant effect on the morphology of CNTs. Conclusions drawn from this study can guide the future design and development of microwave-responsive catalysts for the microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic wastes towards circular economy.
