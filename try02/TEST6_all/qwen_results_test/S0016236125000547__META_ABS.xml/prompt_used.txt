You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the possibility of using waste plastic fuel and gasoline fuel mixture in gasoline direct injection engine through experimental studies and the Taguchi method This study explores the use of waste plastic oil (WPO) as a potential substitute for gasoline in gasoline direct injection (GDi) spark-ignition (SI) engines. WPO was blended with gasoline in various ratios to assess its feasibility for reducing crude oil dependency and addressing global plastic waste management challenges. The WPO was extracted using a thermal-catalytic pyrolysis process in a batch reactor, utilizing a novel catalyst and discarded plastic chairs (comprising polycarbonate and high/low-density polyethylene) sourced from the university. The chemical and physical properties of the WPO were analyzed and compared with gasoline to evaluate its compatibility as a blend component, supported by GC–MS and FTIR analyses. Experimental tests were conducted on a GDi-based SI engine with WPO/gasoline blends at different engine speeds (2000, 2500, and 3000 rpm) and load conditions (low, partial, and high). Key parameters such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), and Cylinder Pressure (CP) were measured, with fixed spark timing at 18° bTDC and injection pressure at 180 bars. The experimental design employed the Taguchi method (L18 orthogonal array) with input variables including WPO/gasoline blend ratio, engine load, and engine speed, aiming to optimize output responses such as BTE, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke, and carbon monoxide (CO). Results showed that the B05 blend (5% WPO) achieved approximately 3–5 % higher BTE than gasoline under all load conditions. Slight increases in EGT were observed for all blends, and delayed cylinder peak pressure trends were noted compared to gasoline at part load conditions. Optimization analysis identified the B05 blend, a load of 7 Nm, and an engine speed of 2000 rpm as the optimal conditions. A significant performance improvement was also observed for the B20 blend. Individual response optimizations using contour and surface plots revealed the critical influence of load and blend ratio on engine performance and emissions.
