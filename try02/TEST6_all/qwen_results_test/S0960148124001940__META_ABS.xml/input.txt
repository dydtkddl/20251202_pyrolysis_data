Characterization and treatments in soybean hull for 2,3-Butanediol production using Klebsiella pneumoniae BLh-1 and Pantoea agglomerans BL1 Today, renewable sources like lignocellulosic materials are a potential source of substrates for the production of a variety of valuable bioproducts. Among these products, 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) can be found. This study focuses on characterization of soybean hull and application of different treatments for fermentative production of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD). The samples, before and after treatments, were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, crystallinity, morphology and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. To assess inhibitor concentrations in the hydrolysate, three detoxification methods were employed on acid hydrolysate: calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and activated charcoal. The production of 2,3-BD was assessed through fermentations involving two previously isolated enterobacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae BLh-1, and Pantoea agglomerans BL1, cultivated at 37 °C and 120 rpm for 28 h. P. agglomerans BL1 exhibited complete sugar consumption within 24 h of cultivation. However, the highest concentration of 2,3-BD was achieved in the treatment utilizing sodium hydroxide with K. pneumoniae BLh-1, boasting a productivity of 0.51 g −1 h−1.
