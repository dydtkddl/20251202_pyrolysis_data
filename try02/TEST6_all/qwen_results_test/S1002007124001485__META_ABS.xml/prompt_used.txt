You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solid-liquid phase change materials microcapsules: Synthesis strategies, thermal storage and beyond Thermal energy storage is crucial in the context of achieving carbon neutrality. Phase change latent heat stands out among various thermal storage methods due to the high energy density of phase change materials (PCMs). PCMs possess unique characteristics such as tunable thermal storage or/and release processes, constant phase-transition temperatures, and changes in physical state. However, solid-liquid PCMs cannot be directly utilized due to the liquid leakage in their melted state. The encapsulation of PCM microcapsules (PCMMs) is essential for overcoming limitations and optimizing functionalities of the PCMs. Encapsulation strategies play a key role in considering factors like morphology, structure, physicochemical properties, and specific applications. Furthermore, PCMMs can expand their potential applications by incorporating functional nano-materials within their shells or introducing specific components into their cores during the synthesis process. This review examines various encapsulation strategies for PCMMs, including physical, physicochemical, and chemical methods. Various applications of PCMMs are summarized and analyzed with regards to the characteristics of PCMs in thermal storage, temperature control, and state transformation. Furthermore, the reinforcement strategies or/and design considerations of PCMMs are crucial for meeting specific requirements, such as conventional latent heat storage, thermal protection, and thermal-triggered intelligent materials. Finally, it discusses current challenges, proposed solutions, and future research directions in the field of PCMMs, particularly Janus particle modified PCMMs.
