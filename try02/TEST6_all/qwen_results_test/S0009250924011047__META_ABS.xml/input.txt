Economic feasibility of the biorefinery processing bamboo residues with biphasic phenoxyethanol-acid pretreatment technology: Techno-economic analysis This study conducted a techno-economic analysis to assess the economic feasibility of a biorefinery converting bamboo residues to bioproducts via phenoxyethanol-acid pretreatment. The analysis is integrated with a rigorous process simulation model with the support of experiment data. The bioproducts include ethanol or polylactic acid (PLA), with lignin-based wood adhesive as the byproduct. The minimum selling price (MSP) is $515-$819 per t ethanol and $1,512-$1,842 per t PLA when biphasic treatment is deployed, compared to the MSP of $2,318-$2,721 per t ethanol and $2,859-$3,211 per t PLA for no biphasic pretreatment. Adopting a ratio of 1:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution (1%) in pretreatment decreases the final product yield but leads to lower MSP than 4:1 phenoxyethanol: acid solution (1%) due to lower phenoxyethanol consumption. A sensitivity analysis identifies the key drivers of reducing MSP, including increasing economic gain from the lignin-based wood adhesive, lowering the phenoxyethanol cost, and expanding plant capacity.
