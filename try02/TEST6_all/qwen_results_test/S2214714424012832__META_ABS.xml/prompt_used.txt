You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Innovative iron‑manganese modified microalgae biochar for efficient phosphate iron removal from water: Preparation and adsorption mechanisms This study developed a novel FeMn composite biochar (FMBC) with the pyrolysis raw resource of Chlorella, applying for phosphates removal from the aqueous. Under optimal conditions, the FMBC prepared from microalgae achieved a phosphate removal rate of approximately 91.6 % (adsorption capacity: 23.23 mg/g) within 120 min, demonstrating superior adsorption performance compared to the pristine biochar. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied for FMBC preparation optimization. To improve the metal loading capacity of biochar, Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) was used as a chelating agent during the preparation process. The optimum preparation conditions for FMBC were Fe/biomass(w/w) ratio of 1.25, Mn/biomass(w/w) ratio of 1.10, pyrolysis time of 120 min, and pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C, which presented a large specific surface area (14.681 m2/g), pore volume (0.036 cm3/g) with the rich oxygen-containing functional groups. Phosphorus removal kinetic and isotherm process were better described by pseudo-second-order model and the Dubinin-Radushkevinch (D-R) isotherm. In addition, the optimal adsorption conditions for FMBC were as follows: biochar dosage of 0.1 g, initial pH of 7.0, adsorption temperature of 25 °C, and initial phosphate concentration of 50 mg/L. Physical adsorption, surface complexation, precipitation, electrostatic attractions, and ion exchange were responsible for phosphate adsorption process by FMBC. The main innovation of this study is the use of explosive growth algae to prepare metal-modified biochar for phosphorus removal from water bodies, to realize the goals of resource utilization of waste biomass and eutrophication control in water, which are significant for sustainable development.
