Pyrolysis and combustion studies of fossil fuels by thermal analysis methods Instances where differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis have been applied to study the pyrolysis and combustion behaviour of fossil fuels (peat, lignite, bituminous coals, anthracite, oil shales, crude oils, lignite-oil mixtures, etc.) are reviewed. The literature survey showed that thermal methods were important not only theoretically but also from a practical point of view.
