Polysaccharide-derived carbon quantum dots: advances in preclinical studies, theranostic applications, and future clinical trials Polysaccharide-derived carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as promising nanomaterials, valued for their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and outstanding fluorescence characteristics, which make them ideal for diverse biomedical applications, particularly in theranostics. These carbon-based nanoparticles uniquely merge diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, holding significant potential for both detecting and treating various diseases. Renewable and abundant polysaccharides—such as chitosan, starch, cellulose, pectin, alginate, dextran, and heparin—are excellent carbon precursors for CQD synthesis. Their inherent functional groups, like hydroxyl and carboxyl, enhance the stability, solubility, and adaptability of the resulting CQDs, broadening their application in imaging, drug delivery, and cancer treatment. Additionally, these CQDs have demonstrated potential in targeted drug delivery, controlled release systems, and tissue regeneration, solidifying their role in both diagnostic and therapeutic realms. This review examines recent progress in the synthesis of polysaccharide-derived CQDs, emphasizing preclinical studies that showcase their use in imaging, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. It further explores their prospective role in theranostic applications and outlines the challenges that must be overcome to transition these nanomaterials into clinical trials. With continued research and innovation, polysaccharide-derived CQDs are poised to contribute significantly to future clinical applications, facilitating more effective and personalized treatment strategies across a spectrum of diseases.
