You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polysaccharide-derived carbon quantum dots: advances in preclinical studies, theranostic applications, and future clinical trials Polysaccharide-derived carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as promising nanomaterials, valued for their biocompatibility, low toxicity, and outstanding fluorescence characteristics, which make them ideal for diverse biomedical applications, particularly in theranostics. These carbon-based nanoparticles uniquely merge diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, holding significant potential for both detecting and treating various diseases. Renewable and abundant polysaccharides—such as chitosan, starch, cellulose, pectin, alginate, dextran, and heparin—are excellent carbon precursors for CQD synthesis. Their inherent functional groups, like hydroxyl and carboxyl, enhance the stability, solubility, and adaptability of the resulting CQDs, broadening their application in imaging, drug delivery, and cancer treatment. Additionally, these CQDs have demonstrated potential in targeted drug delivery, controlled release systems, and tissue regeneration, solidifying their role in both diagnostic and therapeutic realms. This review examines recent progress in the synthesis of polysaccharide-derived CQDs, emphasizing preclinical studies that showcase their use in imaging, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. It further explores their prospective role in theranostic applications and outlines the challenges that must be overcome to transition these nanomaterials into clinical trials. With continued research and innovation, polysaccharide-derived CQDs are poised to contribute significantly to future clinical applications, facilitating more effective and personalized treatment strategies across a spectrum of diseases.
