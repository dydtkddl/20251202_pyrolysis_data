You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Desulfurization of pyrolytic oils from waste tire pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor with boron nitride adsorbents The study focused on producing hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as an adsorbent which provides high efficiency in desulfurization processes. The synthesized hBN is used for sulfur removal from liquid fuel derived from end-of-life tires (ELTs). Characterization of hBN was performed using FTIR, XRD, TGA, and SEM-EDS analyses. Liquid fuel was produced in a fluidized bed reactor at 550 °C under a nitrogen gas flow. Post-desulfurization, the fuel's density, water content, and calorific value increased, while sulfur content and flash point decreased, with sulfur content showing a significant reduction of 79.23 %. The desulfurized fuel (PS-A) exhibited better combustion characteristics and closely resembled diesel fuel performance, though it slightly reduced engine effective efficiency by 1.06 % compared to diesel. Both PS-A and pre-desulfurized fuel (PS-B) significantly reduced soot emissions by 23.28 % and 20.81 %, respectively, compared to diesel. Additionally, CO emissions were lower for PS-A and PS-B, with reductions of 4.35 % and 2.00 %, respectively. However, CO2 emissions increased by 1.60 % for PS-A and 0.86 % for PS-B, attributed to higher fuel consumption. Overall, hBN effectively reduced sulfur content and improved several fuel properties of pyrolytic liquids. The study highlights the environmental and economic benefits of enhancing ELT-derived liquid fuels and suggests potential applications in real systems, serving as a foundation for new technologies and projects.
