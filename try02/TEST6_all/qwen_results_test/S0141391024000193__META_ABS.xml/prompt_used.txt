You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flame retardancy in isotactic polypropylene modified with crystalline coordination polymers based on calcium, zinc or aluminum dimethyl phosphates A novel variety of metal organophosphates (MOPs) coordination polymers: calcium bis(dimethyl phosphate) (CaDMP), zinc bis(dimethyl phosphate) (ZnDMP) and aluminum tris(dimethyl phosphate) was examined for the first time to act as potential flame retardants in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) materials and their flame-retarding activity compared with widely used commercial flame retarder ammonium polyphosphate (APP). All iPP composites containing 20 wt. % of MOPs as with APP achieve V-2 in the UL-94 test and LOI values even higher (25.5 vol. % for iPP/20 %CaDMP) than determined for APP-containing material accompanied by maintaining or slightly degrading mechanical properties. Also in mass loss calorimeter test (MLC) the MOPs demonstrated a positive effect on the fire response of the obtained composites leading to a reduced, in the case of ZnDMP, the peak of heat release rate (pHRR), total heat evolved (THE), average effective heat of combustion (avEHC), fire growth rate (FIGRA) by 57 %, 35 %, 29 %, 63 % respectively when compared with pure iPP. Moreover the detailed analysis of the solid and liquid pyrolysis products of MOPs was done via FTIR. The FTIR spectra and PRXD studies of the char residues after combustion indicated the formation of a solid, inorganic condensed phosphates and release of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into the gas phase. Finally, the flame retardancy mechanism of MOPs was proposed based on results of MLC test and of the pyrolysis experiment. The gas phase activity of all three MOPs was confirmed by the decrease of avEHC most probably due to release of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into flame, whereas, in particular ZnDMP acted strongly in the condensed phase by forming a intumescent, protective layer.
