Low temperature pyrolysis of simulated spent anion exchange resins Studies of the low temperature pyrolysis of simulated spent cation exchange resins have indicated that this process offers several advantages relative to more traditional approaches involving direct immobilization. However, little is known concerning the fate of long-lived radioisotopes that are typically concentrated in anion exchange resins. In this work anion exchange resins have been loaded with macroscopic quantities of I−, Cl− and CO3 2− spiked with 14CO3 2− with the aim of simulating the spent radioactive anion exchange resins. The anion-loaded resins were pyrolyzed at increasing temperatures up to 500°C and the volatilization of 14CO3 2− , I − and Cl− was monitored and quantified using radiotracer and mass spectrometric methods A significant fraction of the initial 14C and Cl− inventories were volatilized at temperatures in the range 200–300°C. However, mass spectrometry of the gaseous releases indicated that at 300°C most of the iodine remained within the pyropolymer product. This was confirmed through SEM-based energy dispersive X-ray analysis of the solid products. In the same temperature range, experiments indicated that water was expelled non-reversibly. Leaching experiments were conducted on the anion-loaded pyropolymer products generated at different temperatures in order to determine the quantity of iodide released to solution. For resin pyrolyzed below 400°C the fractional iodine release to solution did not exceed 0.10 indicating that the major part of the iodine inventory in the pyropolymers was not leachable. The results indicate that low temperature pyrolysis could be used to convert spent anionic and cationic resins to stable pyropolymer products in which a large proportion of the initial radioisotope inventory could be rendered stable.
