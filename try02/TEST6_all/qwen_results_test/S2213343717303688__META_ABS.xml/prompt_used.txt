You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low temperature pyrolysis of simulated spent anion exchange resins Studies of the low temperature pyrolysis of simulated spent cation exchange resins have indicated that this process offers several advantages relative to more traditional approaches involving direct immobilization. However, little is known concerning the fate of long-lived radioisotopes that are typically concentrated in anion exchange resins. In this work anion exchange resins have been loaded with macroscopic quantities of I−, Cl− and CO3 2− spiked with 14CO3 2− with the aim of simulating the spent radioactive anion exchange resins. The anion-loaded resins were pyrolyzed at increasing temperatures up to 500°C and the volatilization of 14CO3 2− , I − and Cl− was monitored and quantified using radiotracer and mass spectrometric methods A significant fraction of the initial 14C and Cl− inventories were volatilized at temperatures in the range 200–300°C. However, mass spectrometry of the gaseous releases indicated that at 300°C most of the iodine remained within the pyropolymer product. This was confirmed through SEM-based energy dispersive X-ray analysis of the solid products. In the same temperature range, experiments indicated that water was expelled non-reversibly. Leaching experiments were conducted on the anion-loaded pyropolymer products generated at different temperatures in order to determine the quantity of iodide released to solution. For resin pyrolyzed below 400°C the fractional iodine release to solution did not exceed 0.10 indicating that the major part of the iodine inventory in the pyropolymers was not leachable. The results indicate that low temperature pyrolysis could be used to convert spent anionic and cationic resins to stable pyropolymer products in which a large proportion of the initial radioisotope inventory could be rendered stable.
