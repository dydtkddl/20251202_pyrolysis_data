You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of the environmental parameters on single cell protein production and composition by Cupriavidus necator Due to the rapid increase in the world's population, many developing countries are facing malnutrition problems, including famine and food insecurity. Particularly, the deficiency of protein sources becomes a serious problem for human and animal nutrition. In this context, Single Cell Proteins, could be exploited as an alternative source of unconventional proteins. The aim of the study was to investigate SCP production and composition by Cupriavidus necator under various environmental conditions, temperature and pH values. A mono-factorial approach was implemented using batch bioreactor cultures under well-controlled conditions. Results were compared in terms of bacterial growth and SCP composition (proteins, nucleic acids, amino acids and elemental formula). Complementary analyses were performed by flow cytometry to study cell morphology, membrane permeability and the presence of Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) production. Our data confirmed the ability of C. necator to produce high amount of proteins (69 %DW at 30 °C and pH7). The results showed that temperature and pH independently impact SCP production and composition. This impact was particularly observed at the highest temperature (40 °C) and also the lowest pH value (pH5) providing lower growth rates, cell elongation, changes in granularity and lower amounts of proteins (down to 44 %DW at pH5) and nucleic acids. These low percentages were related to the production of PHB production (up to 44 %DW at 40 °C) which is the first report of a PHB accumulation in C. necator under nutrient unlimited conditions.
