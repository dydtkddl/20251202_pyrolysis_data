You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquid crystalline polyurethane/POSS hybrid nanocomposites pyrolysis studies by Py-GC/MS and TG/FTIR techniques The process of pyrolysis of liquid crystalline polyurethane (LCPU) composites with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) has been studied using pyrolysis - gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermogravimetry/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG/FTIR) coupled thermoanalytical techniques. LCPU elastomers modified with POSS molecules with different architectures, bearing aromatic, isobutyl and cycloaliphatic moieties, yield various volatile products of pyrolysis that were collected and characterized. The TG study showed significant differences in the thermal behavior of composites studied, evidencing the influence of the silsesquioxane type on the polyurethane pyrolysis paths. FTIR study of volatile products of thermal decomposition showed the presence of characteristic bands originated from carbonyl, amine, ether, methylene, and unsaturated hydrocarbon linkages. GC/MS investigation confirmed the existence of compounds identified by the IR method. The application of both thermoanalytical methods made it possible to postulate the thermal decomposition routes of PU/POSS hybrids and to point out the main factors responsible for changes in the thermal stability.
