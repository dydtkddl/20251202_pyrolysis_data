You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

New instrumentation in mass spectrometry An overview will be given about the progress in mass spectrometer instrumentation throughout the last years using the five functional elements as a guideline: sample introduction, ion production, mass separation, ion current detection and instrument control/data handling. The relations between the functional elements will be discussed together with the physics behind these elements. Historical remarks and commentary related to instrumental development will also be presented. Introduction: Unique features of mass spectrometry. Reasons for their existence. Relation to optical spectrometry, Planck's and Einstein's laws. 1. 1. Sample Introduction: 1.1 Nonvolatiles: rapid heating/fast energy transfer, direct chemical ionization, particle bombardment (SIMS, FAB, laser, 252Cf), pyrolysis of biological samples. 1.2 On-Line: GC/MS- and LC/MS-interfacing, introduction and ionization of solids by inductively coupled plasma, on-line 13C/12C analyses of GC fractions. 1.3 Automation: automated direct probes, automated batch inlet systems. 1.4 Small samples: 13 C 12 C analyses, gas ion probe, automated introduction of thermionic samples. 2. 2. Ion Production: Why do mass spectrometers require ion sources? Gravity mass spectrometer. 3. 3. Mass Separation: 3.1 Transmission: basic ion optical laws, stigmatic and wide angle focusing, image error correction. 3.2 Speed: laminated magnets, fast and high resolution selected ion monitoring. 3.3 Specificity: various systems of MS/MS (sectors, quads), linked scan technique, multidimensional separation, selected ion flow tube, isotope separators, parabola spectrograph, secondary ion probe. 3.4 Mass range: high mass range sector instruments and quads, Wien-filter, time of flight instruments, Liouville's theorem. 3.5 Resolution: ion cyclotron/Fourier transform mass spectrometry, ultra-high resolution, ion trap, ultra-high precision mass determination. 4. 4. Ion Current Detection: Electro-optical ion detection, energetic ion mass spectrometer, multicollector systems, multichannel averaging, positive/negative ion detection, phase sensitive detection, coincidence photoion-photoelectron spectrometer. 5. 5. Instrument Control and Data Handling: Off-line processing/central computer, dedicated computer systems, fast data acquisition, instrument control through front end microprocessors, data-dependent experiments, lab data management, future aspects.
