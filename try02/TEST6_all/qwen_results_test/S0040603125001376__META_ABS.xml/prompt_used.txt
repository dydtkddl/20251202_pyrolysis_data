You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on tensile strength changes and the fingerprint products of crystalline and amorphous cellulose at their early pyrolysis stage to advance cellulosic wastes recycle Understanding the failure mechanics of cellulosic wastes during thermal treatment is crucial for advancing their recycle or recovery. This study employs Reactive force field Molecular Dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations to investigate the changes in tensile strength of both crystalline and amorphous celluloses during their early pyrolysis stages. It reveals that the ultimate tensile strength of crystalline cellulose decreases with increasing pyrolysis temperature, and a notable transition from brittle behavior to ductile behavior is observed when temperature is above 1200 K. The number of C2 molecules from pyrolysis reactions is inversely related to the ultimate tensile strength, identifying C2 as a fingerprint product for predicting the tensile strength of crystalline cellulose. Inversely, amorphous cellulose exhibits ductile stretching at all temperatures, with ultimate tensile strength at 1800 K being 0.296 GPa, much lower than 0.657 GPa for crystalline cellulose. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for advancing the process design or recovery of cellulosic wastes.
