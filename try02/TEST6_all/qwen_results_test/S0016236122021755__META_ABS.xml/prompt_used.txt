You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Active learning-based exploration of the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste Research in chemical engineering requires experiments, which are often expensive, time-consuming, and laborious. Design of experiments (DoE) aims to extract maximal information from a minimum number of experiments. The combination of DoE with machine learning leads to the field of active learning, which results in a more flexible, multi-dimensional selection of experiments. Active learning has not yet been applied in reaction modeling, as most active learning techniques still require an excessive amount of data. In this work, a novel active learning framework called GandALF that combines Gaussian processes and clustering is proposed and validated for yield prediction. The performance of GandALF is compared to other active learning strategies in a virtual case study for hydrocracking. Compared to these active learning methods, the novel framework outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a 33%-reduction in experiments. The proposed active learning approach is the first to also perform well for data-scarce applications, which is demonstrated by selecting experiments to investigate the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste. Both a common DoE-technique, and our methodology selected 18 experiments to study the effect of temperature, space time, and catalyst on the olefin yield for the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE. The experiments selected with active learning were significantly more informative than the regular DoE-technique, proving the applicability of GandALF for reaction modeling and experimental campaigns.
