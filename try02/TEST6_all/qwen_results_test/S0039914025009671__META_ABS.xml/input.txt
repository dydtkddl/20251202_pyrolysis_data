Challenges of Carbon Dots Immobilization – A review Given the potential of Carbon Dots and their wide applications, strategies for their immobilization are vital for the development of specific, stable and sensitive (bio)chemical analysis. In this review we start by demonstrating the most common and efficient immobilization procedures used in Cdots. Subsequently, we describe the Carbon dots-host nanocomposites synthesis, properties, and ultimately outline and revise the fields where they have been used by presenting applications in this field. The Carbon dots-host nanocomposites enhanced properties are also explored, namely: increase photoluminescence intensity and electron transfer rates, induce light absorption, bandgap tuning, abundant introduction of functional groups, lower toxicity and biocompatibility.
