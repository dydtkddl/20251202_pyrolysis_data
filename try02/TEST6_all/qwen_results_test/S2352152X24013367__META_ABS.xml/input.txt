MXene/carbon hybrid nanostructures and heteroatom-doped derivatives for enhanced electrochemical energy storage This review paper delves into the remarkable realm of MXene/carbon hybrid nanostructures within the context of electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices, exploring both the aspirations and realities of their application. The physicochemical attributes of MXenes are clarified, emphasizing the distinctive properties that render them promising candidates in energy storage systems. The synthesis methodologies of MXenes, including heteroatom-doped MXene-based materials and MXene-carbon composites, are expounded. This includes a comprehensive overview of the diverse strategies employed to engineer these hybrid structures. Focusing on energy storage applications, the intriguing domain of supercapacitors and batteries was explored. In the field of supercapacitors, the utilization of MXene-based materials including MXene/carbon hybrids and heteroatom-doped MXenes showcases enhanced performance and capacitance retention. In the case of batteries, the application of MXene-based materials in both lithium-ion batteries and beyond lithium-ion systems was explored. This review aims to comprehensively understand MXene/carbon hybrid nanostructures, including heteroatom-doped derivatives, their synthesis, and their potential to revolutionize the landscape of EES devices. By critically examining both the hopeful prospects and potential limitations, an effort is made to illuminate a balanced perspective on the current state of MXene/carbon-based energy storage research.
