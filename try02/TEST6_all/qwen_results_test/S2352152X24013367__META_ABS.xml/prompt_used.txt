You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MXene/carbon hybrid nanostructures and heteroatom-doped derivatives for enhanced electrochemical energy storage This review paper delves into the remarkable realm of MXene/carbon hybrid nanostructures within the context of electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices, exploring both the aspirations and realities of their application. The physicochemical attributes of MXenes are clarified, emphasizing the distinctive properties that render them promising candidates in energy storage systems. The synthesis methodologies of MXenes, including heteroatom-doped MXene-based materials and MXene-carbon composites, are expounded. This includes a comprehensive overview of the diverse strategies employed to engineer these hybrid structures. Focusing on energy storage applications, the intriguing domain of supercapacitors and batteries was explored. In the field of supercapacitors, the utilization of MXene-based materials including MXene/carbon hybrids and heteroatom-doped MXenes showcases enhanced performance and capacitance retention. In the case of batteries, the application of MXene-based materials in both lithium-ion batteries and beyond lithium-ion systems was explored. This review aims to comprehensively understand MXene/carbon hybrid nanostructures, including heteroatom-doped derivatives, their synthesis, and their potential to revolutionize the landscape of EES devices. By critically examining both the hopeful prospects and potential limitations, an effort is made to illuminate a balanced perspective on the current state of MXene/carbon-based energy storage research.
