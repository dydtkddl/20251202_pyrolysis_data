You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing biofuel production with Co-pyrolysis of distiller's grains and waste polypropylene: synergistic effects and activation energy optimization with hybrid FLO-ENN approach Biofuel production from renewable feedstocks is gaining significant attention due to the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions. This study proposes enhancing biofuel production through the co-pyrolysis of distiller's grains (DG) and waste polypropylene plastic (PP) using a hybrid FLO-ENN approach. The proposed approach is the joint execution of both the Frilled lizard Optimization (FLO) and Epistemic Neural Network (ENN). The main goal of this research is to improve the quality of biofuel production. The FLO algorithm is used to optimize the operational parameters to enhance the co-pyrolysis of DG and waste PP, while the ENN is employed to predict the quality of the biofuel. The proposed method is simulated using MATLAB to evaluate its performances and is compared with existing methods. The FLO-ENN approach achieves lower error as well as higher efficiency compared to existing techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Progressive Depth Swarm-Evolution (PDSE) and Artificial Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm (ANN-GA). Also, the co-pyrolisis of DG and PP yields low activation energy of 44.82 kJ mol-1. This improvement demonstrates that the proposed framework has significant potential to optimize the pyrolysis of polymeric wastes and biomass feedstocks more effectively, providing more accurate results than previous optimization techniques.
