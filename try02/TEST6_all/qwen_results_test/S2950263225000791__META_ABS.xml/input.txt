Advances in microplastic detection and interception: A state-of-the-art review Uncontrolled increase in the global plastics production has ushered in an environmental disaster that destroys human well-being and ecosystems. Most waste plastics are dumped in landfills or the environment, i.e., soil, waters, and air, where biodiversity loss, ecosystem service, and human well-being are jeopardized by air and ingestion exposure through microplastics (MPs). This review investigates current technologies for identifying and detecting MPs across a variety of environmental matrices, evaluates innovative interception strategies, and identifies research gaps to guide future mitigation efforts. It focuses on spectroscopic, microscopic, thermal, and AI-driven detection techniques, alongside innovative interception strategies encompassing physical, biological, and policy-based approaches, while identifying key research gaps to inform future mitigation. Addressing the complex challenge of MPs pollution demands integrated advancements in standardized detection protocols, cost-effective interception technologies, AI-driven automation, and interdisciplinary research, harmonized with robust global policies and increased investment to minimize the pervasive impacts of MPs across ecosystems.
