You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly active Ni–Mg–Al catalyst effect on carbon nanotube production from waste biodegradable plastic catalytic pyrolysis The catalyst composition effect on the biodegradable plastic (PolyLactic Acid, PLA) catalytic pyrolysis in generating hydrogen and high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was examined using Ni–Mg–Al oxygen carrier catalysts. Experiments were carried out in a two-stage fixed bed reactor, with the plastic pyrolyzed in the first stage and the resulting volatiles activated over the catalyst in the second stage. This research investigates the different catalytic pyrolysis temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) that could improve the hydrogen production and CNTs yield formed on the catalyst. The results reveal that the catalyst composition and pyrolytic temperature significantly affected the development of CNTs and hydrogen production. The Ni/MgAl2O4 produced the highest hydrogen (73 vol.%) and CNTs yield (374 mg g − 1 plastic) among the monometallic catalysts. Adding Ni to the Mg-based catalyst increased metal particle dispersion and metal-support interactions, resulting in better catalytic activity in proportion to filamentous carbon production. Increasing the Mg–Al concentration could promote CNTs graphitization. Therefore, the 1:2 ratio of Ni: Mg catalysts exhibited the most significant catalytic activity in the quantity and quality of generated CNTs. The formation mechanism of bamboo-like CNTs from pyrolysis and catalytic decomposition of PLA was also discussed.
