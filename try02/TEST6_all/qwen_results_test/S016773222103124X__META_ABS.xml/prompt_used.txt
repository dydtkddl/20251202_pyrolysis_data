You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of the synthesis methods, properties, and applications of layered double hydroxides/carbon nanocomposites The combination of carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, carbon dot, etc.) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) leads to the creation of efficient nanocomposites with excellent characteristics as many properties of these two substances can complement each other. On the other hand, these nanocomposites have received much attention owing to their multifunctional properties and a large number of composition/preparation variables attainable for fine-tuning. In this review paper, first, the properties of LDHs, carbon nanomaterials, and combined nanocomposite are described; then the current techniques used for the synthesis of these hierarchical nanocomposites are presented. Recent advancements illustrate that LDH/carbon material nanocomposites can be envisioned as promising adsorbents and photocatalysts, privileged catalysts, efficient energy storage systems, nanocomposites improving the properties of materials, and highly sensitive sensors. Moreover, the data related to the reported studies and the properties of these nanocomposites in each application are summarized. However, the communication between structure and applications, robust and accurate methods for the synthesis of LDH/carbon material nanocomposites with an excellent structure, more theoretical calculations via computer science, and application of this nanocomposite in other fields have not yet been sufficiently studied. These functional composites can be developed by applying different sciences. We hope that this review article would encourage researchers to develop the applications of LDH/carbon nanomaterial composites by environmentally friendly methods.
