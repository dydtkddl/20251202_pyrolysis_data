A review of the synthesis methods, properties, and applications of layered double hydroxides/carbon nanocomposites The combination of carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene, carbon dot, etc.) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) leads to the creation of efficient nanocomposites with excellent characteristics as many properties of these two substances can complement each other. On the other hand, these nanocomposites have received much attention owing to their multifunctional properties and a large number of composition/preparation variables attainable for fine-tuning. In this review paper, first, the properties of LDHs, carbon nanomaterials, and combined nanocomposite are described; then the current techniques used for the synthesis of these hierarchical nanocomposites are presented. Recent advancements illustrate that LDH/carbon material nanocomposites can be envisioned as promising adsorbents and photocatalysts, privileged catalysts, efficient energy storage systems, nanocomposites improving the properties of materials, and highly sensitive sensors. Moreover, the data related to the reported studies and the properties of these nanocomposites in each application are summarized. However, the communication between structure and applications, robust and accurate methods for the synthesis of LDH/carbon material nanocomposites with an excellent structure, more theoretical calculations via computer science, and application of this nanocomposite in other fields have not yet been sufficiently studied. These functional composites can be developed by applying different sciences. We hope that this review article would encourage researchers to develop the applications of LDH/carbon nanomaterial composites by environmentally friendly methods.
