You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Se/N Co-doped carbon for boosted organic oxidation via periodate activation: Impact of electronic structure reconstruction Herein, seleniSum and nitrogen (Se/N) co-doped carbon catalysts were prepared to improve the catalytic performance and degradation selectivity of periodate based advanced oxidation processes (PI-AOPs) for pollutant abatement. The additional Se/N doping in carbon resulted in a 183 % increase in the degradation efficiency of bisphenol A (BPA) compared to the exclusively N-doped carbon catalyst. The coupling effect of the dual dopants significantly enhanced the electron transfer process. DFT calculations revealed that the co-doping of Se and N induced electron rearrangement in the carbon lattice while simultaneously enhancing the adsorption energy for PI. Moreover, the dual-doping strategy narrowed the energy gap between the LUMO of the [SeNC-PI] complex and the HOMO of BPA, thereby offering an excellent electronic channel for facilitating the electron transfer process. Driven by the potential difference, selective degradation of different pollutants was dependent on the half-wave potential of organic compounds. Benefiting from the non-radical oxidation pathway, the SeNC800/PI system showed great resistance to interference from pH, coexisting ions and dissolved organic matter. This work provides a strategy for improving the oxidation performance and pathway selectivity of pollutants in PI-AOPs.
