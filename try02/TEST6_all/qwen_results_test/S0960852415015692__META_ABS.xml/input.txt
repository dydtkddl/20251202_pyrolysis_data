Catalytic supercritical water gasification of primary paper sludge using a homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst: Experimental vs thermodynamic equilibrium results H2, CH4, CO and CO2 yields were measured during supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of primary paper waste sludge (PWS) at 450°C. Comparing these yields with calculated thermodynamic equilibrium values offer an improved understanding of conditions required to produce near-equilibrium yields. Experiments were conducted at different catalyst loads (0–1g/gPWS) and different reaction times (15–120min) in a batch reactor, using either K2CO3 or Ni/Al2O3–SiO2 as catalyst. K2CO3 up to 1g/gPWS increased the H2 yield significantly to 7.5mol/kgPWS. However, these yields and composition were far from equilibrium values, with carbon efficiency (CE) and energy recovery (ER) of only 29% and 20%, respectively. Addition of 0.5–1g/gPWS Ni/Al2O3–SiO2 resulted in high H2 and CH4 yields (6.8 and 14.8mol/kgPWS), CE of 84–90%, ER of 83% and a gas composition relatively close to the equilibrium values (at hold times of 60–120min).
