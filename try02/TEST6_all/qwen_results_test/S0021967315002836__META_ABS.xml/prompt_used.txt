You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-gas chromatography–isotope ratio mass spectrometry of polyethylene Polyethylene is probably the most used plastic material in daily life and its accurate analysis is of importance. In this communication the chemical structure of polyethylenes is studied in detail using conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS), bulk stable isotopic analysis (IRMS) and pyrolysis compound specific stable isotopic analysis (Py-CSIA) to measure stable isotope proportions (δ13C, δ15N and δD) of polyethylene pyrolysis compounds. Polyethylene pyrolysis yields triplet peaks of n-alkanes, α-alkenes and α,ω-alkanedienes. No differences were found for bulk δ13C among different polyethylene types. However, conspicuous differences in δD were evident. It was possible to assign structure δ13C and δD values to specific polyethylene pyrolysis products in the range 12–18 carbon chain length. Conspicuous differences were found for the pyrolysis products with unsaturated moieties showing significant higher δD values than saturated chains (alkanes) that were deuterium depleted. In addition, a full isotopic fingerprinting (δ13C, δ15N and δD) for a dye (o-chloroaniline) contained in a polyethylene is reported. To the best of our knowledge this is the first application Py-CSIA to the study of a synthetic polymer. This hyphenated analytical technique is a promising tool to study synthetic materials, providing not only a fingerprinting, but also allowing the traceability of the polymerization process and the origin of the materials.
