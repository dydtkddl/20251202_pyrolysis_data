You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of microplastics under 20 μm in road dust using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS) Detecting microplastics (MPs) under 20 μm has been challenging, yet these tiny particles may pose significant threats to human health and the environment. They can be inhaled or ingested, potentially leading to respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal problems. This research proposed confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for identifying MPs smaller than 20 μm and to support its validity by comparing results to a typical gravimetric analysis for these small MPs in road dust samples using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS). A total of 30 road dust samples were collected from urban areas in Seoul and 15 samples from rural regions throughout South Korea. A strong agreement was observed between the results obtained from CLSM and Pyr-GC/MS, confirming the effectiveness of both methods in measuring MPs under 20 μm especially when polyolefins are dominating MPs. CLSM, coupled with BiofilmQ software, enabled precise volumetric analysis, while Pyr-GC/MS provided rapid identification of chemical compositions, suggesting that they are complementary. Mass concentrations of MPs in rural road dust (14.2 ± 6.4 μg g−1) were greater than those in urban road dust (7.8 ± 4.6 μg g−1), likely due to less stringent plastic waste management and increased agricultural plastic use in rural areas. This study builds upon prior volumetric imaging methods by enabling mass quantification of MPs under 20 μm using CLSM and validating the results against Pyr-GC/MS in real-world road dust samples.
