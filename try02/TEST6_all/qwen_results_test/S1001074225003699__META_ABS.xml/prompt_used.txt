You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-sampling Estimation of Waste Composition Based on Incineration Flue Gas Pollutant Fingerprints and Machine Learning Approach Understanding mixed waste composition is crucial for controlling pollutants in incineration flue gas. Real-time detection of pollutants is challenging owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of mixed waste, complicating incineration optimization and pollutant control. This study introduces a novel method to rapidly predict mixed waste composition using waste incineration flue gas “fingerprint” and machine learning regression models, bypassing traditional sampling processes. A comprehensive “fingerprint” dataset was established via incineration experiments with various mixed waste compositions, featuring multiple waste components and their associated flue gas pollutant concentrations. Predictive performance was compared for five machine learning models, including extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBOOST), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and support vector regression (SVR). After feature importance analysis optimization, RF and XGBOOST models achieved the best performance, with R² values exceeding 0.92 for key waste types. The accuracy of the models in predicting waste composition was significantly improved compared to that without optimization. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed method enables near real-time waste composition estimation, offering significant advantages for dynamic adjustment of feedstock and operating parameters. This facilitates intelligent incineration control, enhances energy efficiency, and supports proactive pollution management at the emission source.
