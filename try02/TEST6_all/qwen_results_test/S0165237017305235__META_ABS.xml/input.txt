Microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of Ageratina adenophora and kerogen with CaO and ZSM-5 Microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of Ageratina adenophora, kerogen and their mixtures with CaO and ZSM-5 catalysts are implemented in a microwave-induced reactor. The effects of reaction temperature and CaO/ZSM-5 mass ratio on pyrolysis product yields and selectivities of MACFP of pure Ageratina adenophora and kerogen are investigated. A maximum carbon yield of petrochemicals (aromatics+C2-C4 olefins+C5 compounds) from Ageratina adenophora of 21.9% is obtained at a temperature of 550°C and CaO/ZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3. A maximum petrochemical yield from kerogen of 54.8% is obtained at a temperature of 650°C and CaO/ZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3. Likewise, the MACFP of Ageratina adenophora and kerogen mixtures is conducted and the effects of reaction temperature and overall effective hydrogen index (EHI) of feedstock are studied. The highest carbon yield of petrochemicals from Ageratina adenophora and kerogen mixtures is gained at a temperature of 600°C. Additionally, it is observed that co-feeding Ageratina adenophora with kerogen can facilitate hydrocarbon production and thus show a postive synergy. The carbon yield of petrochemicals from co-feeding is higher than running these two feedstocks under their respective optimal reaction temperatures when EHI is at the range of 0.4–1.0. Besides, coke formation can be inhibited during catalytic co-feeding pyrolysis. These findings from this study pave a new route for biorefinery industries to produce developed products from Ageratina adenophora and kerogen through microwave-induced technologies.
