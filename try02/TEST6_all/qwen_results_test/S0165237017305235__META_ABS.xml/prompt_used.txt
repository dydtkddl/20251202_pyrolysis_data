You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of Ageratina adenophora and kerogen with CaO and ZSM-5 Microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of Ageratina adenophora, kerogen and their mixtures with CaO and ZSM-5 catalysts are implemented in a microwave-induced reactor. The effects of reaction temperature and CaO/ZSM-5 mass ratio on pyrolysis product yields and selectivities of MACFP of pure Ageratina adenophora and kerogen are investigated. A maximum carbon yield of petrochemicals (aromatics+C2-C4 olefins+C5 compounds) from Ageratina adenophora of 21.9% is obtained at a temperature of 550°C and CaO/ZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3. A maximum petrochemical yield from kerogen of 54.8% is obtained at a temperature of 650°C and CaO/ZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3. Likewise, the MACFP of Ageratina adenophora and kerogen mixtures is conducted and the effects of reaction temperature and overall effective hydrogen index (EHI) of feedstock are studied. The highest carbon yield of petrochemicals from Ageratina adenophora and kerogen mixtures is gained at a temperature of 600°C. Additionally, it is observed that co-feeding Ageratina adenophora with kerogen can facilitate hydrocarbon production and thus show a postive synergy. The carbon yield of petrochemicals from co-feeding is higher than running these two feedstocks under their respective optimal reaction temperatures when EHI is at the range of 0.4–1.0. Besides, coke formation can be inhibited during catalytic co-feeding pyrolysis. These findings from this study pave a new route for biorefinery industries to produce developed products from Ageratina adenophora and kerogen through microwave-induced technologies.
