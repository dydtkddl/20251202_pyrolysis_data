You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biodegradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate): Mechanistic insights, advances, and future innovative strategies Globally, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the most utilized class of thermoplastic single-use polyesters, accumulating in ecosystems and aggravating ecological pollution. There are several physicochemical and thermal treatments available that are energy intensive and further lead to the generation of secondary pollutants, toxic byproducts, and lethal gases. Biological method is an up-rising technique that has a unanimous potential for PET degradation recycling and monomer recovery owing to the presence of hydrolysable ester bonds. However, enzymatic PET degradation still has numerous limitations, such as slow processing times and low degradation rates, which limit competing with upscaling routes to achieve industrial levels. In the present review, PET degradation via microbial and enzymatic pathways is discussed, along with mechanisms and parameters that influence biodegradation. Subsequently, numerous innovative strategies are discussed, including enzyme engineering and modification via mutagenesis, enzyme cooperativity, multiple enzyme utilization, enzyme-substrate interactions, expanded substrate specificity, and improvement of reaction conditions. Lastly, the review concludes with the future perspectives in the biodegradation and subsequent biotransformation of PET wastes to produce value-added compounds with the involvement of computational biology and automation approach including Industry 4.0, deep learning, and IoT.
