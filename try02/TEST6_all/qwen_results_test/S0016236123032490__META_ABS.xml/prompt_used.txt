You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Capture effect of K and Pb by kaolin during co-firing of coal and wheat straw: Experimental and theoretical methods To reduce the emission of Pb in coal combustion and K in biomass combustion respectively, kaolin was applied widely as the in-furnace sorbent. In this study, effect of kaolin on K and Pb simultaneously in co-firing of coal and wheat straw (WS) was investigated in a lab-scale bubble fluidized bed. Relative distribution of the two elements was respectively compared with the conditions of the individual fuel combustion. Mechanism of reactions among coal, WS and kaolin was investigated via sample analysis and theory calculation. Experimental results indicated that kaolin could exert negative effect on the release of the two elements by transferring them into fly ash and bottom solid and the effect was promoted with the increasing temperature. During co-firing, sulfation reaction of K was superior to the capture reaction of K by kaolin at low temperatures while adsorption of K was slightly enhanced compared with the theory value based on results of the two individual fuels. Oppositely, the capture effect of Pb in co-firing was impaired to some extent. Lastly, result of DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculation proved that existence of KCl inhibited the adsorption of PbCl2 on metakaolin by occupying the optimum adsorption site and reducing the adsorption energy at high temperatures.
