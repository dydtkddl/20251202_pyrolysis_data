Catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic wastes from public places to liquid oil: A case of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal This study addresses the challenge of plastic waste disposal by exploring its potential as an alternative fuel source. It investigates the conversion of a plastic waste mixture (20 % LDPE, 40 % HDPE, and 40 % PET) into liquid fuel through catalytic pyrolysis. Using a custom-designed small-scale pyrolysis plant, the plastic samples were converted into liquid fuel with the aid of locally sourced bentonite powder as a catalyst, at temperatures ranging from 250 °C to 450 °C. Results demonstrate that the oil yield increases with both temperature and use of bentonite powder as a catalyst. At 450 °C, 351±7.64 ml of liquid oil was produced with 10 g of catalyst, increasing to 355±4.17 ml with 15 g and 358±2.65 ml with 20 g, using 1 Kg of plastic waste sample. The retention time is reduced from 1.5 h without a catalyst to 30 min with it. A 20 % liquid oil and 80 % gasoline blend demonstrated comparable power, torque, and engine temperature with respect to standard gasoline, achieving a mileage of 19.64±1.55 Km/L, engine torque of 1.37 Nm and engine temperature of 110 °C at 3000 rpm, though higher blends show diminished performance. Key limitations include a low cetane number (43.8), use of old motorcycles, and lack of advanced chemical analysis (GC–MS/FTIR). Despite this, the study bridges lab research to practical application via intermediate-scale experiments and real-engine tests with a low-cost local catalyst. While further refining and emissions testing are needed, it highlights pyrolysis oil's potential as a sustainable fuel in the future.
