You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Symmetrical distribution of P sites on thorn assembled Graphite carbon nitride microtube for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to form value-added fuels is a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate climate changes and achieve carbon neutral. Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is one of the potential candidates for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but limited by its low specifical surface area and absence of active sites. Here, we design a thorn grown tubular g-C3N4 (ThCN) with P sites by pyrolysis of supramolecular precursors prepared from melamine and hexachlorocyclo-triphosphonitrile (HCCP). ThCN offers an extraordinary photocatalytic activity in CO2 conversion with a yield of 442.2 μmol g−1 (170.1 μmol g−1 for CH4 and 272.1 μmol g−1 for CO) under AM 1.5G irradiation. The technique of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) enables the identification of a series of key intermediates involved in the production of CO and CH4 with high activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that ThCN with rich N-P-N sites reduce barrier energy from CO2 to COOH* and CHO* intermediate, which is beneficial to subsequent reduction process to produce CO and CH4. This work provides a significant insight into regulating molecule structure and morphology of g-C3N4 photocatalysts to promote the CO2 conversion process.
