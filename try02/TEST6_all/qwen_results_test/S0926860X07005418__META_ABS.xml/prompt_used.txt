You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of the deactivation process of HZSM5 zeolite during polyethylene pyrolysis The deactivation process of HZSM5 zeolite during the catalytic degradation of LDPE and HDPE has been studied by repeated batch operation using the same sample of catalyst in consecutive cycles until almost a total loss in the activity of the catalyst was observed. The gaseous and condensed products generated in each cycle were analysed as well as the coked catalyst obtained. They were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and thermogravimetric analysis. The deactivation process of HZSM5 depends on the type of polyethylene used. With LDPE the zeolite showed a slow deactivation. In the first four consecutive cycles the coke deposit increased, significantly changing the properties of the catalyst although the yield of gaseous and condensed products remained nearly constant throughout. From the fifth cycle on no more coke was deposited on the catalyst but the composition of products changed progressively, tending to that obtained in a thermal process. This behaviour could be related to the change in coke composition because of the effect of the temperature and the time. On the other hand, with HDPE, a clear relationship of the coke content, acidity, activity and textural properties of the catalyst with the products generated was observed.
