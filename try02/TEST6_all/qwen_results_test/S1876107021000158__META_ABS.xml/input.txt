Novel Fe/B-ZSM-5 nanocatalyst development for catalytic cracking of plastic to valuable products The plastic wastes and their long-term stability significantly threaten the environment. In this work, the catalytic cracking of plastic was investigated over the multi-functional zeolite nanocatalysts in a dual-zone fixed bed reactor. The nanocatalysts were synthesized hydrothermally, including boron promoter in the structure, followed by multi-step impregnation of iron promoter. The structural and acidity properties were characterized by FE-SEM, XRD, BET, TG-DTA, NH3-TPD, and FT-IR analyzes. The iron species was uniformly dispersed over the nanocatalysts without important framework damage. The nanocatalysts had high surface area, high mesopore volume, and spherical morphology. The effect of different loadings of Fe promoter (0–10 wt.%) was studied. The 5 wt.% Fe promoter resulted in the appropriate textural-acidity conditions. The 5Fe/B-ZSM-5 nanocatalyst had the best product distribution in gasoline range hydrocarbons (C5–12), including high aromatics (76.9%), high isoparaffins (6.2%), and high olefins (11.9%), which contains 95% of the liquid product. The nanocatalyst showed the low coke tendency (3.6%) and the high potential of reusability, including less than 10% drop in the performance through the sequence runs.
