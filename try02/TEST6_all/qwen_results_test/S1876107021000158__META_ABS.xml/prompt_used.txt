You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel Fe/B-ZSM-5 nanocatalyst development for catalytic cracking of plastic to valuable products The plastic wastes and their long-term stability significantly threaten the environment. In this work, the catalytic cracking of plastic was investigated over the multi-functional zeolite nanocatalysts in a dual-zone fixed bed reactor. The nanocatalysts were synthesized hydrothermally, including boron promoter in the structure, followed by multi-step impregnation of iron promoter. The structural and acidity properties were characterized by FE-SEM, XRD, BET, TG-DTA, NH3-TPD, and FT-IR analyzes. The iron species was uniformly dispersed over the nanocatalysts without important framework damage. The nanocatalysts had high surface area, high mesopore volume, and spherical morphology. The effect of different loadings of Fe promoter (0–10 wt.%) was studied. The 5 wt.% Fe promoter resulted in the appropriate textural-acidity conditions. The 5Fe/B-ZSM-5 nanocatalyst had the best product distribution in gasoline range hydrocarbons (C5–12), including high aromatics (76.9%), high isoparaffins (6.2%), and high olefins (11.9%), which contains 95% of the liquid product. The nanocatalyst showed the low coke tendency (3.6%) and the high potential of reusability, including less than 10% drop in the performance through the sequence runs.
