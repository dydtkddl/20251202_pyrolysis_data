Reactive behaviors and mechanisms of cellulose in chemical looping combustions with iron-based oxygen carriers: An experimental combined with ReaxFF MD study Biomass energy is one of the important and feasible renewable energy resources. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) can meet the requirements of efficient CO2 capture with low energy consumption. The combination of the two factors is intuitive and important for realizing carbon neutral energy processing and conversion. Cellulose is the component with the highest content in biomass. However, there is still a lack of clear understanding of the thermal conversion behavior and microscopic reaction mechanism of cellulose in CLC. In this work, the behaviors and mechanisms of cellulose in CLC with iron-based OCs were studied systematically based on the comprehensive technics of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments, kinetic models and molecular dynamic simulations. The reaction behaviors, kinetic mechanism, and complex reactive networks of cellulose under complex environmental interface conditions of CLC were revealed. Three different stages were revealed for thermal weight loss and reaction behavior of cellulose in CLC via TGA. The effects of different conversion rates and reaction stages on activation energy during CLC were described based on two model-free integration methods. The dynamic evolution of the CLC process was discussed by ReaxFF MD (reactive force field molecular dynamics) simulations. A complex reaction network of cellulose depolymerization and CO2 release in CLC was obtained.
