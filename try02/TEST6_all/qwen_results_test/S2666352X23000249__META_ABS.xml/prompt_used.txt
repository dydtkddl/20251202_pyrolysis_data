You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reactive behaviors and mechanisms of cellulose in chemical looping combustions with iron-based oxygen carriers: An experimental combined with ReaxFF MD study Biomass energy is one of the important and feasible renewable energy resources. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) can meet the requirements of efficient CO2 capture with low energy consumption. The combination of the two factors is intuitive and important for realizing carbon neutral energy processing and conversion. Cellulose is the component with the highest content in biomass. However, there is still a lack of clear understanding of the thermal conversion behavior and microscopic reaction mechanism of cellulose in CLC. In this work, the behaviors and mechanisms of cellulose in CLC with iron-based OCs were studied systematically based on the comprehensive technics of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments, kinetic models and molecular dynamic simulations. The reaction behaviors, kinetic mechanism, and complex reactive networks of cellulose under complex environmental interface conditions of CLC were revealed. Three different stages were revealed for thermal weight loss and reaction behavior of cellulose in CLC via TGA. The effects of different conversion rates and reaction stages on activation energy during CLC were described based on two model-free integration methods. The dynamic evolution of the CLC process was discussed by ReaxFF MD (reactive force field molecular dynamics) simulations. A complex reaction network of cellulose depolymerization and CO2 release in CLC was obtained.
