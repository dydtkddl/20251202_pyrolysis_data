You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-isothermal and isothermal co-pyrolysis characteristics of coal gangue/coal slime and pine sawdust: Thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed pyrolysis reactor study The generation and accumulation of coal gangue (CG) and coal slime (CS) are a serious cause of environmental pollution. The co-pyrolysis of CG/CS and pine sawdust (PS) is an effective method to reduce pollution and waste generation. In this work, the co-pyrolysis characteristics of CG/CS and PS were analyzed by the thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed pyrolysis reactor. The kinetics analysis showed that the activation energies decreased with the PS mixing ratio increased for CG/PS blends and CS/PS blends in the second pyrolysis stage. The synergistic effect on yield is quantified by comparing the results of the co-pyrolysis of CG/CS and PS blends with weighted results from the pyrolysis of CG, CS and PS individually. The results revealed that when the mixing ratio of CG:PS was 1:1, the difference between the experimental and calculated yields (2.9 %) and the H2 yield (320 ml/g) were maximum. Among the CS/PS blends, these values are maximum when the mixing ratio of CS:PS is 3:1 (2.5 % and 450 ml/g). Furthermore, the alkali and alkaline earth metals K and Ca in the co-pyrolysis char catalyze the decomposition of the –OH functional group.
