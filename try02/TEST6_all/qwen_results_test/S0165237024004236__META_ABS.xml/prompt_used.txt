You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Behaviors and mechanism of volatiles producing during coal pyrolysis with calcium oxide loading: Insights from model compounds analysis Calcium is a highly effective catalyst for controlling the tar compounds produced during the pyrolysis of low-rank coal, forming valuable end products. However, the exact catalytic mechanism of calcium in coal pyrolysis remains unclear due to the complex nature of coal. In this study, the pyrolysis process and tar composition of lignite, both with and without the addition of calcium, were investigated across three distinct temperature intervals. The addition of calcium oxide increased the hydrocarbon content of tar by 16.39 % in the low-temperature range and 26.53 % in the intermediate-temperature range. Four model compounds containing different coal-related functional groups were selected to investigate the effects of calcium on pyrolysis performance and tar composition using thermogravimetric analysis, fixed bed reactor experiments, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The addition of calcium did not affect the thermal decomposition of polystyrene or polyethylene terephthalate; however, the primary pyrolysates underwent secondary reactions on the surface of calcium, which affected the composition of the liquid pyrolysis product. Meanwhile, calcium interacted with the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups in trimeric acid and phenolic resin to form carboxylates and phenates, which affected the thermal reaction and distribution of liquid products. The influence of calcium on the transformation mechanism of coal-related functional groups provides a theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of calcium-catalyzed coal pyrolysis.
