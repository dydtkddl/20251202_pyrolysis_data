You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MvK mechanism dominated methane combustion over Ni-CeO2 derived from MOF by flame pyrolysis Methane catalytic combustion is a significant technique in the fields of enhanced combustion, methane removal, and methane detection with the development of the natural gas industry and the demand for low-carbon combustion. Here, using a facile flame pyrolysis technique, two different types of Ni-CeO2 catalysts for methane combustion were synthesized from metal-organic framework (MOF) and metal salt (MS). Moreover, the Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism was investigated by combining kinetics with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The performance shows that Ni-CeO2(BTC) catalysts give high activity owing to the large surface area, abundant Ni cations, and adsorbed oxygen. The high intrinsic activity is also related to a large number of oxygen vacancies which are essential for the MvK mechanism. In terms of kinetic analysis, the methane concentration determines the catalysis, and a redox MvK mechanism shows a good description of the experimental results. DFT calculations further clarify that, according to the MvK mechanism, the reduction of the active site is via dissociative adsorption of CH of CH4 on the catalytic site NiOCe, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy, followed by dissociation of gas-phase oxygen on the oxygen vacancy to reoxidize the active site. Summarily, the MvK mechanism dominates the methane heterogeneous combustion over Ni-CeO2 and provides insight into the catalyst design for strengthening combustion.
