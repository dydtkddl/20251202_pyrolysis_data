Feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of biodegradable plastics with food waste, investigation of microbial diversity and digestate phytotoxicity The effects of biodegradable plastics of different thicknesses (30 and 40 μm) and sizes (20 × 20, 2 × 2, and 1 × 1 mm) on anaerobic digestion of food waste and digestate phytotoxicity were investigated. Methane productions (38 days) for the groups with 20 × 20, 2 × 2, and 1 × 1 mm of 30 μm plastics were 92.46, 138.27, and 259.95 mL/gVSremoval, respectively which are nearly 58 % higher than the control group (58.86 mL/gVSremoval). Methane production in 40 μm plastics groups was lower than in 30 μm groups of equal size. All sizes of 30 µm plastics promoted substrate hydrolysis, acidification, and relative abundance of key hydrolytic bacteria and methanogens. Phytotoxicity tests results showed that seed root elongation was inhibited in groups with 40 μm plastics. In conclusion, 30 μm biodegradable plastics were more suitable for anaerobic digestion with food waste than 40 μm.
