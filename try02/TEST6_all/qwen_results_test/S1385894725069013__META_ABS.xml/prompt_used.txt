You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hierarchical multi-shell hollow porous NiO/Co3O4 nanospheres with enhanced dielectric-magnetic synergy for high-efficiency microwave absorption In response to the increasing challenges posed by electromagnetic pollution, The development of high-performance microwave absorbing materials is increasingly urgent. This study addresses this challenge through synergistic engineering of hierarchical architectures and magnetic-dielectric components, proposing a sequential templating strategy to fabricate hierarchical multi-shell hollow porous (HMSHP) NiO/Co3O4 nanospheres. Systematic characterization reveals that the HMSHP architecture can effectively improve the impedance matching, reduce the material density, extend the microwave transmission path, and significantly enhance the conduction loss and interface polarization loss. In addition, the NiO/Co3O4 heterointerfaces induce polarization loss caused by lattice defects in the shell and magnetic loss due to the magnetic metal oxide components, which synergistically enhance electromagnetic energy conversion. The 3-shell hollow porous NiO/Co3O4 nanospheres (3-NCO) demonstrated superior microwave absorption performance. Specifically, at a low filler ratio (20 wt%) and a thin thickness (2.1 mm), the 3-NCO nanospheres exhibited a significant absorption capacity (−67.62 dB) and a wide effective absorption bandwidth (7.68 GHz). This work reveals a nanostructure design route for designing lightweight, broadband microwave absorbers through rational integration of structural hierarchy and interfacial engineering, offering actionable strategy to fabricating novel microwave absorption nanomaterials.
