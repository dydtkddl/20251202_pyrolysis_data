You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

TG-FTIR investigations of the pyrolysis of polyurethanes: Quantitative carbon dioxide tracing, decomposition mechanisms, products and mass balances for advanced recycling Polyurethanes (PUR) are versatile polymers used in a broad range of applications. Conventional mechanical recycling is thus difficult. Chemical recycling such as pyrolytic waste treatment presents new recycling options. Advanced recycling by pyrolysis may help to reduce environmental impacts from PUR wastes. The knowledge of mechanisms, products and yields is essential for the design of efficient pyrolysis processes. Rigid (RPUF) and flexible foams (FPUF), a cast elastomer (CE) and a thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) have been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and FTIR-spectroscopy. Two decomposition steps have been identified. CO2 is mainly released in the first decomposition step between 250 °C and 400 °C. The second decomposition step at temperatures above 400 °C releases polyol fragments and marginal amounts of CO2. Strong feedstock dependency is evident. Quantitative tracing for the CO2 release was developed, validated and applied. This allows the resolution of specific decomposition phenomena, mass balancing and distinguishing potentially valuable volatiles from CO2 and solid residues. CO2 yields are 12.0 mass-% for RPUF, 4.0 mass-% for FPUF, 3.2 mass-% for CE and 5.3 mass-% for TPU. Considering solids and CO2 as losses, recycling potentials were determined which are 74 mass-% for RPUF, 90 mass-% for FPUF, 95 mass% for CE and 93 mass-% for TPU. This facilitates further process development based on polymer-specific data.
