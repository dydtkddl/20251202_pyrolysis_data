Assessing the potential for upscaling the continuous production of lignin oils through reductive catalytic depolymerization Lignin represents up to one third of lignocellulosic biomass and is a sustainable carbon source available at a sufficient scale to replace an impactful amount of fossil resources when converted into materials and chemicals. The molecular structure of lignin renders it ideal to obtain renewable aromatic building blocks for the polymer industry. Nevertheless, in polymeric form, lignin poses serious challenges for material applications and chemical conversion, namely poor solubility, and low reactivity. This problem can be circumvented by depolymerization of isolated lignins. To meet the demand for renewable aromatic building blocks, it is crucial to utilize technical lignin streams generated on large scale. This will eventually allow the development of continuous, high-throughput processes which are required for viable industrial-scale operations. Our work demonstrates for the first time that “technical grade” hydrolysis lignin from an operating biorefinery can be successfully subjected to continuous reductive catalytic depolymerization (RCD) in a packed bed reactor using a commercially available Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The impact of catalyst amount, feed concentration (in methanol), and temperature with regards to process stability and product quality was investigated. The product was characterized by NMR, GPC, and GC-FID. Feed concentrations up to 7 wt% could be continuously processed for 77 h at 200 °C whereas at 225 °C, the operation time was restricted to 22 h. In all cases, a stable output was obtained over time in terms of molar mass, OH-group distributions, and monomer content. At 200 °C, carbon yields above 90 % of the soluble lignin fraction were feasible.
