You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing the potential for upscaling the continuous production of lignin oils through reductive catalytic depolymerization Lignin represents up to one third of lignocellulosic biomass and is a sustainable carbon source available at a sufficient scale to replace an impactful amount of fossil resources when converted into materials and chemicals. The molecular structure of lignin renders it ideal to obtain renewable aromatic building blocks for the polymer industry. Nevertheless, in polymeric form, lignin poses serious challenges for material applications and chemical conversion, namely poor solubility, and low reactivity. This problem can be circumvented by depolymerization of isolated lignins. To meet the demand for renewable aromatic building blocks, it is crucial to utilize technical lignin streams generated on large scale. This will eventually allow the development of continuous, high-throughput processes which are required for viable industrial-scale operations. Our work demonstrates for the first time that “technical grade” hydrolysis lignin from an operating biorefinery can be successfully subjected to continuous reductive catalytic depolymerization (RCD) in a packed bed reactor using a commercially available Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The impact of catalyst amount, feed concentration (in methanol), and temperature with regards to process stability and product quality was investigated. The product was characterized by NMR, GPC, and GC-FID. Feed concentrations up to 7 wt% could be continuously processed for 77 h at 200 °C whereas at 225 °C, the operation time was restricted to 22 h. In all cases, a stable output was obtained over time in terms of molar mass, OH-group distributions, and monomer content. At 200 °C, carbon yields above 90 % of the soluble lignin fraction were feasible.
