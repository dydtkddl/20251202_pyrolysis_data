You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the synergistic efficacy of sonication-assisted water treatment process with special attention given to microplastics The rampant spread of microplastic pollution in both natural and industrial water bodies has emerged as a paramount environmental concern. Regrettably, conventional water treatment methods (e.g., adsorption, membrane filtration, coagulation-flocculation, and electrocoagulation, processes) have been discovered to be inadequately effective in tackling this issue. However, the advent of sonication-assisted water treatment technologies has shown great promise in curbing microplastic pollution. This review article expounds on the latest trends in sonication-assisted water treatment technologies for microplastic removal. A comparison between conventional water treatment methods and sonication-assisted procedures elucidates the pros and cons of each were conducted. Additionally, an exploration of various sonication-assisted techniques and their potent efficacy in removing microplastics was undertaken. Sonochemical, Sonoelectrochemical, Sonophotocatalytic, Sonofenton, and Sonoelectrocatalytic, may be used for microplastics (MPs) removal, it has been demonstrated that ultrasonic frequencies between 100 and 1000 kHz for the sonochemical process are more useful than frequencies below 20 kHz. Generally, sonication methods have good compatibility and attachment to other biological or physical processes and increase the cavitation-induced concentration of the reactive radical in the bulk phase. Also, When Fenton processes are combined with sonication, the number of ferrous ions present in the treated water decreases due to easy handling, quick degradation, and a wide pH range that can be used. The economic aspects are the biggest challenges in synergistic efficacy of sonication-assisted water treatment for microplastics mitigation. The paramount importance of continued research and development to refine and optimize sonication-assisted water treatment technologies for practical implementation was concluded.
