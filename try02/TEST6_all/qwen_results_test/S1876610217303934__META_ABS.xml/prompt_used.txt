You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pilot Test of Co-pyrolysis Characteristics of Wet Sewage Sludge and Sawdust in an External Heating Moving Bed The process of traditional sludge treatment is complex and high energy consumption. A drying and pyrolysis integration technology of high moisture sludge was put forward. On the basis of experimental study, the pilot study was carried out. Co-pyrolysis characteristics of wet sewage sludge and sawdust for syngas production was studied in this paper. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that the addition of sawdust accelerated the pyrolysis reactions. Moreover, the weight loss and mass loss rate also increased with sawdust proportion augmenting. The mixture with 60 wt. % wet sewage sludge and 40 wt. % sawdust was pyrolyzed in a self-designed external heating moving bed pilot scale device with the capacity of 200 kg/h. Results showed that with pyrolysis carrying out, H2 content was increasing from 33.62% to 47.71% and the volumetric concentration of fuel gas including was also gradually increasing. The heat value of pyrolysis gas mainly distributed between 15∼18 MJ/ Nm3, which is appreciable for industrial applications and provides a new idea for direct pyrolysis of sewage sludge.
