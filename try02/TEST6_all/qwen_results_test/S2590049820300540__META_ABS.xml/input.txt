Nanostructured boron nitride–based materials: synthesis and applications Nanocomposite materials are widely studied because of their unique design opportunities and properties. They can be classified into three main groups in function of the matrix used: polymer-based, ceramic-based, and metal-based nanocomposites. The nanofiller choice is one of the most important steps because it will improve the nanocomposite properties. This review focuses on boron nitride as nanofiller because of its extraordinary properties: high thermal and chemical stability, good mechanical strength, superior resistance to oxidation, good thermal conductivity, and electrical insulation. The goal of this review is to provide an overview on the synthesis methods to produce boron nitride–based nanocomposites, particularly polymer- and ceramic-based nanocomposites, and on their potential applications in promising fields, such as energy, environment, and health.
