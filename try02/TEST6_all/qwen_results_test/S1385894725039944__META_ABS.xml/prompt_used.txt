You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective hydrogenation of C8 aromatics in pyrolysis gasoline on Ni3CuSn0.3/SiO2 catalyst: Reaction kinetics and reactor modeling Styrene is a key monomer in the petrochemical industry and can be recovered from pyrolysis gasoline (PYGAS). To prevent trace amounts of phenylacetylene from contaminating styrene, which could lead to downstream catalyst poisoning and product specification issues, selective hydrogenation is commonly employed to remove phenylacetylene. This study investigates the reaction kinetics and reactor modeling for the selective hydrogenation of the C8 aromatic fraction in PYGAS over a high-efficiency Ni3CuSn0.3/SiO2 catalyst. First, kinetic experiments were conducted in a semi-batch stirred tank reactor using catalyst powder. A power-law kinetic model was established, yielding intrinsic activation energies of 46.33 kJ/mol for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene and 68.95 kJ/mol for the conversion of styrene to ethylbenzene. Subsequently, the effects of reaction temperature (50–90 °C), pressure (0.4–1.4 MPa), H2/phenylethylene molar ratio (4–14), and feed phenylethylene concentration (0–4 wt%) on the selective hydrogenation of C8 aromatics were examined in a continuous fixed-bed reactor with catalyst pellets. A mathematical model incorporating both external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion–reaction effects was developed to describe the hydrogenation process in the fixed-bed reactor. The experimental results validated the model’s accuracy, supporing its application in future reactor design and optimization of operating conditions.
