Selective hydrogenation of C8 aromatics in pyrolysis gasoline on Ni3CuSn0.3/SiO2 catalyst: Reaction kinetics and reactor modeling Styrene is a key monomer in the petrochemical industry and can be recovered from pyrolysis gasoline (PYGAS). To prevent trace amounts of phenylacetylene from contaminating styrene, which could lead to downstream catalyst poisoning and product specification issues, selective hydrogenation is commonly employed to remove phenylacetylene. This study investigates the reaction kinetics and reactor modeling for the selective hydrogenation of the C8 aromatic fraction in PYGAS over a high-efficiency Ni3CuSn0.3/SiO2 catalyst. First, kinetic experiments were conducted in a semi-batch stirred tank reactor using catalyst powder. A power-law kinetic model was established, yielding intrinsic activation energies of 46.33 kJ/mol for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene and 68.95 kJ/mol for the conversion of styrene to ethylbenzene. Subsequently, the effects of reaction temperature (50–90 °C), pressure (0.4–1.4 MPa), H2/phenylethylene molar ratio (4–14), and feed phenylethylene concentration (0–4 wt%) on the selective hydrogenation of C8 aromatics were examined in a continuous fixed-bed reactor with catalyst pellets. A mathematical model incorporating both external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion–reaction effects was developed to describe the hydrogenation process in the fixed-bed reactor. The experimental results validated the model’s accuracy, supporing its application in future reactor design and optimization of operating conditions.
