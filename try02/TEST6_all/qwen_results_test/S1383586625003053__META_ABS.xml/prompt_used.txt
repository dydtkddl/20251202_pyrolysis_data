You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction behaviors and mechanisms of in-situ carbothermal reduction in spent lithium batteries The improper disposal of spent lithium batteries, containing valuable metals, poses environmental risks, necessitating efficient recycling methods. In-situ carbothermal reduction (ICTR) technology, employed in spent lithium batteries recycling, holds potential for reducing reaction temperatures and energy consumption. This study employs analytical techniques and computational simulations to explore the characteristics, deconstructive mechanisms, and pathways of the lithium nickel–cobalt-manganate oxide (NCM523) and graphite (C) in ICTR. The structure of NCM523 is stable and remains stable at high temperatures in nitrogen atmosphere, but high temperatures lower the chemical valences of Ni and Mn elements. The rate of loss Li ions from pyrolysis of NCM523 at 900 °C was 14.56%, and the ICTR had reduced Li ion loss rate at the same reaction temperature. ICTR can significantly reduce the reduction reaction temperature of Ni, Co and Mn elements of batteries. Optimal conditions entail pyrolyzing NCM523 and C at a 7:3 or 6:4 ratio at 900 °C for 30 minutes. The ICTR mechanism proceeds in three stages: the initial stage (<500 °C), adsorption deconstruction stage (500–700 °C), and decomposition stage (700–900 °C). The findings offer mechanistic insights for environmentally sustainable recovery in the lithium battery industry.
