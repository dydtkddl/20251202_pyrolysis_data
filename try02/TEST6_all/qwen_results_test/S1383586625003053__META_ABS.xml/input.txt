Reaction behaviors and mechanisms of in-situ carbothermal reduction in spent lithium batteries The improper disposal of spent lithium batteries, containing valuable metals, poses environmental risks, necessitating efficient recycling methods. In-situ carbothermal reduction (ICTR) technology, employed in spent lithium batteries recycling, holds potential for reducing reaction temperatures and energy consumption. This study employs analytical techniques and computational simulations to explore the characteristics, deconstructive mechanisms, and pathways of the lithium nickel–cobalt-manganate oxide (NCM523) and graphite (C) in ICTR. The structure of NCM523 is stable and remains stable at high temperatures in nitrogen atmosphere, but high temperatures lower the chemical valences of Ni and Mn elements. The rate of loss Li ions from pyrolysis of NCM523 at 900 °C was 14.56%, and the ICTR had reduced Li ion loss rate at the same reaction temperature. ICTR can significantly reduce the reduction reaction temperature of Ni, Co and Mn elements of batteries. Optimal conditions entail pyrolyzing NCM523 and C at a 7:3 or 6:4 ratio at 900 °C for 30 minutes. The ICTR mechanism proceeds in three stages: the initial stage (<500 °C), adsorption deconstruction stage (500–700 °C), and decomposition stage (700–900 °C). The findings offer mechanistic insights for environmentally sustainable recovery in the lithium battery industry.
