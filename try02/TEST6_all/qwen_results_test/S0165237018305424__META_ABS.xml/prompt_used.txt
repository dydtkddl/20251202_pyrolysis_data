You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of acetonitrile via catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass derived polylactic acid under ammonia atmosphere In this study, a series of catalysts including different metal oxides loading on HZSM-5(Si/Al = 25) and cobalt oxides loading on different supports were synthesized to catalyze fast pyrolysis (CFP) of biomass derived polylactic acid (PLA) to produce acetonitrile under ammonia atmosphere. Both the metal and the acid of the catalyst had a crucial influence on the yield of acetonitrile and Co/HZSM-5(25) produced most acetonitrile. Other factors that might affect the product distribution including cobalt loading, reaction temperature, resident time and NH3 flow rate have been investigated systematically. Under the optimized CFP condition (650 ℃; resident time 2.4 s; NH3 flow rate 80 ml/min), the carbon yield and selectivity of acetonitrile in liquid product reached 50.2% and 83.6%, respectively. The possible reaction pathway from PLA to acetonitrile was also studied and proposed. PLA firstly cracked into lactic acid through thermal decomposition and formed lactide at the same time. Then lactic acid and lactide cracked into low-molecular aldehydes, ketones and acids. These aldehydes and ketones reacted with ammonia to form imines, acids to amides, and finally to acetonitrile and small amount of proponitrile under the catalysis of Co/HZSM-5 catalyst.
