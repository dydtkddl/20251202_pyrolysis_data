You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of reference metal and metal oxide engineered nanomaterials for nanotoxicology research using high throughput and precision flame spray synthesis approaches There is a growing need to develop and characterize reference metal and metal oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) of high purity and tunable intrinsic properties suitable for nanotoxicology research. Here a high throughput (volume) and precision flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) approach coupled with state-of-the-art characterization techniques are utilized to generate such reference ENMs. The lab-based and industrially relevant FSP system, termed as Versatile Engineered Nanomaterials Generation System (VENGES), synthesizes the metals and metal oxides, at high throughput manner with controlled properties, such as primary particle size, aggregate diameter, shape, crystallinity, stoichiometry and surface chemistry. A nanopanel of nine reference ENMs (silica, silver, silver supported on silica, alumina, ceria and iron oxide) was synthesized and characterized using combined electron microscopy, advanced spectroscopic techniques and physical analyses (e.g., BET, XRD, TEM, pycnometry, XPS, ICP-MS and FTIR). ENMs show a high degree of chemical purity and stoichiometry, and low content of carbon residuals, and are sterile and free of bacteria and endotoxins. Further, their colloidal properties and their implication in in-vitro dosimetry have been also investigated in both environmental and test biological media. The suitability of reference ENMs and protocols developed in this study brings forth new arenas to generate reliable and reproducible toxicological data in an effort to reduce conflicting and contradicting inter-laboratory data on relative toxic effects of ENMs.
