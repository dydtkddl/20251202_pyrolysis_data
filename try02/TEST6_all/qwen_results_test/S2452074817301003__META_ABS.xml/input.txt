Development of reference metal and metal oxide engineered nanomaterials for nanotoxicology research using high throughput and precision flame spray synthesis approaches There is a growing need to develop and characterize reference metal and metal oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) of high purity and tunable intrinsic properties suitable for nanotoxicology research. Here a high throughput (volume) and precision flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) approach coupled with state-of-the-art characterization techniques are utilized to generate such reference ENMs. The lab-based and industrially relevant FSP system, termed as Versatile Engineered Nanomaterials Generation System (VENGES), synthesizes the metals and metal oxides, at high throughput manner with controlled properties, such as primary particle size, aggregate diameter, shape, crystallinity, stoichiometry and surface chemistry. A nanopanel of nine reference ENMs (silica, silver, silver supported on silica, alumina, ceria and iron oxide) was synthesized and characterized using combined electron microscopy, advanced spectroscopic techniques and physical analyses (e.g., BET, XRD, TEM, pycnometry, XPS, ICP-MS and FTIR). ENMs show a high degree of chemical purity and stoichiometry, and low content of carbon residuals, and are sterile and free of bacteria and endotoxins. Further, their colloidal properties and their implication in in-vitro dosimetry have been also investigated in both environmental and test biological media. The suitability of reference ENMs and protocols developed in this study brings forth new arenas to generate reliable and reproducible toxicological data in an effort to reduce conflicting and contradicting inter-laboratory data on relative toxic effects of ENMs.
