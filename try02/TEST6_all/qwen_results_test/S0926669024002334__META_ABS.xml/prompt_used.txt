You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of tung oil derived free fatty acid by non-conventional method using novel microcrystalline cellulose based mesoporous acid catalyst for sustainable application: Process optimization using response surface methodology The catalyst plays a significant function in industrial unit processes since it allows reactants to be converted into valuable compounds via chemical reactions. However, the synthesis of FAME from edible vegetable oils, non-edible vegetable oils, and animal fats are used to synthesize FAME but, homogeneous catalysts have encountered difficulties in the synthesis of FAME. To overcome these problems, current research is focusing on the synthesis of a novel silica-supported catalyst known as the heterogeneous cellulose microcrystalline (CMBSA-Si) catalyst and its application of FAME synthesis using non-edible tung oil. Response surface methodology is used for the optimization process. According to experimental results, the following are the reaction conditions for the synthesis of FAME in the microwave with a yield of 99.99%: 15 wt% CMBSA-Si catalyst loading, 65 °C reaction temperature, 1:10 molar ratio of FFA-to-Methanol, and a reaction period of 50 min. The CMBSA-Si catalyst was characterized using FT-IR, XRD, SEM-EDAX, BET, and TGA-DTA analysis. Tung oil and FAME were also characterized using FT-IR, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. For the synthesis of FAME from non-edible tung oil, the CMBSA-Si catalyst presents a solution to the problems encountered by traditional homogeneous catalysts. This synthesized FAME further can be used to prepare polyol for its different polyurethane applications.
