You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments in photocatalytic remediation of textile effluent using semiconductor based nanostructured catalyst: A review The textile industry makes a significant contribution to the Indian economy. This textile industry creates a demand for producing 1.3 million tons of dyes and pigments and most of them are produced in a synthetic way. These Dyes are capable of absorbing and reflecting sunlight in water. This affects the photosynthetic cycle of algae and other biotic components which seriously influences the food web. Textile effluent is mostly composed of 70% of Azo dyes. However, most among those dyes and their breakdown products which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and toxic to life in nature. The recent technology that deals with treating textile effluent is heterogeneous photocatalysis which uses various types of semiconductor-based nanoparticles that have the ability to act as catalysts when accompanied with visible-light. This review focuses on the recent developments of different types of semiconductor based nano-structures which include doping, polymer supported nanocomplex, magnetic nanocomposites, heterojunction photocatalyst and newly introduced compound photo-catalysts. Polymerised Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4@polyaniline decorated BiOCl is the most efficient photocatalyst in degrading methyl orange in 60 min under visible light. Non-metal doped photocatalyst worked best for dye concentration in the range 5 mg/L to 20 mg/L. Most of the heterojunction photocatalyst was reused for 5 times and the catalytic activity resulted in the range 90–100%. Furthermore, the impact of the parameters such as dopant concentration, pH, catalyst concentration, solution concentration on the photocatalytic activity were studied.
