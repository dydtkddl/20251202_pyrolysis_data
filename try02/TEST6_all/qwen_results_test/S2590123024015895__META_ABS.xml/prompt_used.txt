You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the potential of plastic pyrolysis oil-diesel blends in diesel engine: Performance, emissions, thermodynamics and sustainability analysis The abrupt rise in demand for conventional fuels has become a major cause for concern despite their increasing depletion. That's why the pyrolysis process to make plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO), can be used to prepare fuel as an alternative fuel. The batch pyrolysis reactor was fabricated to produce plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) from locally sourced grocery bags made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The purpose of this study was to thoroughly analyze the performance and emission characteristics of an engine running on up to 15 % PPO-diesel blended fuel. Then, the experimental data obtained from a single-cylinder, four-stroke engine with five distinct speeds ranging from 1000 to 3500 rpm were utilized to undertake energy, exergy, and sustainability assessments. The results showed that DPO5 had a maximum brake power of 1.92 kW at 2500 rpm. At 3500 rpm, the engine achieved a thermal efficiency of 47.44 % for diesel and 51.6 % for DPO5 blended fuel. Furthermore, DPO15 produced the least quantity of CO2 at all engine speeds. DPO5 has the highest sustainability index, 1.52 at 2500 rpm. As a result, our research found that a low-level PPO-diesel fuel blend may be effectively injected into diesel engines without requiring any modifications.
