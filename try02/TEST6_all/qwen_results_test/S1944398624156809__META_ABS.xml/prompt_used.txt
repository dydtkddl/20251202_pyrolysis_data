You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on recent developments in the low-cost adsorption of dyes from wastewater Water is one of the most important components in the environment. This is essential for all forms of life and leisurely plays a vital role in the world economy. The discharge of large amount of dye wastewater from different industries such as textile, leather, pulp, rubber pharmaceuticals, food processing, electroplating cosmetics, plastic, paper industries, etc. to the aquatic system constitutes the major hazards to the living environment. Hence, the rapid removal of these dyes from waste-water before their discharge is an important necessity of day to day life as well as for environmental safety. Several traditional treatment methods were available for the removal of dyes from water/wastewater such as chemical coagulation, filtration, flocculation, ozonation, oxidation, photocatalytic degradation, ion exchange, biodegradation, electrolysis and adsorption. Among all these treatment methods, adsorption process using activated carbon is one of the most important, effective and reliable method for the removal of dyes from aquatic system. However, the widespread application of activated carbon is restricted because of its high cost. Therefore, the attention has moved to select the low-cost and efficient adsorbents which are alternative to the existing activated carbon. Some of the natural materials, agricultural wastes, industrial wastes and biosorbents have been reported as an effective low-cost adsorbent for the removal of dyes from aquatic system by many researchers. The current review paper explains the detailed survey on the dye removal methods, and scope for the improvement can be done on the removal of dyes from industrial wastewater.
