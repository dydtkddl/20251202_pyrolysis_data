You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adaptation of hard coal with high sinterability for solid fuel boilers in residential heating systems Solid fuels boilers with low emission and modern construction, which are used for residential heating, require coal fuel with low sinterability (RI < 15). This paper presents a process for adapting coal with high sinterability for use in small boilers in residential heating systems. This solution allows for the combustion of coals with an RI of 50 without causing negative effects (in terms of combustion stability) in typical burners used in heating devices. The proposed solution involves the delivery of fuel particles coated with an oil film (waste oil and canola oil) to the combustion chamber. Tests were performed using a commercial-scale boiler with a 17–23 kW output, equipped with a retort burner and a dosing device, which applied oil to the coal in the boiler. Tests were performed during the combustion of hard coals characterized by different sinterability, with and without various streams of oils. Emission issues are also analysed. Impregnation of the coal by canola oil caused slightly lower NOx emissions, but higher CO and dust emissions. Analyses of the basic quality parameters (i.e., coal structure after thermal treatment) show that changes in the coal properties also occurred. Based on these studies, a mechanism that explains the beneficial effect of oil presence on high sinterable coal (HSC) combustion is proposed.
