You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Perspective on the disposal of PVC artificial leather via pyrolysis: Thermodynamics, kinetics, synergistic effects and reaction mechanism With the massive production and discard of PVC artificial leather, it is urgently needed to find an efficient and environment-friendly method to dispose of this material made from PVC and blended cloth (BC). As a widely accepted way to dispose of municipal solid waste, pyrolysis was chosen for this study. The pyrolysis experiments of PVC, BC, and their mixture were conducted to characterize PVC artificial leather’s pyrolysis behavior and product characteristics. TG-FTIR and kinetics analysis showed the strong synergistic effect between PVC and cellulose in BC occurred at 240 °C – 314 °C, resulting in cellulose dehydration and aromatization. An exceptionally high tar yield of 54.96 wt% was obtained by fast pyrolysis of the mixture at 500 °C. GC–MS analysis of tar proved BC consisted of cellulose, PET, and PA. The high tar yield of co-pyrolysis came from the synergistic effects of PVC on cellulose and PET, both of which formed terephthalic acid, di(2-chloroethyl) ester (TADE). At 500 °C, the tar of the mixture mainly contained TADE (18.72 wt%), terephthalic acid (18.56 wt%), and aromatics (19.04 wt%). The co-pyrolysis interaction mechanism at 500 °C was deduced. Our study could provide theoretical guidance for recycling PVC artificial leather waste.
