You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of water spray on degradation of styrene-butadiene-rubber during accelerated weathering tests Accelerated weathering tests using a xenon lamp were performed on styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) under two conditions: only photo irradiation (photo-irradiated condition) and the addition of intermittent water spraying to photo irradiation (photo-irradiated/water-sprayed condition). Degradation mechanisms under these conditions were evaluated based on changes in chemical structure, hardness, and morphology of the exposed surface during weathering tests. The morphology of the exposed surfaces differed significantly between the two weathering conditions. Random minute cracks, known as crazes, were clearly observed under the photo-irradiated/water-sprayed condition. To clarify the origin of such craze propagation, the temperature change accompanying water spraying was traced. A combination of temperature decrease during water spraying and subsequent increase due to water evaporation was repeated under the photo-irradiated/water-sprayed condition. Such periodic temperature change caused the sample to expand and contract; however, the exposed surface could not follow this dimensional change, resulting in craze. This result indicates that water spraying is a degradation factor for accelerated weathering tests on SBR, especially change of surface shape.
