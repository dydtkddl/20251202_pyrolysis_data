You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atmospheric and high pressures pyrolysis study of n-decane in a flow reactor with online GC-MS/FID analysis: Experiments and modeling The atmospheric and high-pressure pyrolysis of n-decane was studied in a flow tube reactor combined with online GC–MS/FID at 723−1123 K, 0.1–3.0 MPa (highly diluted in helium). Compared with 0.1 MPa, the conversion of n-decane and mole fraction of alkenes clearly increased at 3.0 MPa at the fixed temperature, and more aromatics were observed including toluene, styrene, ethylbenzene, indene and naphthalene, suggesting that the secondary reactions are more intense under high pressure. To account for these differences, a detailed kinetic model with 191 species and 1117 reactions was constructed by incorporating the aromatics subset to a n-decane model developed in previous low-pressure work, and further validated against literature data covering a wide pressure range (0.004–7.2 MPa) with reasonable reproducibility. The current model was compared against three literature kinetic models (LLNL, JetSurf 2.0 and Rev1stGen) and showed a better accordant with the conversion of n-decane and the selectivity of major products. Based on the rate of production and sensitivity analysis using the current model, the results show that although the total consumption of n-decane is weakly pressure-dependent at fixed temperature and residence time under the investigated conditions, the formation and consumption pathways of primary products change significantly attributed to the enhanced bimolecular abstraction and combination reactions at higher pressures. For the formation of benzene, the combination of 1,3-butadien-2-yl with ethylene is the main pathway at both 0.1 and 3.0 MPa, while the additional combination reactions: propargyl with allyl and cyclopentadienyl (c-C5H5) with CH3 become dominant at 0.1 MPa and 3.0 MPa, respectively. For the formation of larger aromatic naphthalene, the self-recombination of c-C5H5 is the most important channel at all investigated pressures.
