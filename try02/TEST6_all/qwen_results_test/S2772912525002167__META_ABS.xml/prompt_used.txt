You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling technologies for brominated flame-retardant plastics in e-waste With the fast-growing worldwide population and the large use of electronic gadgets, electronic waste (e-waste) plastics—which compose 25–30 % of total e-waste—have become rather common. Landfilled or burned non-biodegradable plastics include hazardous brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which pose hazards to human health and the environment. Thus, methods for sustainable recycling are rather crucial. This work is a comprehensive literature review based on an extensive search across a wide range of major databases and critical screening of the existing studies; no new laboratory experiments were performed. Investigated in this review work are novel methods for recycling e-waste plastics containing BFRs—including solvent extraction, hydrothermal treatment, supercritical CO₂ extraction, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, and catalytic pyrolysis— were reported in this literature. Of these methods, microwave-assisted pyrolysis has shown maximum performance in optimizing material recovery and breaking down BFRs. Across the reviewed studies, it was found that microwave facilitates selective breakdown, improves heating efficiency, and helps to gather important byproducts including hydrocarbons, metals, and bromine compounds, therefore enabling a more sustainable e-waste treatment system. Moreover, this review work offers a complete knowledge of the thermal degradation behaviour of significant BFRs, including hexabromocyclodecane (HBCD) isomers and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), so evaluating the efficacy of several removal procedures for these hazardous chemicals. Better knowledge of successful BFRs recycling helps researchers to build ecologically viable industrial applications and circular economy solutions. The results motivate resource recovery and minimize the environmental impact of electronic waste disposal, thereby guiding next research and development in e-waste plastic recycling.
