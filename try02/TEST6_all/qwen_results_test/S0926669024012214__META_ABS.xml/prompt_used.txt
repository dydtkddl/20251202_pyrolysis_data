You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potato peel carbon dots produced via fixed bed pyrolysis reactor decorated 1-D TiO2 nanorods for rapid removal of methylene blue, Cr (VI), Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus niger In this work, new type carbon quantum dots produced from waste of biomass were used as a dopant molecule in order to investigated photocatalytic properties of TiO2 nanorods structures. Low-cost and eco-friendly carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were obtained via slow pyrolysis of potato peels (PP) as a biomass waste without any chemicals by fixed bed pyrolysis. Potato peel quantum dots (P-CQDs) decorated TiO2 nanorods (P-CQDs/TNRs) were synthesized were by utilizing their high specific surface area, good dispersion, abundant surface functional groups. (P-CQDs) were imposed on the surface of the one-dimensional TiO2 nanorods fabricated via chemical impregnation method for P-CQDs/TiO2 nanorods (P-CQDs/TNRs) that TiO2 nanorods have been fabricated by hydrothermal route. Characteristic properties of as-prepared P-CQDs/TNRs photocatalysts were characterized employing TGA, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM/EDS, HRTEM, FTIR, fluorescence and UV–vis spectroscopy, resp. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared P-CQDs/TNRs were investigated for methylene blue, hexavalent chromium, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger under UV-A. The obtained results suggest that the photocatalytic activity of P-CQDs/TNRs composites was slightly enhanced as compared to that of TNRs. The scenario behind the superior photocatalytic activity of P-CQDs/TNRs may be having a synergetic effect between P-CQDs molecules and the surface of TNRs, and also the design of the charge-transfer channel of TNRs. Moreover, the carbon derived from a natural green source possesses the various functional groups such as CC, C-OH, C-O-C, CO, and when these functional groups deposited to the surface of the TiO2 nanorods, newly formed nanocomposites can improve the visible light-driven photocatalytic activity.
