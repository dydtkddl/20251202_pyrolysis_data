Potato peel carbon dots produced via fixed bed pyrolysis reactor decorated 1-D TiO2 nanorods for rapid removal of methylene blue, Cr (VI), Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus niger In this work, new type carbon quantum dots produced from waste of biomass were used as a dopant molecule in order to investigated photocatalytic properties of TiO2 nanorods structures. Low-cost and eco-friendly carbon quantum dots (CQDs) were obtained via slow pyrolysis of potato peels (PP) as a biomass waste without any chemicals by fixed bed pyrolysis. Potato peel quantum dots (P-CQDs) decorated TiO2 nanorods (P-CQDs/TNRs) were synthesized were by utilizing their high specific surface area, good dispersion, abundant surface functional groups. (P-CQDs) were imposed on the surface of the one-dimensional TiO2 nanorods fabricated via chemical impregnation method for P-CQDs/TiO2 nanorods (P-CQDs/TNRs) that TiO2 nanorods have been fabricated by hydrothermal route. Characteristic properties of as-prepared P-CQDs/TNRs photocatalysts were characterized employing TGA, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM/EDS, HRTEM, FTIR, fluorescence and UV–vis spectroscopy, resp. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared P-CQDs/TNRs were investigated for methylene blue, hexavalent chromium, Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger under UV-A. The obtained results suggest that the photocatalytic activity of P-CQDs/TNRs composites was slightly enhanced as compared to that of TNRs. The scenario behind the superior photocatalytic activity of P-CQDs/TNRs may be having a synergetic effect between P-CQDs molecules and the surface of TNRs, and also the design of the charge-transfer channel of TNRs. Moreover, the carbon derived from a natural green source possesses the various functional groups such as CC, C-OH, C-O-C, CO, and when these functional groups deposited to the surface of the TiO2 nanorods, newly formed nanocomposites can improve the visible light-driven photocatalytic activity.
