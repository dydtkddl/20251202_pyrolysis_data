You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High entropic engineering for sustainable energy and environmental applications High-entropy alloys (HEAs) came into existence as a revolutionary class of advanced materials distinguished by their exceptional catalytic performance, which results from unique thermodynamic stability, a wide range of elemental compositions, and highly tunable structural and electronic properties. The inherent high-entropy state of HEAs can be explained by four main effects: (i) high configurational entropy, which helps to stabilize a single-phase solid solution; (ii) sluggish atomic diffusion, which increases long-term structural stability; (iii) significant lattice distortion, which modifies the electronic environment and influences charge distribution; and (iv) the cocktail effect, which synergistically modifies the d-band center about the Fermi level, so optimizing catalytic activity. These distinct characteristics provide HEAs with many active sites and complex surface electronic structures, resulting in remarkably high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Although much research has already been done on the synthesis and practical application of HEA-based electrocatalysts, there is still a lack of thorough knowledge and a systematic approach to the rational design of these catalysts for energy and environmental technologies. This review commences by providing an in-depth understanding of the fundamental principles guiding the development of HEAs, in addition to the present state-of-the-art engineering approaches used for performance optimization and innovative synthetic approaches for their scale production. Then, an in-depth investigation of advanced characterization techniques offers significant critical insights into the structural and functional characteristics of these materials. Moreover, the study of the properties is driven by their multi-elemental composition and advanced applications of well-defined HEA nanostructures in the framework of environmental, energy, and storage technologies. Finally, this review concludes the prevailing challenges within the field and delineates prospective research directions to facilitate the transition of HEAs from fundamental studies to practical applications of energy and environmental technologies, thereby serving as a valuable resource for emerging and established researchers in this discipline.
