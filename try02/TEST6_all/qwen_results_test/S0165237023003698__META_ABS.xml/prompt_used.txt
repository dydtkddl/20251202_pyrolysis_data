You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic energy performance and byproducts of Ganoderma lucidum: Their multi-objective optimization Fossil fuels-related environmental issues, such as global climate change and soil and water acidification, are driving countries to develop biomass energy sources. As a second-generation biofuel with a significant spatiotemporal availability for global consumption, Ganoderma lucidum (GL) calls for the characterization and multi-objective optimization of its pyrolytic performance and byproducts. The GL pyrolysis was divided into three stages, with the main stage occurring between 205 and 630 °C. The activation energy for the main stage was estimated at 221.23 kJ/mol and 222.83 kJ/mol according to the FWO and KAS methods, respectively. The primary volatile products of the GL pyrolysis between 200 and 600 °C included H2O, CH4, CO2, CO, CO, C-O(H), CC, and NH3. The multi-objective optimization indicated that the GL pyrolysis between 650 and 750 oC jointly led to maximum energy yield and minimum gas emission. Biochar produced from GL (GLB) between 400 and 600 °C enhanced its aromaticity and stabilized the functional groups in the carbon structure. GLB obtained exhibited an increased number of porous structures and decreased aromaticity. These results provide a theoretical and practical basis for enhancing and volarizing the comprehensive circularity of GL biomass.
