Pyrolytic energy performance and byproducts of Ganoderma lucidum: Their multi-objective optimization Fossil fuels-related environmental issues, such as global climate change and soil and water acidification, are driving countries to develop biomass energy sources. As a second-generation biofuel with a significant spatiotemporal availability for global consumption, Ganoderma lucidum (GL) calls for the characterization and multi-objective optimization of its pyrolytic performance and byproducts. The GL pyrolysis was divided into three stages, with the main stage occurring between 205 and 630 °C. The activation energy for the main stage was estimated at 221.23 kJ/mol and 222.83 kJ/mol according to the FWO and KAS methods, respectively. The primary volatile products of the GL pyrolysis between 200 and 600 °C included H2O, CH4, CO2, CO, CO, C-O(H), CC, and NH3. The multi-objective optimization indicated that the GL pyrolysis between 650 and 750 oC jointly led to maximum energy yield and minimum gas emission. Biochar produced from GL (GLB) between 400 and 600 °C enhanced its aromaticity and stabilized the functional groups in the carbon structure. GLB obtained exhibited an increased number of porous structures and decreased aromaticity. These results provide a theoretical and practical basis for enhancing and volarizing the comprehensive circularity of GL biomass.
