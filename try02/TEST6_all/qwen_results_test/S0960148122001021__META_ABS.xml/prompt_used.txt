You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergetic effect between Pd clusters and oxygen vacancies in hierarchical Nb2O5 for lignin-derived phenol hydrodeoxygenation into benzene Lignin could be depolymerized into large amount of phenolic compounds via fast pyrolysis. The upgrade of phenolic compounds via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) involves multiple reaction pathways. It is challenging to selectively remove the oxygen-containing groups while keeping the aromatic rings intact. In this work, hierarchical Nb2O5 (H–Nb2O5) microspheres with abundant oxygen vacancies were synthesized to anchor the Pd clusters, which is featured with strong metal-support interaction via the electron transfer between Pd species and Nb species. For phenol HDO reaction, the oxygen vacancies were prone to interact with the phenolic hydroxy groups, resulting in phenol molecule adsorbed in a “nonplanar” manner, greatly weakening the CAr-O bonds and averting the ring hydrogenation. Besides, the activated hydrogen atoms on Pd clusters could migrate to the vicinity of oxygen vacancies via spillover, promoting the cleavage of CAr-O bond to obtain benzene. Current work provides a deep insight into the synergetic catalytic mechanism of Pd/H–Nb2O5 catalyst for phenol HDO reaction, and also sheds light on the design and synthesis of high-efficient catalysts in other heterogeneous catalysis fields.
