Review of catalyst materials in achieving the liquid hydrocarbon fuels from municipal mixed plastic waste (MMPW) Present study aims to highlight the recent developments and challenges associated with catalytic pyrolysis technology for converting municipal mixed plastic waste (MMPW) to valuable hydrocarbon fuels. The study identifies gaps between conventional-thermal and catalytic pyrolysis technologies. Catalyst plays major role in pyrolysis reactions that would reflect yield of liquid product. Scale-up of pyrolysis process with MMPW is viable if catalyst used in the current existing pyrolysis process. A wide scientific literature indicates that catalyst used in pyrolysis has seen changing faces from commercial catalyst to designing of catalyst to synthesis of cheaper catalyst. However, tailored catalyst found to be very effective in processing the waste to fuels. In addition, discussion extended on the yields of liquid hydrocarbon fuel variation with the use of different catalysts in thermal pyrolysis.
