You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly effective lead removal by novel alkaline biochar prepared by pyrolysis of woody biomass impregnated with low-level NaOH The remediation of heavy metal-contaminated environments, particularly those polluted with lead, remains a critical challenge due to the metal's toxicity and persistence. This study developed a novel alkaline biochar for enhanced lead adsorption, prepared from pine wood through low-level NaOH (0–2 wt%) dry impregnation followed by pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 350 to 600 °C. Characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) elucidated the alkaline biochar's surface modifications and adsorption mechanisms. Adsorption studies showed that 2 wt% NaOH-modified biochar (2 % NaOH-BC) achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 230 mg g⁻¹, representing a 14-fold improvement over non-alkaline treated biochar (0 % NaOH-BC, 16.1 mg g⁻¹). Kinetic studies confirmed chemisorption as the dominant mechanism, described by the pseudo-second-order model, while Langmuir isotherm analysis (R² = 0.933–0.970) indicated monolayer adsorption. XPS analysis revealed the emergence of Pb2+ peaks after adsorption, indicating successful Pb2+ uptake. The analysis provided insights into the adsorption mechanism, suggesting ion exchange and coordination interactions involving oxygen-containing functional groups. Electrostatic interactions also played a role, as increasing pH (3.0–11.0) enhanced Pb2+ binding due to surface deprotonation, with optimal adsorption at pH 11.0 (266 mg g⁻¹, 100 % efficiency). These findings highlight the potential of low-cost NaOH-treated biochar for effective and sustainable lead remediation.
