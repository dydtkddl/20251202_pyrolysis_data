You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of renewable mesitylene as jet-fuel additive: Reaction kinetics of acetone self-condensation over basic (TiO2) and acid (Al-MCM-41) catalysts Sustainable production of jet fuel additives plays an essential role to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation industry. Acetone obtained from biomass fermentation is one of the platform molecules of the bio-refinery that can be used as raw material of newly developed sustainable processes. Mesitylene jet fuel additive can be obtained by acetone self-condensation reaction catalyzed by porous solids. In the present work, TiO2 and Al-MCM-41 have been chosen, respectively, as basic and acid catalysts, because of having some tolerance to deactivation. The reaction was studied in a continuous fixed-bed reactor operated in the gas phase at space velocities of 7900 mol/kg h for TiO2 and 5000 mol/kg h for Al-MCM-41. The influence of feed concentration (5–20% acetone and 0–5% mesityl oxide) and temperature (200–350 °C) was studied. First, the reaction scheme was assessed based on the product distribution. It was found that the acid catalyst Al-MCM-41 favors mesityl oxide decomposition to undesired isobutylene and acetic acid. Then, a mechanistic kinetic model of the different steps of the reaction scheme was developed and fitted the experimental results of each catalyst. This model constitutes a valuable tool for the scale-up of this process.
