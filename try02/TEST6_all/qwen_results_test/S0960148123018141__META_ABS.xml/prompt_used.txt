You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-temperature high-pressure electrochemical hydrogenation of biocrude oil Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) occurs at high pressures (160–200 bar) and temperatures (300–350 °C), where the conditions in the reactor drive the conversion of wet biomass to biocrude oil (BC). Before drop-in, BC needs further upgrading (hydrogenation) to increase the energy content and decrease the concentration of heteroatoms. Normally this is done in hydrogenation reactors at high pressures and temperatures, which require an external high pressure H2 source. The main HTL by-product is process water (PW), which is either recirculated or cleaned before being disposed. Herein we investigated a membrane-less electrochemical method, which uses PW as hydrogen source and can be seamlessly integrated in HTL plants. We demonstrate a proof-of concept of a membrane-less electrochemical reactor that oxidizes PW at the anode and uses hydrogen in form of protons and electrons to hydrogenate BC at the cathode. We report BC upgrading (atomic H/C ratio increase up to 17 %) at high-pressure (up to 100 bar) and high-temperature (up to 200 °C), which mimic the conditions of an actual HTL plant. The proof-of-concept discussed here is a novel way of increasing the hydrogen content of biocrude oil within HTL reactor by using electricity, with no need of an external high-pressure H2 source.
