You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal characteristics and flame retardance behavior of phosphoric acid-containing poly(methacrylates) synthesized by RAFT polymerization The RAFT polymerization of strongly acidic, cross-linkable ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP) is described without protecting the acidic groups, with applications towards fire retardant polymers. After achieving the optimized polymerization conditions, we synthesized organo-soluble phosphoric acid-containing copolymers with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and bio-based isobornyl methacrylate (IBMA) with Mn in the range of 7.2−9.5 kg mol−1 and relatively low dispersities of 1.40−1.55. Additionally, we showed that it was possible to reinitiate RAFT polymerization from a P(EGMP)-rich macro-chain transfer agent with MMA and IBMA. DSC revealed Tg depression of copolymers as a function of EGMP concentration, which shows the plasticizing effect of EGMP. Rheology revealed cross-liking behavior of HEMAP-rich samples at 120 ℃. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed a one-step decomposition for PMMA and a two-step decomposition for PIBMA copolymers. In addition, the incorporation of 28 mol% EGMP slowed down the decomposition rate, improved the decomposition temperature (Td ) by 41 ℃, and notably increased the limiting oxygen index (LOI) from ∼17.6 to over 24. Among all samples, the EGMP-rich polymer (FEGMP = 0.71, FMMA = 0.29) exhibited prominent flame retardancy with the highest LOI value of 34. This result is invariably due to the strong acidity of phosphoric acid groups which notably leads to interesting flame retardancy properties.
