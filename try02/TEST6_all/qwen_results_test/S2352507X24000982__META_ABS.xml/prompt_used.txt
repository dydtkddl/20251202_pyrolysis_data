You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analyzing pyrolysis's effect on the environment and renewable potential of thermochemical plastic recycling This work uses cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles and purified plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) to create and evaluate nano fuel for four-stroke diesel engines. The objective is to increase engine performance and decrease emissions without altering the engine. PPO is mixed with conventional diesel fuel to form modified diesel fuel, which is then mixed with surfactant-modified CeO2 nanoparticles to produce a special nano fuel. HR-TEM, SEM, EDS, and XRD characterise the characteristics of the modified nanoparticles. A four-stroke diesel engine is used to test the nano fuel in order to assess emission characteristics and engine efficiency. Comparing the recommended procedure to commercial diesel fuel, the findings demonstrate a 16% reduction in pollutants and a 10% improvement in engine efficiency. This is because the oxygen in the nanoparticles makes the fuel purer and more viscous, which enhances burning efficiency. The performance and emission properties of the nano fuel are evaluated using a four-stroke diesel engine. The results show that, when compared to commercial diesel fuel, the suggested approach increases engine efficiency by 10% and decreases emissions by 16%. It also stresses employing nanoparticle additions to improve diesel engine performance without making substantial engine adjustments.
