You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on treatment technologies for printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW) The scarcity of clean and fresh water in some parts of the world, which is exacerbated by man’s activities either through domestic or industrial use, has been an age-old cause of worry. Printing and dyeing wastewater is the aqueous effluent released by factories that operate the dyeing and finishing of wool and silk, among other things. The printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW) contains a high concentration of dyes, salts, and other contaminants. This study is a review of published literature that utilised various technologies for the treatment of PDW. The studied technologies include adsorption, membrane technology, advanced oxidation processes, and biological processes. The strengths as well as the drawbacks of these technologies were studied. It was observed that adsorption, membrane technology, and biological processes recorded a removal efficiency of ˃80%, a rejection rate of ˃90%, and an effective dye degradation rate of ˃96%, respectively. From the study, it was observed that advanced oxidation processes is the most viable technique for PDW treatment due to its simplicity, efficiency, scalability, and from the economic point of view. Future perspectives, such as product recovery from the PDW waste stream, modelling and optimisation of the printing and dyeing processes, and the adoption of zero liquid and waste discharge, were also presented in this study. Finally, PDW treatment technologies should strike a balance between being environmentally friendly, efficient, and cost-effective to achieve robust and sustainable wastewater treatment programs.
