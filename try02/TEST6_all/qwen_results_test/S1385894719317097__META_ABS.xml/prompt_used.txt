You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of hollow activated carbon nanofibers (HACNFs) containing manganese oxide catalyst for toluene removal via two-step process of electrospinning and thermal treatment The development of an effective adsorbent for volatile organic compounds has been pursued in recent years, and diverse porous materials have been identified as promising candidates. However, most of the porous adsorbents have a limitation: the removal efficiency decreases at high temperatures. In this study, electrospun double-layer polymethyl methacrylate/manganese acetate (core), polyacrylonitrile (shell)-based nanofibers (NFs) are carbonized and CO2-activated to produce Mn3O4 nanoparticles embedded in hollow activated carbon NFs (Mn3O4/HACNFs). Owing to their hollow structure, the Mn3O4/HACNFs exhibit a great ability to adsorb toluene, with a longer breakthrough time of toluene adsorption than conventional activated carbon NFs. At 280 °C, the Mn3O4/HACNFs achieve catalytic oxidation of toluene (conversion to CO2 = 99% ± 0.5). Furthermore, when tested under alternating-temperature conditions (260 and 280 °C) for 4 h, the Mn3O4/HACNFs exhibit no degradation of the catalytic activity.
