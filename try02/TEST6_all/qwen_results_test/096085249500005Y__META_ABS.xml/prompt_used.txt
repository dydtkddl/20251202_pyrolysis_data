You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fractionation of residual lignocellulosics by dilute-acid prehydrolysis and alkaline extraction: Application to almond shells A two-stage process based on a hydrolytic pretreatment and an alkali extraction was applied to the fractionation of almond shells into cellulose, pentosan and lignin. Autohydrolysis and dilute-acid hydrolysis were studied as pretreatment methods in two different reactor configurations: an isothermal plug-flow reactor and a stirred, non-isothermal, batch autoclave. Yield and composition of the pulps resulting from the hydrolytic pretreatment were equivalent for both reactors when compared through the reaction severity concept. In this approach, pretreatment severity is quantified by R OH, a semi-empirical parameter that comprises the effect of temperature, time and acid concentration used during the pretreatment into a single reaction ordinate. Results showed that a pretreatment severity of log10 R OH=4.3 was the optimal to maximize pentosan recovery, with 66% of the potential yield. At this severity, lignin obtained was 64% of the potential yield and 9% of the initial cellulose was degraded. Viscosity average degree of polymerization of the α-cellulose remaining in the pulp was reduced to 500 at this severity. Lignin recovery increased with severity to a value of 82% at log10 R OH=4.7, allowing a better separation of the cellulose and the lignin, but also producing a higher depolymerization of the α-cellulose. Polydispersity of the α-cellulose also decreased with the severity increase, from 6.3 at log10 R OH=4.0 to a value of 3.4 at log10 R OH=4−7.
