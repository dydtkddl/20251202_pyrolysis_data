You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics of catalytic cracking with short contact times A novel isothermal pulse reactor was used to study the kinetics of gas oil cracking on a FCC equilibrium catalyst with short contact times. The feed was a lighter gas oil than typically used in FCC-units. Experiments were carried out by varying the catalyst-to-oil ratio, volume of the oil pulse, temperature and residence time. After each hydrocarbon pulse the catalyst was regenerated by introducing several oxygen/nitrogen pulses through the catalyst bed. The amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide formed were measured and the amount of coke on the catalyst was calculated. The reproducibility of the experiments was excellent. A kinetic model that included five lumps, namely, gas oil, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), dry gas and coke with five cracking reactions was developed first and its kinetic parameters were determined from the experimental results. The data could be best described by the model wherein the rate of cracking of gas oil to gasoline and to LPG were both approximated as second order dependency and the rate of cracking of gas oil to dry gas and to coke as first order dependency on the gas oil concentration. The five-lump model was further enlarged by dividing the gasoline fraction into paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics resulting in an eight-lump model with eight reactions. In addition, changes in the activity of the catalyst during one experiment was accounted for by using two exponential activity functions, one for catalytic cracking reactions and the other for coke formation. The formation of dry gas was considered to be the product of a thermal reaction only. The kinetic parameters of the Arrhenius’ law and the deactivation parameters were estimated by a non-linear regression program. In the five-lump model 12 parameters and in the eight-lump model 18 parameters (rate coefficients, activation energies and deactivation parameters) were obtained. The kinetic parameters of the Arrhenius’ law were statistically significant in both models.
