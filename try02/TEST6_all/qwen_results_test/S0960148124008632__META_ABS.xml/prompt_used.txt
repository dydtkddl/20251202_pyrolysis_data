You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reduction of inhibitory effect of lignin via degradation and improvement of anaerobic digestion performance of maize straw by oxidative pretreatment with Fe2+-activated persulfate The stable aromatic structure of lignin is one of the factors that limit the utilization of maize straw. In this study, pretreatment with Fe2+/persulfate (PS) was used to remove lignin while reducing the contents of lignin derivatives produced in the pretreatment. In comparison with the original straw, the lignin and hemicellulose contents of the pretreated straw were reduced to 54.58 % and 72.91 %, respectively. In the Fourier transform infrared spectrum, the characteristic peaks of both syringyl and guaiacyl units were significantly weaker after pretreatment with Fe2+/PS, which indicated that the pretreatment destroyed the structure of lignin. The pretreatment products were examined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and the results indicated that the present pretreatment method reduced the contents of soluble inhibitors produced from lignin. After pretreatment, only levulinic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, xylose, coumaric acid, and 4-coumaric acid were produce, whereas more than 20 soluble inhibitors are known to be produced from lignin. In anaerobic fermentation experiments, in comparison with the control group, the pretreated group exhibited higher gas production (an increase of 18.09 %) and a significantly higher methane content. This indicates that pretreatment with Fe2+/PS can improve the efficiency of the resource utilization of maize straw by degrading lignin.
