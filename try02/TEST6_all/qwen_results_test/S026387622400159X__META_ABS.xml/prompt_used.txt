You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolyzed coal base high surface area and mesoporous activated carbon for methyl violet 2B dye removal: Optimization of preparation conditions and adsorption key parameters Herein, a low-grade Malaysian coal namely Merit Karpit coal (MRTKC) was transformed into high surface area mesoporous activated carbon (MRTKC-AC) via pyrolysis-assisted ZnCl2 activation. A numerical optimization approach rooted in the Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed to determine the best operational conditions such as A: dosage of MRTKC-AC (ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 g/100 mL), B: the pH of the solution (varying from 4 to 10), and C: the contact time (ranging from 5 to 25 min). A notable surface area of 1229.1 m2/g and a distinctive mesoporous structure with an average pore diameter of 2.9 nm was achieved at optimum impregnation ratio (1 MRTKC: 2 ZnCl2), heating temperature 500 °C, and residence time 60 min. Moreover, the application of MRTKC-AC was evaluated through the removal of methyl violet (MV) from the aqueous environment. The comprehensive equilibrium and kinetic adsorption analyses showed that the adsorption of MV by MRTKC-AC matched closely to the Langmuir isotherm model, while the kinetic behavior was suitably described by the pseudo-second order model. Thus, the maximum adsorption capacity (q max) for MV dye onto MRTKC-AC was ascertained to be a substantial 238.6 mg/g. The MV dye adsorption mechanism onto MRTKC-AC surface indicates various dye–adsorbent interactions: electrostatic attraction, p–p interaction, and H-bonding. This work shows that Malaysian low-rank coal is an economical precursor for producing low-cost and efficient mesoporous activated carbon with substantive surface area.
