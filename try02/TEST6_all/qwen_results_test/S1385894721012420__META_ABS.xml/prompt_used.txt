You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cu-ZrO2 catalysts with highly dispersed Cu nanoclusters derived from ZrO2@ HKUST-1 composites for the enhanced CO2 hydrogenation to methanol In this study, a series of Cu-ZrO2 catalysts with highly dispersed Cu nanoclusters were prepared via the calcination and reduction of ZrO2@HKUST-1. These catalysts demonstrated an outstanding selectivity in the yield of methanol during CO2 hydrogenation. The space-time yield (STY) of methanol is 5.2 times higher than that of those similar catalysts reported by other researchers, which were prepared using conventional method and tested under the same conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) study revealed that the activation of CO2 occurs at the Cu-ZrO2 interfaces and facilitates the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. It is concluded that the controlled formation of highly dispersed Cu nanoclusters not only provides a large number of highly efficient active centers for CO2 hydrogenation, but also leads to the generation of more Cu-ZrO2 interfaces. These two effects contribute to the superior catalytic performance of the nano Cu-ZrO2 catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation.
