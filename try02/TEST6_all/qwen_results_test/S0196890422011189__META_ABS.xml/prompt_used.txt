You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of the behavior of Rosa rubiginosa seed waste during slow pyrolysis process towards complete recovery: Kinetic modeling and product analysis The aim of this work was to analyze the exhausted waste of sweet briar rosehip seeds (RSW) from an oil production industry in order to study its pyrolysis kinetics and the products obtained, for evaluation of its potential for thermochemical processes with the aim of achieving total recovery. Pyrolysis modeling by deconvolution showed the existence of four processes: one related to the loss of remaining moisture, and three pyrolysis reactions linked to the decomposition of hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin. Activation energy was 62.08 kJ/mol for physical evaporation, and 167.96 kJ/mol, 266.28 kJ/mol and 210.16 kJ/mol for the pyrolysis of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin, respectively. The kinetic model that best fit the experimental data was the reaction order with n between 3 and 4.8 for the pyrolysis reactions and n = 2.8 for moisture evaporation. Gases released were CO2, CO, CH4, H2, CH3OH, and water vapor. The highest production of CO2 and CO occurred at 300–350 °C, mainly due to the decomposition of hemicelluloses and cellulose, while the highest production of H2 and CH4 occurred from 350 to 400 °C onwards, mainly as a consequence of lignin decomposition. A total 59 compounds were identified in tar products by GC–MS, most of them phenolic by lignin rupture. SEM analysis of the biochar showed an increase in pore size and interstices on the surface with temperature. The SEM-EDS and XRD analysis of ashes showed high Ca content (53.02%), with Ca being present in compounds such as hydroxyapatite, portlandite, magnesian calcite and KCaPO4. The study demonstrated the potential of RSW for recovery through thermochemical methods, also revealing the decomposition kinetics in an inert atmosphere, which need to be known for designing pyrolysis, gasification or combustion power plants.
