You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fused Filament Fabrication of silicon carbide parts: A strategy for producing high-strength components Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a constant evolving additive manufacturing (AM) technology enabling the production of near-net-shape parts with complex geometries without requiring molds. While extensively applied to oxide ceramics such as alumina and zirconia, its application to non-oxide ceramics like silicon carbide (SiC) remains underexplored. Key challenges include defects arising from sintering operations and inherent porosity introduced by the 3D printing process. This original study examines the best strategy to produce fully dense and defect-free SiC through FFF method combined with pressureless sintering. Process parameters were systematically refined using Taguchi’s method. Defects like delaminations and voids were characterized and correlated with filament ageing. By employing optimized parameters, printed parts exhibited fine, homogeneous microstructures along with mechanical performances comparable to commercial SiC grades. The resulting properties include a density of 3.14 g.cm-³ , a hardness of 2492 HV, a Young’s modulus of 410 GPa, and an average flexural strength of 429 MPa with a Weibull’s modulus of 9.0. Furthermore, this contribution highlights the significant influence of filament ageing on mechanical performance, providing valuable insights for the development of reliable SiC components via FFF.
