You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treatment of PFAS-laden solids via fluidized bed gliding arc plasmatron The extensive use and recalcitrance of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have caused soil and water contamination across the globe. Most PFAS destruction technologies are applied to aqueous matrices; there is a need for technologies that can effectively treat PFAS-contaminated solids. In this study, a fluidized bed gliding arc (non-thermal) plasma reactor (FB-GAP) was used to treat PFAS-laden sand under different gas discharges. Argon plasma did not degrade PFAS, suggesting there is no dissociative electron attachment in dry gas. Similar parent compound degradation and defluorination extents were observed under air- and nitrogen-discharges, implying that thermolysis was the main PFAS degradation process. The use of methane as an auxiliary gas increased maximum temperatures and reduced treatment costs through plasma-assisted combustion of a lean fuel mix. The fluorine mass balance was ∼20 % after accounting for fluoride and targeted PFAS in treated solids and aqueous base traps for the effluent gas. The difference (∼80 %) likely resulted from irreversible reactions with SiO2 or formation of volatile organofluorine compounds. Further treatment of the effluent gas through the plasmatron is proposed as an alternative to fully mineralize PFAS. The results from this study demonstrate that non-equilibrium plasma technologies are a promising treatment option for PFAS-laden solids.
