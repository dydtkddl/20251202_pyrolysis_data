Recovery of synthetic copper ions by activated carbon from an industrial plastic PVC waste: Equilibrium, dynamic, kinetic and thermodynamic studies The recovery of Cu2+ ions by activated carbon obtained by an industrial polyvinyl chloride waste was examined. The raw material was treated chemically by KOH and activated carbon was obtained by pyrolysis at 700 °C. The textural surface properties of the adsorbent were characterized by XRD, SEM and FTIR. An adsorption experiments were conducted to assess the effect of pH, solid/liquid ratio, concentration and temperature on PVCW-AC removal effectiveness. Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the parameters. A removal percentage of 98 % and a maximum adsorption capacity of 145.63 mg/g were recorded. The adsorption followed pseudo-second order kinetic model.
