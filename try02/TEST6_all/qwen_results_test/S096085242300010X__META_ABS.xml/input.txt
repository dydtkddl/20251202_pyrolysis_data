Multi-objective operation optimization of spent coffee ground torrefaction for carbon–neutral biochar production Many energy-intensive processes are employed to enhance biomass fuel properties to overcome the difficulties in utilizing biomass as fuel. Therefore, energy conservation during these processes is crucial for realizing a circular bioeconomy. This study develops a newly devised method to evaluate SCG biochars’ higher heating value (HHV) and predict moisture content from power consumption. It is found that the increasing rates of HHV immediately follow decreases in power consumption, which could be used to determine the pretreatment time for energy conservation. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) maximizes SCG biochar’s HHV while minimizing energy consumption. The results show that producing SCG biochar with 23.98 MJ∙kg−1 HHV requires 20.042 MJ∙kg−1, using a torrefaction temperature of 244 °C and torrefaction time of 27 min and 43 sec. Every kilogram of biochar with an energy yield of 85.93 % is estimated to cost NT$ 12.21.
