Micro-reactors for nanomaterial synthesis: Manufacturing techniques, current applications and future prospects Precise control over the size, morphology, and crystal structure of nanomaterials is a fundamental prerequisite for their functional applications. Traditional batch synthesis methods, however, struggle to meet the demands for high-performance nanomaterial production due to inefficient mass and heat transfer, coupled with significant fluctuations in reaction parameters. Micro-reactors, as continuous-flow devices with characteristic dimensions ranging from micrometres to millimetres, offer a critical technological pathway to overcome these limitations. Their advantages include high specific surface area (>10,000 m2/m3), excellent heat transfer coefficients (up to 10,000 W/(m2·K)), and millisecond-scale mixing capabilities. This paper systematically reviews research progress in micro-reactor-based nanomaterial synthesis: at the manufacturing technology level, traditional photolithography and precision machining enable high-precision moulding (channel deviation 90 %). Concurrently, this work dissects core challenges including multiphase flow regulation, channel blockage, and amplification effects, proposing solutions such as ultrasonic enhancement, modular amplification, and digital twin optimisation. It further envisions future directions encompassing intelligent regulation, multi-field coupling, and green manufacturing. This paper provides crucial guidance for advancing nanomaterials from laboratory R&D to industrial-scale high-quality production via microreactors, offering significant implications for overcoming bottlenecks in high-end nanomaterial synthesis.
