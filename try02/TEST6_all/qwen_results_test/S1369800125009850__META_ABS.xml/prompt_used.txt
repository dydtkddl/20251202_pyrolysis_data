You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Micro-reactors for nanomaterial synthesis: Manufacturing techniques, current applications and future prospects Precise control over the size, morphology, and crystal structure of nanomaterials is a fundamental prerequisite for their functional applications. Traditional batch synthesis methods, however, struggle to meet the demands for high-performance nanomaterial production due to inefficient mass and heat transfer, coupled with significant fluctuations in reaction parameters. Micro-reactors, as continuous-flow devices with characteristic dimensions ranging from micrometres to millimetres, offer a critical technological pathway to overcome these limitations. Their advantages include high specific surface area (>10,000 m2/m3), excellent heat transfer coefficients (up to 10,000 W/(m2·K)), and millisecond-scale mixing capabilities. This paper systematically reviews research progress in micro-reactor-based nanomaterial synthesis: at the manufacturing technology level, traditional photolithography and precision machining enable high-precision moulding (channel deviation 90 %). Concurrently, this work dissects core challenges including multiphase flow regulation, channel blockage, and amplification effects, proposing solutions such as ultrasonic enhancement, modular amplification, and digital twin optimisation. It further envisions future directions encompassing intelligent regulation, multi-field coupling, and green manufacturing. This paper provides crucial guidance for advancing nanomaterials from laboratory R&D to industrial-scale high-quality production via microreactors, offering significant implications for overcoming bottlenecks in high-end nanomaterial synthesis.
