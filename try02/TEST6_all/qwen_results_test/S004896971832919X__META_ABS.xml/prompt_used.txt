You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Activated bio-chars derived from rice husk via one- and two-step KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis for phenol adsorption The activated bio-chars (AB) were successfully synthesized from rice husk by one- and two-step KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis. The two-step pyrolysis can produce the high yields of AB compared to the one-step pyrolysis. Moreover, the yield of AB decreased with the increase of the mass ratio of KOH and char, which had a significant effect on the development of the surface area and porosity of carbon. In particular, the AB derived from the two-step pyrolysis at 750°C (mass ratio of KOH and char was 3) had the highest specific surface area (SBET =2138m2/g) with many micro-porous structures, which was favored for the phenol adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of AB2-3-750 reached 201mg/g because of its excellent surface porosity property. The phenol can be efficiently removed from water by only several minutes. The Langmuir model defined well the adsorption isotherm with a high correlation coefficient value, indicating a monolayer adsorption behavior. And the adsorption process defined well with the pseudo-second-order model. The phenol molecules passed into the internal surface via the liquid-film controlled diffusion, so the behavior of phenol adsorption onto the AB was predominantly controlled via the chemisorption. Furthermore, the functional groups on the outer surfaces of AB can attract the phenol molecules onto the internal surfaces via “π-π dispersion interaction” and “donor-acceptor effect”.
