Activated bio-chars derived from rice husk via one- and two-step KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis for phenol adsorption The activated bio-chars (AB) were successfully synthesized from rice husk by one- and two-step KOH-catalyzed pyrolysis. The two-step pyrolysis can produce the high yields of AB compared to the one-step pyrolysis. Moreover, the yield of AB decreased with the increase of the mass ratio of KOH and char, which had a significant effect on the development of the surface area and porosity of carbon. In particular, the AB derived from the two-step pyrolysis at 750°C (mass ratio of KOH and char was 3) had the highest specific surface area (SBET =2138m2/g) with many micro-porous structures, which was favored for the phenol adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of AB2-3-750 reached 201mg/g because of its excellent surface porosity property. The phenol can be efficiently removed from water by only several minutes. The Langmuir model defined well the adsorption isotherm with a high correlation coefficient value, indicating a monolayer adsorption behavior. And the adsorption process defined well with the pseudo-second-order model. The phenol molecules passed into the internal surface via the liquid-film controlled diffusion, so the behavior of phenol adsorption onto the AB was predominantly controlled via the chemisorption. Furthermore, the functional groups on the outer surfaces of AB can attract the phenol molecules onto the internal surfaces via “π-π dispersion interaction” and “donor-acceptor effect”.
