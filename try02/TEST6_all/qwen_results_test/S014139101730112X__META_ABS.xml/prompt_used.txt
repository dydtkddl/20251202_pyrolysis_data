You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Depolymerization kinetics for thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer degradation in subcritical methanol The depolymerisation kinetics of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) in subcritical methanol was investigated. The molecular weight distributions (MWDs) of the samples were measured with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and analysed through Origin 8.5 peak fit module, and continuous distribution kinetics was employed to describe the degradation procedure. Experimental and modelling results indicated that the degradation procedure was two stage owing to the existence of weak linkages between soft and hard domains. During degradation, weak linkages primarily completed the fracture, and strong linkages underwent scission throughout the process. The fracture of TPU chain involved random and chain-end scissions. With continuous distribution kinetics, random scission was divided into two stages by the time when weak linkages were totally disrupted. The activation energies in stages 1 and 2 were 181 and 241 kJ/mol. Chain-end scission was only related to strong linkages. The activation energies of the three kinds of monomers---4,4′-methylene diphenyl carbamate (MDC), 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and dimethyl adipate (DMA) were 137.0, 122.5 and 224.9 kJ/mol, respectively.
