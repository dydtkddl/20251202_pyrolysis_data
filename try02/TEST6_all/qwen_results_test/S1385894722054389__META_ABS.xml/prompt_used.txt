You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel strategy for rapid identification of pyrolytic synergy and prediction of product yield: Insight into co-pyrolysis of xylan and polyethylene The distributions of biomass and plastic co-pyrolysis products are complicated by abundant component combinations, pyrolysis conditions, and synergies. Herein, the hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to rapidly determine synergies and predict product yields of xylan and polyethylene (PE) co-pyrolysis at 500–700 °C. The results showed that co-pyrolysis promoted liquid production and suppressed solid and char formation. Pyrolytic interactions improved the decomposition of the PE-derived wax, resulting in 1.5–1.9- and 1.7–2.1-fold higher yields of heavy gas oil and C≥26 hydrocarbons compared to the theoretical values. HCA classified pyrolyzates with similar synergy into the same cluster, which reflected the suppressed carbonyl compound production, enhanced furfural and phenols yields at 700 °C, and greater C17–C30 hydrocarbon production. The quadratic model of RSM predicted the yields of gas, CO, C3Hn, C4Hn, liquid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, hydrocarbon oil, gasoline, solid, and char influenced by synergies. Owing to complex interactions, the cubic model fitted the CH4 and C2H4 yields. The linear model described the CO2 yield without synergy. This work illustrates the utility of combining RSM and HCA to predict product distributions of various waste co-treatment processes.
