You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of solid wastes (low-density polyethylene and lignocellulosic biomass) over microwave assisted biochar for bio-oil upgrading and hydrogen production Metal catalysts are unavoidable within the process of catalytic pyrolysis, a part of hydrogen production; as a result, the reuse and disposal of these materials are problems that need to be solved. Biochar, with its extensive sources, large specific area, and developed pores, has the potential to be developed in this catalytic area. In this study, we used microwave-assisted corn stover biochar as a catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of Douglas Fir (DF) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in order to investigate its catalytic effects. The results showed that the biochar significantly increased the selectivity of hydrogen (H2) in the syngas, and the highest selectivity that could be achieved was 72 vol% at 650 °C, with a biochar (BC)/feedstock ratio of 4. Furthermore, the application of biochar decreased the wax yield and contributed to the good selectivity of aromatics. The biochar developed in this study was also proven to show good reusability, as even after 10 times of reuses, the biochar still achieved a yield of H2 over 50 vol%.
