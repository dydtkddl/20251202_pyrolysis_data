Study on Gas Products Distributions During Fast Co-pyrolysis of Paulownia Wood and PET at High Temperature The fast co-pyrolysis behavior of Paulownia wood (PAW) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was studied via a drop tube fixed-bed reactor under nitrogen atmosphere at temperature ranged from 600oC to 1000oC. The discrepancy between experimental and predicted values was presented to investigate the synergistic effects during PAW and PET co-pyrolytic process. The gas yields of all tested blends were increased as the increment of temperature. With PAW ratio in the blends increased, the gas yields were elevated. However, the experimental values of gas yields of the blends were lower than predicted ones indicating that gas products yields were inhibited during co-pyrolysis. The evolution of the gas components containing H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and a small quantity of light hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6) was investigated at different blending ratios and temperatures.
