Exploring nanomaterial-modified biochar for environmental remediation applications Environmental pollution, particularly from heavy metals and toxic elements, poses a significant threat to both human health and ecological systems. While various remediation technologies exist, there is an urgent need for cost-effective and sustainable solutions. Biochar, a carbon-rich product derived from the pyrolysis of organic matter, has emerged as a promising material for environmental remediation. However, its pristine form has limitations, such as low adsorption capacities, a relatively narrow range of pH adaptability which can limit its effectiveness in diverse environmental conditions, and a tendency to lose adsorption capacity rapidly in the presence of competing ions or organic matters. This review aims to explore the burgeoning field of nanomaterial-modified biochar, which seeks to overcome the limitations of pristine biochar. By incorporating nanomaterials, the adsorptive and reactive properties of biochar can be significantly enhanced. Such modifications, especially biochar supported with metal nanoparticles (biochar-MNPs), have shown promise in various applications, including the removal of heavy metals, organic contaminants, and other inorganic pollutants from aqueous environments, soil, and air. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis techniques, characterization methods, and applications of biochar-MNPs, as well as discusses their underlying mechanisms for contaminant removal. It also offers insights into the advantages and challenges of using nanomaterial-modified biochar for environmental remediation and suggests directions for future research.
