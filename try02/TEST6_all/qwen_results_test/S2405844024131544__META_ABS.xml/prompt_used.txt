You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring nanomaterial-modified biochar for environmental remediation applications Environmental pollution, particularly from heavy metals and toxic elements, poses a significant threat to both human health and ecological systems. While various remediation technologies exist, there is an urgent need for cost-effective and sustainable solutions. Biochar, a carbon-rich product derived from the pyrolysis of organic matter, has emerged as a promising material for environmental remediation. However, its pristine form has limitations, such as low adsorption capacities, a relatively narrow range of pH adaptability which can limit its effectiveness in diverse environmental conditions, and a tendency to lose adsorption capacity rapidly in the presence of competing ions or organic matters. This review aims to explore the burgeoning field of nanomaterial-modified biochar, which seeks to overcome the limitations of pristine biochar. By incorporating nanomaterials, the adsorptive and reactive properties of biochar can be significantly enhanced. Such modifications, especially biochar supported with metal nanoparticles (biochar-MNPs), have shown promise in various applications, including the removal of heavy metals, organic contaminants, and other inorganic pollutants from aqueous environments, soil, and air. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis techniques, characterization methods, and applications of biochar-MNPs, as well as discusses their underlying mechanisms for contaminant removal. It also offers insights into the advantages and challenges of using nanomaterial-modified biochar for environmental remediation and suggests directions for future research.
