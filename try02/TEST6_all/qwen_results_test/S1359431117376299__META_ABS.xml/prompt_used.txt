You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of the co-pyrolysis of rubber residual and HDPE waste using the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) The kinetic analysis for rubber residual i.e. rubber seed shell, high density polyethylene (HDPE) waste and its mixture are investigated using distributed activation energy model (DAEM) reaction model. Furthermore, the pyrolysis characteristics from these materials are investigated by non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis from temperature 323 K to 1173 K at varying heating rates range of 10–200 K/min in inert argon atmosphere. The average value determined for activation energy, E a and pre-exponential factor, k 0 are 54.888 kJ mol−1 and 6.923 × 104 s−1 respectively for RSS, 75.396 kJ mol−1 and 1.346 × 106 s−1 respectively for HDPE and 64.010 kJ mol−1 and 8.444 × 104 s−1 respectively for binary mixture of RSS/HDPE. By taking these values as the initial guess for Gaussian distribution, and assuming the standard deviation, σ is at 15 kJ mol−1, as well as constant k 0 value for all first order reactions, the mean activation energy, E 0 determined from the distribution curve for RSS, HDPE and RSS/HDPE are 55.0 kJ mol−1, 75.5 kJ mol−1 and 64.0 kJ mol−1 respectively. The values of E 0 and k 0 in pyrolysis of binary mixture of RSS/HDPE are found to be lower compared to the individual component of RSS and HDPE in pyrolysis process.
