You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of boric acid on thermal dehydrogenation of ammonia borane: Mechanistic studies Ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) is a promising hydrogen storage material for use in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell applications. In this study, the effect of boric acid on AB dehydrogenation was investigated. Our study shows that boric acid is a promising additive to decrease onset temperature as well as to enhance hydrogen release kinetics for AB thermolysis. With heating, boric acid forms tetrahydroxyborate ion along with some water released from boric acid itself. It is believed that this ion serves as Lewis acid which catalyzes AB dehydrogenation. Using boric acid, we obtained high H2 yield (11.5 wt% overall H2 yield, 2.23 H2 equivalent) at 85 °C, PEM fuel cell operating temperatures, along with rapid kinetics. In addition, only trace amount of NH3 (20–30 ppm) was detected in the gaseous product. The spent AB solid product was found to be polyborazylene-like species. The results suggest that the addition of boric acid to AB is promising for hydrogen storage, and could be used in PEM fuel cell based vehicles.
