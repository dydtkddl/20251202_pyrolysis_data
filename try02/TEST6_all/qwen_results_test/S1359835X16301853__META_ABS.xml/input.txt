Enhanced thermal-conductive and anti-dripping properties of polyamide composites by 3D graphene structures at low filler content In this work, 3D graphene structures constructed by graphene foam (GF) were introduced into polyamide-6 (PA6) matrix for the purpose of enhancing the thermal-conductive and anti-dripping properties of PA6 composites. The GF were prepared by one-step hydrothermal method. The PA6 composites were synthesized by in-situ thermal polycondensation method to realize PA6 chains covalently grafted onto the graphene sheets. The 3D interconnected graphene structure favored the formation of the consecutive thermal conductive paths or networks even at relatively low graphene loadings. As a result, the thermal conductivity was improved by 300% to 0.847W·m−1·K−1 of PA6 composites at 2.0wt% graphene loading from 0.210W·m−1·K−1 of pure PA6 matrix. The presence of self-supported 3D structure alone with the covalently-grafted PA6 chains endowed the PA6 composites good anti-dripping properties.
