You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic performance of cerium modified Silicalite-1 molecular sieves in the conversion of methanol to propene A series of cerium modified Silicalite-1 molecular sieves were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and used as the catalysts in the conversion of methanol to propene (MTP). The cerium modified Silicalite-1 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 sorption, pyridine adsorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD); their catalytic performance in MTP was evaluated in a continuous flow fixed-bed micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure and 450°C, with a methanol weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 9.6 h−1. The results showed that Silicalite-1 exhibits superior catalytic performance in MTP in terms of catalytic stability and selectivity to propene, in comparison with the HZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 200. The introduction of Ce can effectively adjust the acid properties and pore structure of Silicalite-1; modification with an appropriate concentration of Ce can reduce the amount of strong acid sites and then enhance the catalytic performance of Silicalite-1 in MTP. Over the cerium modified Silicalite-1 with a CeO2 content of 5.0%, the selectivity to propene is increased from 31.9% to 38.2% and the catalytic lifetime is extended from 51 to 72 h, in comparison with those over the parent Silicalite-1.
