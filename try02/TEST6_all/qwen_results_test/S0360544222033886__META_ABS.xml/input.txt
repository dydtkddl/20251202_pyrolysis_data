Recent advances in urban green energy development towards carbon emissions neutrality Climate change is a significant long-term threat faced by humanity today. The urban energy transformation from a carbon-emissions-intensive environment to a carbon-emissions-free solution is vital to achieving carbon emissions neutrality. Future city planning shall include the carbon emissions neutrality concept for sustainable urban green energy development. This review covers the recent advances in green energy development in urban sectors, including thermal process and power systems in the industry, building and urban environment, transportation, and waste treatment. It includes the compendium of the recent publications reported in the Virtual Special Issue of ENERGY presented at the 5th International Conference of Modern Power Systems and Units (MPSU′21) and the 7th International Conference on Low Carbon Asia and Beyond (ICLCA′21). Recent research highlights the need to develop novel energy materials, increase the storage capacity and durability of battery cells, reduce the vulnerability of renewable energy sources, enhance the applicability of optimisation modelling, and improve new energy research and engineering design. This review also summarises the challenges and recommendations for green urban energy development in environmental, economic, and societal aspects to achieve carbon emissions neutrality. Innovative measures to minimise energy consumption for waste treatments are also recommended. Innovations in technology with strong institutional regulations and incentives support and behavioural change in social norms are needed for achieving carbon emissions neutrality in an urban environment.
