You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The overlooked pathway: A systematic review on sewage sludge treatment as a critical secondary source of terrestrial micro(nano)plastics Sewage sludge has long been believed as an essential sink for microplastics (MPs), with concentrations up to 1380 particles/kg dry weight. Considering that MP residues in present sewage sludge are predominantly aged, their surface characteristics have been modified, with specific surface area ranging from 1 m2/g to 5 m2/g and a carbonyl index increasing from 0.2 to 1.8, which corresponds to greater toxic effects. Nevertheless, the formation mechanisms and potential ecological risks of those aged MPs to sludge ecology have yet to be unraveled. This paper provides an overview of the effect of sludge treatment processes (e.g., mechanical pressing, sludge dry/wet heat oxidation, anaerobic digestion, composting) on the plastic fragmentation and MPs formation based on the existing techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Temperature-catalyzed heat oxidation in physically, microbial-dominated biodegradation, and reactive oxygen species (hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions)-mediated chemical oxidation are preliminary contributors to MP weathering, and able to induce up to 76 % reduction in plastic number and 97 % reduction in plastic molecular mass. Moreover, adverse environmental threats of aged MPs to the ecology of sewage treatment plants via the release of toxic oligomers to surrounding sludge; shifting the sludge microbial community structure; and altering the sludge function were also summarized herein. Overall, the obtained results elucidate formation pathways and environmental fate of sludge-based MP (pristine/aged variants), establishing a scientific basis for ecological risk assessment and predicting their cross-media migration.
