You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of phenol adsorption performance and mechanism using Na2EDTA-modified activated biochars produced from a fluidized bed pyrolysis system The study investigated the characteristics and mechanisms of phenol adsorption in three types of modified activated biochars (rice straw, rice husk, and sawdust) obtained through fluidized bed pyrolysis system, particularly focusing on biochars activated with KOH and modified with Na2EDTA. The experimental comprehensively analyzed the morphology of biochars through nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), while employed mathematical descriptions with isotherm, adsorption kinetics, and thermodynamics models. The adsorption process could be better described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the spontaneous and exothermic reaction. After being activated by KOH, results showed that KOH could generate potassium vapor for etching carbon layers at high temperatures, forming a microporous structure. With the KOH activation and Na2EDTA modification, the amino (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups were effectively loaded on the adsorbents. Especially, after Na2EDTA modification, an N1s peak appeared in the XPS spectrum, the peak area ratios of pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N drop from 54.20 % to 21.45%–49.15% and 16.62%, while that of pyridinic-N and nitrogen oxides correspondingly increased, indicating the presence and alteration of nitrogen-containing functional groups, promoting the formation of π-π bonds, and strengthening of π-π dispersion effects. Meanwhile, the specific surface area reaches 1143.60 m2/g to 1337.20 m2/g, the maximum adsorption capacities reach 156.29 mg/g to 195.17 mg/g, which outperform the commercial activated biochars. This finding suggests that Na2EDTA -modified biochars by fluidized bed could enhance the adsorption capacity for phenol, and offer economic feasibility and high production technical for the environmental protection and wastewater treatment.
