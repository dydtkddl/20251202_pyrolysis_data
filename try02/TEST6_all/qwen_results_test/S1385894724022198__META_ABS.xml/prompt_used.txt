You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from microwave co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate and low-density polyethylene using coconut husk carbon as microwave absorbent The application of biochar as microwave absorbers in microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) has been widely studied. It has been reported that coconut husk carbon (CHC) showed good process characteristics and product distribution as microwave absorbers. However, the existing studies did not pay much attention to the reusability of CHC absorbers. In this study, the CHC absorbers prepared from agricultural and forestry wastes were reused in multiple cycles in the MACFP of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Compared with typical microwave absorbers such as spherical silicon carbide (SiC) and granular activated carbon (GAC), CHC demonstrated favorable process characteristics with relatively high heating rate (29 °C/min) and short heating time (within 12 min). In terms of product properties, the highest liquid yield of 51.67 wt% and the highest content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) of 82.82 % were obtained at the appropriate pyrolysis temperature (550 °C). After five consecutive uses, the CHC bed still produced comparable heating profiles and product distributions, compared to that of SiC. At the same time, a positive synergistic effect between PET and LDPE was observed. The co-feeding of PET and LDPE (50L50P) appropriately increased the liquid yield (42.50 wt% vs 38.75 wt%) and the relative content of MAHs (77.11 % vs 72.96 %) in comparison to their theoretical value. Finally, this study supplies a new strategy for utilizing recycled CHC as a microwave absorber for the treatment of hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-deficient mixed plastic wastes to produce MAHs products, which also reduces waste and realizes energy conversion.
