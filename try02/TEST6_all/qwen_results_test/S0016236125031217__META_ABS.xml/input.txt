Preparation of K2CO3/γ-Al2O3 adsorbents for CO2 capture by spray fluidization impregnation granulation method The reaction between K2CO3 and CO2 enables CO2 capture at low temperature conditions. The industrial application of this technology urgently requires the scalable preparation of solid adsorbents. In this study, the K2CO3-based adsorbents were prepared by the spray fluidization impregnation granulation method, a scalable method for preparing adsorbents with porous γ-Al2O3 as the carrier and K2CO3 as the active component. The effects of the pore size (∼2.2 nm, ∼4 nm, ∼10 nm, ∼18 nm) and particle size (0.7 mm and 1.0 mm) of the carriers were investigated. The carrier with a pore size of 18 nm maintained a well-developed microstructure and porosity after loading K2CO3, and K2CO3 can be uniformly impregnated into the interior of the carrier. As the pore size of the carrier increased, the uniformity of K2CO3 loading was improved. Under the same pore size, smaller particle sizes resulted in a denser particle surface. Fixed-bed adsorption and regeneration experiments indicated that the CO2 adsorption capacity is generally higher for the adsorbents using carriers with larger pores and surface area. By comprehensively evaluating the microstructures, adsorption performance, and mechanical properties of different adsorbents, the adsorbent with a pore size of 18 nm and a particle size of 1.0 mm was selected as the optimized one, and its CO2 adsorption capacity remained 2.46 mmol/g after 10 cycles of adsorption-regeneration reactions.
