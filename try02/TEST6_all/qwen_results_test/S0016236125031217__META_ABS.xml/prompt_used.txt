You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of K2CO3/γ-Al2O3 adsorbents for CO2 capture by spray fluidization impregnation granulation method The reaction between K2CO3 and CO2 enables CO2 capture at low temperature conditions. The industrial application of this technology urgently requires the scalable preparation of solid adsorbents. In this study, the K2CO3-based adsorbents were prepared by the spray fluidization impregnation granulation method, a scalable method for preparing adsorbents with porous γ-Al2O3 as the carrier and K2CO3 as the active component. The effects of the pore size (∼2.2 nm, ∼4 nm, ∼10 nm, ∼18 nm) and particle size (0.7 mm and 1.0 mm) of the carriers were investigated. The carrier with a pore size of 18 nm maintained a well-developed microstructure and porosity after loading K2CO3, and K2CO3 can be uniformly impregnated into the interior of the carrier. As the pore size of the carrier increased, the uniformity of K2CO3 loading was improved. Under the same pore size, smaller particle sizes resulted in a denser particle surface. Fixed-bed adsorption and regeneration experiments indicated that the CO2 adsorption capacity is generally higher for the adsorbents using carriers with larger pores and surface area. By comprehensively evaluating the microstructures, adsorption performance, and mechanical properties of different adsorbents, the adsorbent with a pore size of 18 nm and a particle size of 1.0 mm was selected as the optimized one, and its CO2 adsorption capacity remained 2.46 mmol/g after 10 cycles of adsorption-regeneration reactions.
