You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient production of hydrogen-rich syngas by pyrolysis coupled with catalytic steam reforming of degradable polylactic acid waste plastics over high-entropy oxide catalyst To mitigate the solid waste crisis, converting waste plastics into valuable products through thermochemical processes, such as through pyrolysis, is emerging. Polylactic acid (PLA) plastics are difficult to separate from other plastics in solid waste, and mixed waste is usually directly landfilled or incinerated. Moreover, studies focused solely on the pyrolysis of PLA plastic remain relatively scarce. The large amount of tar produced during plastic pyrolysis can reduce the high-value production of hydrogen, and high-entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst exhibit excellent performance in tar conversion and anti-carbon deposition. In this research, HEO catalyst was synthesized by the sol-gel method for the pyrolysis of waste PLA plastic volatiles, aiming to generate H2-rich syngas in a two-stage integrated reactor system. During catalytic reforming, the highest hydrogen production was 124.1 mmol∙gPLA −1, and the gas yield based on plastic mass reached 259.8 wt%. The superiority of HEO catalyst stems from the synergistic interaction of various elements, enhancing the structural stability of the high-entropy system and increasing oxygen vacancies, resulting in strong C–C and C–H bond-breaking capabilities in the Ce, Mg, Fe, Co, and Ni HEO catalyst. In addition, this study investigated the mechanism of PLA’s simple pyrolysis and the role of the HEO catalyst in the catalytic steam reforming of PLA. This study developed a novel high-entropy aluminate catalyst demonstrating efficient hydrogen-rich syngas production, providing an innovative approach for generating hydrogen-rich syngas from high-molecular-weight polymer plastics through pyrolysis coupled with catalytic steam reforming.
