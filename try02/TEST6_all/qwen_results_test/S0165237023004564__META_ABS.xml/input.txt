Application of persulfate-assisted graphitic carbon, derived through pyrolysis of waste biomass, driven by visible light, for the removal of tetracycline from water: Mechanisms and performance influencing parameters Sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process by using carbon-based materials has attracted widespread attention for removal of emerging contaminants in water. This paper reports the study on the efficacy of visible light activated persulfate (PS) – graphitic carbon (GC) system for the removal of tetracycline (TC) from water . Here GCs from residual agricultural biomass were synthesized via a facile and chemical-free pyrolysis route, and their characteristics were analyzed under varying thermal conditions, viz. temperature (550–950 °C) and heating rate (2.5–10 °C min−1). The GCs at high pyrolysis temperatures (> 700 °C) revealed graphitic and condensed aromatic carbon networks with enhanced textural properties, facilitating electron-mediated reactions through interconnected morphology. The methodology is derived from the research that shows certain pyrolysis derived carbon products are known to have transient photocurrent response, indicating semiconductor properties. Here, the visible light-driven GC/PS (950 °C, 5 °C min−1) system resulted in high TC removal efficiency of 91.23% within 180 min compared to other PS/GCs prepred under different conditions. The mass spectroscopy data shows that the GC/PS system successfully degraded TC into simpler products and achieved the highest mineralization efficiency of about 65.43 ± 3.62%. The radical scavenging experiments revealed that 1O2 and •OH were the dominant reactive oxygen species suppressing degradation of TC by 13% and 9%, respectively. It can be surmised that both radical and non-radical pathways facilitate TC degradation via dehydration, demethylation and oxidation of aromatic rings- due to both catalytic and physico-chemical properties of GC/PS .
