You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of persulfate-assisted graphitic carbon, derived through pyrolysis of waste biomass, driven by visible light, for the removal of tetracycline from water: Mechanisms and performance influencing parameters Sulfate radical based advanced oxidation process by using carbon-based materials has attracted widespread attention for removal of emerging contaminants in water. This paper reports the study on the efficacy of visible light activated persulfate (PS) – graphitic carbon (GC) system for the removal of tetracycline (TC) from water . Here GCs from residual agricultural biomass were synthesized via a facile and chemical-free pyrolysis route, and their characteristics were analyzed under varying thermal conditions, viz. temperature (550–950 °C) and heating rate (2.5–10 °C min−1). The GCs at high pyrolysis temperatures (> 700 °C) revealed graphitic and condensed aromatic carbon networks with enhanced textural properties, facilitating electron-mediated reactions through interconnected morphology. The methodology is derived from the research that shows certain pyrolysis derived carbon products are known to have transient photocurrent response, indicating semiconductor properties. Here, the visible light-driven GC/PS (950 °C, 5 °C min−1) system resulted in high TC removal efficiency of 91.23% within 180 min compared to other PS/GCs prepred under different conditions. The mass spectroscopy data shows that the GC/PS system successfully degraded TC into simpler products and achieved the highest mineralization efficiency of about 65.43 ± 3.62%. The radical scavenging experiments revealed that 1O2 and •OH were the dominant reactive oxygen species suppressing degradation of TC by 13% and 9%, respectively. It can be surmised that both radical and non-radical pathways facilitate TC degradation via dehydration, demethylation and oxidation of aromatic rings- due to both catalytic and physico-chemical properties of GC/PS .
