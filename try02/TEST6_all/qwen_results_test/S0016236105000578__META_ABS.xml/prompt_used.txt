You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of biomass in the presence of Al-MCM-41 type catalysts Al-MCM-41 type mesoporous catalysts were used for converting the pyrolysis vapours of spruce wood in order to obtain better bio-oil properties. Four Al-MCM-41 type catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 20 were tested. The catalytic properties of Al-MCM-41 catalyst were modified by pore enlargement that allows the processing of larger molecules and by introduction of Cu cations into the structure. Spruce wood pyrolysis at 500°C was performed and the products were analysed with the help of on-line pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). In addition, thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) experiments were applied for monitoring the product evolution under slow heating conditions (20°C/min) from 50 to 800°C. Levoglucosan is completely eliminated, while acetic acid, furfural and furanes become quite important among cellulose pyrolysis products over the unmodified Al-MCM-41 catalyst. The dominance of phenolic compounds of higher molecular mass is strongly cut back among the lignin products. Both the increase of the yield of acetic acid and furan and the decrease of large methoxyphenols are repressed to some extent over catalysts with enlarged pores. The Cu modified catalyst performed similarly to the catalyst with enlarged pore size in converting the pyrolysis vapours of wood, although its pore size was similar to the unmodified Al-MCM-41.
