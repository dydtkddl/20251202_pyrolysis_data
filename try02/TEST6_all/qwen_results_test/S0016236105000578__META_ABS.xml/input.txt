Pyrolysis of biomass in the presence of Al-MCM-41 type catalysts Al-MCM-41 type mesoporous catalysts were used for converting the pyrolysis vapours of spruce wood in order to obtain better bio-oil properties. Four Al-MCM-41 type catalysts with a Si/Al ratio of 20 were tested. The catalytic properties of Al-MCM-41 catalyst were modified by pore enlargement that allows the processing of larger molecules and by introduction of Cu cations into the structure. Spruce wood pyrolysis at 500°C was performed and the products were analysed with the help of on-line pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). In addition, thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) experiments were applied for monitoring the product evolution under slow heating conditions (20°C/min) from 50 to 800°C. Levoglucosan is completely eliminated, while acetic acid, furfural and furanes become quite important among cellulose pyrolysis products over the unmodified Al-MCM-41 catalyst. The dominance of phenolic compounds of higher molecular mass is strongly cut back among the lignin products. Both the increase of the yield of acetic acid and furan and the decrease of large methoxyphenols are repressed to some extent over catalysts with enlarged pores. The Cu modified catalyst performed similarly to the catalyst with enlarged pore size in converting the pyrolysis vapours of wood, although its pore size was similar to the unmodified Al-MCM-41.
