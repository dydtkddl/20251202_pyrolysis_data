You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrated waste reduction by production of bio-magnetic adsorbents via copyrolysis of waste red mud and residual sugar beet pulp: Target zero waste Red mud, a waste of the aluminum plant, is the result of calcination of bauxite ore with sodium hydroxide at high temperature and concentration. This waste, which is the fearful dream of alumina production factories, attracts attention with its rich iron content. In this study, magnetic activated carbon (MAC) was obtained from the co-pyrolysis of sugar beet pulp and red sludge. The removal of basic yellow basic yellow 5 GL (BY5GL) dyestuff from aqueous solutions was investigated with the obtained MAC. MAC was characterized by X-ray diffraction, F-TIR, SEM-EDX, DSC, VSM and BET surface area. VSM analysis revealed a magnetism of 46.11 emu/g. RSM Taguchi statistical analysis was utilized. According to the L16 orthogonal array consisting of 4 factors and 4 levels, the optimum MAC was obtained at 800 °C, 120 min, 5 impregnation and 0.5 biomass/K2CO3 ratio. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm equations were applied. Pseudo-first, pseudo-second and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models were analyzed. Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second kinetic model gave the best results. It was observed that pH was the most effective parameter for BY5GL adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 175.4 mg.g-1 at pH 7, 20 °C, 360 min contact time, 5 g.L-1 adsorbent dosage and 50 mg.L-1 dyestuff concentration. Activation energy and thermodynamic parameters of the adsorbent were also investigated for dyestuff adsorption.
