You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-energy generation from sagwan sawdust via pyrolysis: Product distributions, characterizations and optimization using response surface methodology Present work demonstrates the pyrolysis of sagwan sawdust for the production of bio-oil and biochar. Thermal degradation characteristics of sawdust by thermo-gravimetric analyzer revealed different zones of degradation. The effects of temperature, nitrogen flow rate and packed bed height were observed and optimized using response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design. For both cases, the quadratic model proved non-linear behaviour of the model response. Co-efficient of determination (R2) value for bio-oil and biochar yield was 0.9905 and 0.9975, respectively justifying excellent fitting of the model. Optimum yield (bio-oil and biochar) were obtained as 48.7083 and 25.5627 wt. %, respectively at the temperature of 640 °C, packed bed height of 8 cm and nitrogen flow rate of 180 mL/min. Presence of various organic compounds and chemicals were confirmed by GC-MS, FTIR analysis and physicochemical analysis described the fuel characteristics. Also, biochar was characterized by proximate and ultimate analysis, HHV, BET, FTIR and SEM-EDX. The above results revealed the utility of bio-oil as engine fuel or source of valuable chemicals. The HHV, porous nature of biochar along with high BET surface area and valuable nutrients indicates its utility as solid fuel, as an adsorbent or in soil amendment.
