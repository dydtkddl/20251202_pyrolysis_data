  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on co-pyrolysis of printed circuit board non-metallic fractions with alumina for bromine removal, but the primary feedstock is e-waste containing brominated flame retardants, not waste plastics or commercial polymers, and the experimental data is not centered on plastic pyrolysis product yields or composition."
