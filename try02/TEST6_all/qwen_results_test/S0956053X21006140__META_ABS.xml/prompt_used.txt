You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of Bromine from the non-metallic fraction in printed circuit board via its Co-pyrolysis with alumina The effectiveness of a recycling approach of the printed circuit board (PCBs), and, thus, the quality of polymeric constituents, primarily rests on the capacity to eliminate the bromine content (mainly as HBr). HBr is emitted in appreciable quantities during thermal decomposition of PCB-contained brominated flame retardants (BFRs). The highly corrosive, yet relatively reactive HBr, renders recovery of bromine-free hydrocarbons streams from brominated polymers in PCBs very challenging. Via combined experimental and theoretical frameworks, this study explores the potential of deploying alumina (Al2O3) as a debromination agent of Br-containing hydrocarbon fractions in PCBs. A consensus from a wide array of characterization techniques utilized herein (ICP-OES, IC, XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDX, and TGA) clearly demonstrates the transformation of alumina upon its co-pyrolysis with the non-metallic fractions of PCBs, into aluminum bromides and oxy-bromides. ICP-OES measurements disclose the presence of high concentration of Cu in the non-metallic fraction of PCB, along with minor levels of selected valuable metals. Likewise, elemental ionic analysis by IC demonstrates an elevated concentration of bromine in washed alumina-PCBs pyrolysates, especially at 500 °C. The Coats-Redfern model facilitates the derivation of thermo-kinetic parameters underpinning the thermal degradation of alumina-PCB mixtures. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) establish an accessible reaction pathway for the HBr uptake by the alumina surface, thus elucidating chemical reactions governing the observed alumina debromination activity. Findings from this study illustrate the capacity of alumina as a HBr fixation agent during the thermal treatment of e-waste.
