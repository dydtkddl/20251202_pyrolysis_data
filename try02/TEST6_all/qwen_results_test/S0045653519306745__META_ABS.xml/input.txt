Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation during the fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste Health-care waste management is a challenge for the health sector. Currently, pyrolysis technologies are being used to treat medical waste that can convert it to a hydrocarbon fuel. In the present study, hazardous health-care waste was pyrolyzed using a continuous tubular fast pyrolysis reactor. Mass balance analysis and formation of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by USEPA as priority pollutants, and was studied during the pyrolysis process in a wide range of operation conditions, i.e., reaction temperature (300–700 °C), residence time (100–190 s) and waste particle size (1–3 cm). Response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were applied to optimize the operating variables. Cracking and decomposition of feedstock occurred almost optimally in 700 °C resulting in the generation of 73.4% liquid and 24.1% char. The PAHs were characterized in significant concentrations in pyrolytic oil (121–29440 mg/lit) and char (223–1610 mg/kg) products. The formation of total USEPA listed PAH components varied by the operating ranges of temperature, residence time and waste size. In the pyrolytic oil phase, the formation of total PAHs was drastically increased by increasing the waste particle size. It is also found that increasing the temperature and having longer residence times have a high influence on the total 16 USEPA PAHs formation rate in the char phase. It is concluded that fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste, as thermal treatment method, would influence the formation and destruction of PAHs and their fraction to a different extent depending on the role of operating variables.
