You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation during the fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste Health-care waste management is a challenge for the health sector. Currently, pyrolysis technologies are being used to treat medical waste that can convert it to a hydrocarbon fuel. In the present study, hazardous health-care waste was pyrolyzed using a continuous tubular fast pyrolysis reactor. Mass balance analysis and formation of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by USEPA as priority pollutants, and was studied during the pyrolysis process in a wide range of operation conditions, i.e., reaction temperature (300–700 °C), residence time (100–190 s) and waste particle size (1–3 cm). Response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were applied to optimize the operating variables. Cracking and decomposition of feedstock occurred almost optimally in 700 °C resulting in the generation of 73.4% liquid and 24.1% char. The PAHs were characterized in significant concentrations in pyrolytic oil (121–29440 mg/lit) and char (223–1610 mg/kg) products. The formation of total USEPA listed PAH components varied by the operating ranges of temperature, residence time and waste size. In the pyrolytic oil phase, the formation of total PAHs was drastically increased by increasing the waste particle size. It is also found that increasing the temperature and having longer residence times have a high influence on the total 16 USEPA PAHs formation rate in the char phase. It is concluded that fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste, as thermal treatment method, would influence the formation and destruction of PAHs and their fraction to a different extent depending on the role of operating variables.
