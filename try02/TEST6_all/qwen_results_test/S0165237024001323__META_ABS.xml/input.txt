Understanding the role of CFD in microwave-assisted pyrolysis for biomass conversion This review systematically examines the role of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in enhancing the understanding of microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) for efficient biomass conversion into valuable chemicals. By critically analyzing recent advancements in CFD modeling, this paper highlights the significant contributions of CFD to optimize process parameters, improve reactor designs, and predict the yield and quality of bio-oil, biochar, and syngas. The synthesis of literature reveals key insights into the microwave energy absorption mechanisms, thermal and electromagnetic field distributions, and their impact on pyrolysis outcomes. The novelty of this review lies in its comprehensive aggregation of CFD-based studies, offering a holistic understanding of MAP processes, identifying gaps in current research, and proposing future directions for integrating CFD simulations with experimental studies to advance biomass conversion technologies.
