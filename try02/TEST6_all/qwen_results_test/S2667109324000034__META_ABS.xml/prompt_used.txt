You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atomically engineering the metal-support interaction of single-atom Cu/TiO2 for efficient polyethylene terephthalate plastic photoreforming Photoreforming with metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) holds promise to transform plastic waste into valuable chemicals. However, optimizing the electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) to enhance SAC activity and stability remains a significant challenge. Herein, we develop Cu/TiO2 SACs for photoreforming polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. By engineering the local atomic environments around copper (Cu) single atoms (SAs), we achieve a controlled EMSI. The stronger EMSI not only boosts the charge state of Cu SAs, facilitating faster charge transfer and separation, but also induces a narrower band gap to TiO2 support, improving light absorption. Furthermore, the robust EMSI enhances the overall stability of Cu/TiO2 SACs. Over the optimal Cu/TiO2 SACs, PET plastic is upcycled into organic acids (145.4 μmol gcatalyst −1 h−1), alongside H2 generation (193.6 μmol gcatalyst −1 h−1), surpassing bare TiO2 by 25 times and positioning it among the state of the art. The employed atomic engineering strategy for modulating the EMSI offers an efficient approach for designing active and stable SACs.
