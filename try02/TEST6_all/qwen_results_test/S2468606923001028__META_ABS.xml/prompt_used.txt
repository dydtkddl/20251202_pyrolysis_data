You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Copper(II)-porphyrin functionalized titanium(IV) metal-organic aerogels for the visible-light driven conversion of CO2 to alcohols This manuscript covers the synthesis and characterization of a series of titanium based metal-organic aerogels (MOAs) functionalized with copper(II)-metalated porphyrins for their application in visible-light-driven carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to alcohols. A thorough characterization is performed using a set of spectroscopic and microstructural analysis techniques to reveal the structural and microstructural features that can aid in establishing structure-activity relationships. The parent MOAs consist of metal-organic nanoparticles (5–10 nm) crosslinked into a highly porous microstructure (surface area: 600–800 m2·g−1). The post-synthetic reaction with copper(II) enables the metalation of the tetrapyrrole ring of porphyrin, which is confirmed by analyzing the absorption and luminescence spectra. High-angle annular dark-field electron microscopy imaging demonstrates a uniform distribution of the metalation throughout the nanoparticles that compose the material. The CO2 photoreduction experiments performed in an optofluidic microreactor show that the metalation markedly invigorates the total alcohol (methanol and ethanol) production rates and apparent quantum yields (AQY), from 21 to 367 μmol·g−1·h−1 (AQY: 0.4–7%) prior to metalation to values of 356–642 μmol·g−1·h−1 (AQY: 11–20%). Additionally, the metalation inverts the selectivity towards ethanol, increasing from 0–12% in the parent MOA to 67–76% after incorporating Cu(II).
