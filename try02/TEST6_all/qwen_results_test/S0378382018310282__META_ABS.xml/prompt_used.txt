You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass over zeolites for high quality bio-oil – A review Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a prominent technology for yielding high quality bio-oil and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass while the application of catalyst has been a hotspot for being capable to deoxygenate bio-oil and enhance its fuel properties. The fundamental reaction pathways in catalytic fast pyrolysis and potential routes of bio-oil and chemicals production from three major individual components are discussed at the early section of the review. The effect and potentiality of solid acid catalyst mainly zeolites, biomass particle size and catalyst loading ratio on the yield and quality of bio-oil are then emphasized. In addition, the lumped kinetic model and distributed activation energy model (DAEM), used to predict the thermal behavior of biomass components and energy calculation in catalytic pyrolysis are described. The recent advances in the understanding of catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with hydrogen rich co-feeder from different sources are also presented. The progress with technical difficulties in catalytic pyrolysis is pointed out having an intention to produce high quality bio-oil. Finally, some challenges and perspectives of improving bio-oil quality through catalytic fast pyrolysis that will be significant approach in the future research work are presented.
