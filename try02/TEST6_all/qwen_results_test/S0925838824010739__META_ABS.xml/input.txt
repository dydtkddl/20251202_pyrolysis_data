3D printing of soft magnetic materials: From printing to applications Soft magnetic functional materials exhibit low coercivity, low power loss, and high permeability, making them highly utilized in power electronic devices. In some cases, soft magnetic components with intricate architectures are required to accomplish various tasks. The multi-material and multi-scale fabrication ability of three-dimensional printing (3DP) provides a new way for manufacturing soft magnetic devices with complex structures. The aim of the present work is to consolidate the latest advancements in the 3DP of soft magnetic materials (SMMs). The goal is to inspire future research directions by highlighting existing gaps in knowledge and potential areas for innovation. This paper summarizes recent research on 3DP of SMMs. Studies on 3DP of SMMs, such as Fe-Si and Fe-Ni alloys and soft magnetic ferrites and composites, are reviewed. Moreover, several mainstream 3DP procedures have been introduced. Furthermore, application scenarios of 3DP SMMs, including electronic components and magnetic-drive robots, are covered. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of 3DP SMMs are discussed.
