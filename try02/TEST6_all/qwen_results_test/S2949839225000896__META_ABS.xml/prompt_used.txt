You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimized biofuel production from Triplochiton scleroxylon sawdust via microwave-assisted pyrolysis and hydrocracking: Process analysis and production revenue forecasting with Aspen Plus Biomass has historically been a key fuel source for activities like cooking and heating for millennia, yet modern energy demands and environmental challenges necessitate advanced methods to convert lignocellulosic waste into sustainable fuels. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis and hydrocracking show promise for biofuel production; optimizing these for lesser-studied feedstocks like Triplochiton scleroxylon sawdust can improve yield, scalability, and cost-effective biofuel upgrading in biorefineries. After performing a physiochemical analysis of the sawdust, response surface methodology using a centered composite design was applied to examine how various pyrolysis determinants affect bio-oil generation and assist in establishing the best processing settings. The variables studied include microwave power, irradiation time, and the percentage of biochar employed for wave absorption. The findings revealed that Triplochiton scleroxylon sawdust possesses valuable properties for bio-oil formulation, featuring a substantial proportion of volatile components (74.2 ± 2 %) with a reduced ash level (2.9 ± 0.5 %). Enhancement results showed that all pyrolysis factors had significant impacts, with a 5 % level of statistical significance. Peak bio-oil output, 34.6 %, was realized under the following experimental settings: microwave power of 650 W, 20 min. of irradiation, and 20 % absorbent intake. The resulting bio-oil had a pH of 4.8 ± 0.4, a water content of 22 ± 2.3 %, and a heating value of 17.5 ± 0.8 MJ/kg. Considering an optimal desirability rate of 0.708, the hydrocracking plan design perspectives forecasted as production metrics: 183.7 kg/h of gasoline and 35.9 kg/h of biodiesel from 1 ton/h of sawdust with a total production cost of 163,848.183 CFA francs. These observations confirm Triplochiton scleroxylon sawdust as a viable, cost-effective source for scalable biofuel production.
