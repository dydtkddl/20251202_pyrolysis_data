You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improved scheme for the analysis of high-purity talc An improved method is proposed for the determination of silica, magnesium oxide, R2O3, ferric oxide, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide in high-purity talc. In the method for silica and magnesium oxide, the sample is fused with sodium carbonate and the cooled melt is dissolved with perchloric acid in such a manner that it floats free from the crucible (in previous schemes for the analysis of talc there are frequently mechanical losses due to the difficulty of removing the magnesium silicate melt from the crucible). The solution is then evaporated to fumes of perchloric acid and the silica is filtered off and ignited. The magnesium oxide is determined in the filtrate by precipitation as magnesium ammonium phosphate and a correction is made for the calcium which is precipitated along with the magnesium ammonium phosphate. R2O3 is determined after treatment of the sample with nitric and hydrofluoric acids and evaporation to fumes of perchloric acid. Iron oxide and calcium oxide are determined by atomic absorption, after treatment with nitric and hydrofluoric acids and evaporation to fumes of perchloric acid. Al2O3 is calculated by difference.
