A Study on the Pyrolysis of CHF3 Experiments were carried out to explore the pyrolysis of CHF3 fire extinguishing agent in a stainless tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure and temperatures from 600 to 850°C versus various residence times of 2-15 s. The decomposition of CHF3 commence around 650°C. As reaction temperature rises and residence time prolongs, the pyrolysis of CHF3 is intensified, which makes the concentration of CHF3 plummet, the yields of main products C3F6, i-C4F8 and HF increase and the yield of C2F4 decreases after its peak. The explanations of the formation of these products are proposed by the formation, dimerization, trimerization, disproportionation and other reactions of CF2:, which meets well with the various yields of HF and other experimental results.
