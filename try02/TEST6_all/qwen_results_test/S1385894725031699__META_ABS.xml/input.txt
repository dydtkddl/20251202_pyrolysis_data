Thermochemical conversion and gasification of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in supercritical CO2: A sustainable approach to plastic waste management This study explores the thermochemical gasification of HDPE in a Sc-CO2 environment, presenting a sustainable pathway for plastic waste valorization. The unique physicochemical properties of Sc-CO2—acting as both a solvent and reactive agent—enhanced polymer decomposition, facilitated selective syngas production, and promoted gas-phase reforming reactions. The effects of temperature, reaction time, and CO2 pressure on carbon conversion efficiency (CE) and hydrogen conversion efficiency (HE) were systematically investigated. Optimal performance was achieved at 700 °C and 20 min, yielding a maximum CE of 65 % and an HE of 98 %, accompanied by significant increases in H2 and CO production. Morphological and structural analyses revealed that Sc-CO2 improved mass transfer, suppressed excessive tar and char formation, and promoted the formation of spherical carbonaceous structures. Comparative evaluation with conventional air and steam gasification demonstrated that Sc-CO2 enabled effective operation at lower temperatures while enhancing product selectivity and carbon utilization. These results position Sc-CO2 gasification as a promising alternative for integrated plastic waste valorization and carbon resource recovery. Further research into catalytic enhancement and process intensification is required to improve scalability and techno-economic viability.
