You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Asphalt pyro-rejuvenators based on waste tyres: An approach to improve the rheological and self-healing properties of aged binders Waste Tyres (WT) are a significant fraction of industrial waste and a source of environmental hazards with limited valorisation. To reduce this problem, currently there is a growing interest in valuing the WT through pyrolysis to obtain multifunctional liquids to improve the rheological and self-healing properties of aged binders. This research provides a comprehensive study on using WT mixtures as precursors for asphalt rejuvenators by means of pyrolysis and distillation processes. To this end, WT polymeric fractions from light (WT-L) and mining trucks (WT-M) were used as feedstock and characterised for compositional and thermal properties. Additionally, micropyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) was used to identify the major products in pyrolysis vapours, to elucidate the reaction maps describing thermal degradation of WTs and to predict the feasible reaction conditions. The pyrolysis liquids were produced after a screening of reaction conditions and subjected to distillation, following a response surface model to produce an optimised pyro-rejuvenator. The results showed that the pyrolytic rejuvenator obtained through pyrolysis at 465 °C and distillation cutting at 160–200 °C is mainly composed of hydrocarbons and aromatic substances (95.5%), with a significant proportion of limonene (33.71%). Furthermore, the pyrolytic rejuvenator exhibited highly desirable physical properties in the context of its application and excellent oxidative stability (85.7%). Otherwise, it was determined that bitumen mixtures with 3%–6% doses of pyro-rejuvenator improved the viscosity, softening point, and penetration of aged binders, restoring their physical properties to the virgin state. In conclusion, pyro-rejuvenators can be successfully used as a promising solution to produce more durable and sustainable pavements with improved rheological and healing properties.
