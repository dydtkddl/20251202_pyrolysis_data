Bacterial cellulose: A promising biopolymer with interesting properties and applications The ever-increasing demands for materials with desirable properties led to the development of materials that impose unfavorable influences on the environment and the ecosystem. Developing a low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly functional material with biological origins has become necessary to avoid these consequences. Bacterial cellulose generated by bacteria dispenses excellent structural and functional properties and satisfies these requirements. BC and BC-derived materials are essential in developing pure and environmentally safe functional materials. This review offers a detailed understanding of the biosynthesis of BC, properties, various functionalization methods, and applicability in biomedical, water treatment, food storage, energy conversion, and energy storage applications.
