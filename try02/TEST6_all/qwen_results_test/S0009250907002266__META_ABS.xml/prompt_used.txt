You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental, kinetic and 2-D reactor modeling for simulation of the production of hydrogen by the catalytic reforming of concentrated crude ethanol (CRCCE) over a Ni-based commercial catalyst in a packed-bed tubular reactor Mechanistic kinetic models were formulated based on Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson and Eley–Rideal approaches to describe the kinetics of hydrogen production by the catalytic reforming of concentrated crude ethanol over a Ni-based commercial catalyst at atmospheric pressure, temperature range of 673–863K, ratio of weight of catalyst to the molar rate of crude ethanol 3472–34722kgcats/kmolcrude in a stainless steel packed bed tubular microreactor. One of the models yielded an excellent degree of correlation, and was selected for the simulation of the reforming process which used a pseudo-homogeneous numerical model consisting of coupled material and energy balance equations with reaction. The model was solved using finite elements method without neglecting the axial dispersion term. The crude ethanol conversion predicted by the model was in good agreement with the experimental data ( AAD %= 4.28 ) . Also, the predicted concentration and temperature profiles for the process in the radial direction indicate that the assumption of plug flow isothermal behavior is justified within certain reactor configurations. However, the axial dispersion term still contributed to the results, and thus, cannot be neglected.
