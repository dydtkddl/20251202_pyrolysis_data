You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical kinetic modeling of the H/S system: H2S thermolysis and H2 sulfidation A detailed chemical mechanism to describe reactions in the H2-S2-H2S system has been constructed.The mechanism comprises 21 reactions among the species H2S, S2, H2, HSSH, HSS, SH, S, and H. The structure of the mechanism resembles closely that of the H2-O2 system. For a few reactions, experimental values for rate constants were taken from the literature, but the kinetics of most of the reactions have been studied theoretically, using a combination of transition state theory for bimolecular reactions, master equation calculations for unimolecular decompositions, and QRRK methods for chemically activated reactions. The mechanism has been validated against a diverse collection of published data for H2S thermolysis in a static cell or in flow reactors, for temperatures ranging from 873 to 1423 K, pressures from 0.04 to 3 bar, and H2S mole fraction from 0.02 to 1. The predictions of the mechanism are sensitive only to the rates of the processes responsible for S-S bond formation, HSS + H ⇌ 2SH ( R 8 ) HSSH ( + M ) ⇌ 2SH ( + M ) ( R 9 ) HSSH + H ⇌ H 2 S + SH ( R 16 ) Slight adjustment of these rates allows the data to be modeled accurately. Data for the reverse, hydrogen sulfidation reaction (H2+S2) are also modeled very accurately. This comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanism for the H/S system not only describes a wide range of experimental data but also provides the basis for the construction of accurate models for H2S oxidation in combustion and related systems.
