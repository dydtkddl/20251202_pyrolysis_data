You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Harnessing the optimization strategy via interpretable machine learning framework for high-efficiency pyrolysis-catalysis engineering of plastic wastes Conventional pyrolysis-catalysis recycling of plastic wastes into high-value and clean hydrogen relys on laborious trial-and-error protocol, facing challenge due to high-dimensional and nonlinear nature of catalyst and process optimization for hydrogen production. Accurate prediction of H2 production and systematic optimization of pyrolysis-catalysis is crucial for plastic wastes valorization. In this work, an interpretable machine learning framework integrating hierarchical data mining, model training, interpretability analysis and inverse optimization was leveraged to predict hydrogen production, simultaneously grasping the complex correlations between variables. Several advanced tree regressor models are developed using feedstock composition, catalyst properties and process parameters as input features. The results showed that random forest model demonstrated the highest predictive performance with R2 of 0.88 and RMSE of 9.78. The causal analytics using Shapley Additive exPlanations identified the significant features of steam flow, metal loading and catalyst-to-feedstock ratio on hydrogen prediction. Data mining and partial dependence analysis revealed that proper metal loading of around 15 wt% when paired with a steam flow rate of 5 g/h could effectively regulate catalytic process to achieve the desired H2 yield. Transition metal-based catalysts with moderate porosity of approximately 100 m2/g and pore volume of 0.2–0.3 cm3/g, as well as catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 0.8 have the potential to promote enhanced hydrogen selectivity and favorable product distributions. By harnessing the machine learning techniques, the hierarchical data-driven approach endowed insights into the rational selection of catalyst, and the identification of optimal operational conditions for sustainable hydrogen production from plastic wastes.
