You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on microwave assisted thermal remediation of hydrocarbons contaminated soil: Influential factors, mechanism, and prospective This review provides an overview of current research on thermal methods for remediating soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons, with a specific focus on microwave-assisted heating treatment. Initially, it broadly surveys and analyses existing studies on various thermal remediation techniques, in particular thermal desorption, pyrolysis, and incineration. The challenges of high temperatures, prolonged treatment durations, and substantial energy consumption underlying conventional heating methods were therefore summarised. Microwave heating approach was paid paramount attention in current review due to its distinct characteristics and widespread application in many fields, e.g. water treatment, solid waste management, and soil remediation. It offers distinct advantages over traditional thermal treatment methods, especially lower treatment temperatures, higher rates of pollutant recovery, and a very minimal disruption to soil biology. This paper then delves into the application and mechanisms of petroleum removal through microwave-assisted thermal remediation, and influential factors including soil and pollutant properties, the use of microwave-absorbing materials, and the effects of microwave radiation parameters were reviewed consequently. It can be concluded that microwave susceptors, irradiation power, and exposure duration, play crucial roles in optimising pollutant removal efficiency. While the technology offers significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption, a lower carbon footprint, and shorter remediation times, it is predominantly limited to ex situ applications due to constraints related to microwave penetration depth. Future research directions are proposed to enhance the effectiveness and practicality of microwave-assisted remediation in industrial contexts, emphasising the importance of scaling up laboratory findings to real-world scenarios.
