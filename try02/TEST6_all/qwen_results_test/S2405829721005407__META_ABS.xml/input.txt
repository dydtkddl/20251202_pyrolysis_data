Anatase titanium dioxide as rechargeable ion battery electrode - A chronological review Anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted considerable attention as a promising alternative rechargeable ion battery electrode due to excellent operation safety, good reversible capacity, huge natural abundance, and good environmental friendliness. However, several intrinsic critical drawbacks including relatively low capacity and poor electric conductivity significantly limit its practical application. Large amount of research has been performed to solve these issues, resulting in three well-developed optimization strategies including decreasing the material size to nanoscale, compositing anatase TiO2 with electron conductive components, and constructing hierarchical structures. In this review, considerable studies about anatase TiO2 electrode materials are summarized in a chronological perspective. Unique insights into the general and detailed evolution trends of the research on applications of anatase TiO2 electrode materials in energy storage devices are provided. In addition, a spotlight on the future trends to advance both the fundamental understanding and practical applications of the anatase TiO2 electrode materials is provided.
