You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Poly(para-phenylene) fibers – Characterization and preliminary data for conversion to carbon fiber Given the exceptionally high thermal stability of poly (para-phenylene) (PPP) among linear polyaromatics, it is expected that PPP fibers will have myriad applications. In this study, PPP fibers were obtained starting from the enzymatic dihydroxylation/reduction of benzene to 5,6-cis-dihydroxycyclohexa-1,3-diene, followed by esterification, polymerization, and thermal aromatization. Polymer precursor was characterized in terms of its thermal and rheological properties. High levels of aromatization were achieved, and the obtained PPP fibers were mostly para-linked. Carbonization of PPP fibers by pyrolysis was studied at different temperatures (600–1500 °C). Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy results showed that PPP transformed into disordered carbon at temperatures above 800 °C, similarly to commercial carbon fiber (CF). Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that PPP fibers and CFs had smooth surfaces, were nonporous, and retained their original fiber shape during the aromatization and carbonization steps. Our research highlights the high potential of using PPP as an alternate precursor to CF.
