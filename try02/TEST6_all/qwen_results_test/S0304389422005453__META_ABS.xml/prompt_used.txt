You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into the removal of polystyrene nanoplastics using the contaminated corncob-derived mesoporous biochar from mining area Nanoplastic has become a prominent threat to the aquatic ecosystem, and the cost-effective technologies for controlling that are still insufficient. The aim of this study is to use contaminated corncobs collected in mining area to prepare functional mesoporous biochar (MBC) and to investigate its ability to remove polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) from water. The adsorption of PSNPs by MBC could be better described by the Sips isotherm and followed the second-order kinetics, with the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of MBC for PSNPs was 56.02 mg·g−1. Then the PSNPs adsorbed on MBC could be hydrothermally degraded and the biochar could be simultaneously regenerated. The ability was affected by various factors, including oxygen-containing functional groups, metallic components, superoxide radicals and holes. The degradation products were dominated as low-molecule-weight oligomers and the main possible pathways involved scission, hydrolysis and radical reaction. The findings highlight the great potential of biochar prepared using contaminated biowaste in mining area to remove the nanoplastic pollutants in the aqueous environment.
