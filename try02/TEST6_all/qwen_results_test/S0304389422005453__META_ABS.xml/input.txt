Insights into the removal of polystyrene nanoplastics using the contaminated corncob-derived mesoporous biochar from mining area Nanoplastic has become a prominent threat to the aquatic ecosystem, and the cost-effective technologies for controlling that are still insufficient. The aim of this study is to use contaminated corncobs collected in mining area to prepare functional mesoporous biochar (MBC) and to investigate its ability to remove polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) from water. The adsorption of PSNPs by MBC could be better described by the Sips isotherm and followed the second-order kinetics, with the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of MBC for PSNPs was 56.02 mg·g−1. Then the PSNPs adsorbed on MBC could be hydrothermally degraded and the biochar could be simultaneously regenerated. The ability was affected by various factors, including oxygen-containing functional groups, metallic components, superoxide radicals and holes. The degradation products were dominated as low-molecule-weight oligomers and the main possible pathways involved scission, hydrolysis and radical reaction. The findings highlight the great potential of biochar prepared using contaminated biowaste in mining area to remove the nanoplastic pollutants in the aqueous environment.
