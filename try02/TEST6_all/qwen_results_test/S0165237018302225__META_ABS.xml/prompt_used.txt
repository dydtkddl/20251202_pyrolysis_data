You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Segmented catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and high-density polyethylene for aromatics production with MgCl2 and HZSM-5 For the catalytic co-pyrolysis of glucose and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor, the effects of different layout schemes of feedstock and catalysts on bio-oil yield and aromatics selectivity were investigated based on the Diels-Alder reaction of furans and short-chain olefins on HZSM-5 for aromatics production. Experimental results showed that the arrangement (HDPE/HZSM-5/glucose/HZSM-5) had advantages on bio-oil yield and aromatics selectivity. A mixture of pine sawdust and MgCl2 as a glucose substitute that provided furan compounds (Furfural) reacted with short-chain olefins for aromatics production. We found that acquiring high selectivity of aromatic bio-oil from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and HDPE with MgCl2 and HZSM-5 is feasible. The effects of co-pyrolysis temperature, biomass to HDPE ratio, and feedstock to catalyst ratio on bio-oil yield and chemical compositions were discussed. Notably, an appropriate ratio between the amounts of furans and short-chain olefins is necessary for increasing bio-oil yield and aromatics selectivity. Maximum oil phase product yield of 20.6% and aromatics selectivity (area %) of 95.9% were obtained when pyrolysis temperature, biomass to HDPE ratio, and feedstock to catalyst ratio were 600 ℃, 1:2, and 1:1, respectively.
