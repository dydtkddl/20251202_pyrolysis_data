You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fluidized bed synthesis of carbon nanotubes – A review Carbon nanotube is one of the most talked about materials in recent years due to its unique properties and potential applications in different fields. Out of different techniques, catalytic chemical vapour deposition in a fluidized bed is the most promising technique for bulk production of this exotic material. The objectives of this review are to bring out the science and technology behind this process, the present commercial scenario and to draw a future roadmap. We have critically examined the published literature on the nanoparticle fluidization, different forces involved in it and the hydrodynamics of a nano-agglomerate fluidized bed. The importance of use of discrete elemental method and computational fluid dynamics simulation in the fluidization of carbon nanotubes has also been highlighted. Different preparation routes of catalyst materials have been compiled. The reaction and growth mechanisms of nanotubes, including modeling have been discussed. The data on the effects of different process parameters on the quality and quantity of nanotubes have been critically analyzed. It has been indicated that the available data are scattered in nature and further understanding in the mechanism is required in order to find out the rate controlling step(s) and scale-up of the process. The present commercial scenario of carbon nanotube market has been depicted. At the end, based on the present knowledge gaps, future roadmaps have been suggested.
