Spent tea waste extract as a green modifying agent of chitosan for aspirin adsorption: Fixed-bed column, modeling and toxicity studies Aspirin is a prevalent over-the-counter medicine that has been categorized as an emerging contaminant due to its danger to both living things and the environment. This work presents chitosan modified with spent tea waste extract (STWE) via the wet impregnation method as an adsorbent for the enhanced removal of aspirin in a fixed-bed column. The adsorbent (named chitosan-STWE) was successfully synthesized and exhibited a low crystallinity structure, good stability against thermal and acidic conditions, as depicted by HNMR, XRD, TGA, and the dissolution rate of the adsorbent. The adsorption column study reveals that increasing bed height (up to 6 cm) increases the percentage of aspirin removal (up to 40.8 %). Increasing aspirin concentration enhances the amount of aspirin that comes into contact with the chitosan-STWE adsorbent, thereby increasing the adsorption capacity. On the other hand, higher flow rates result in shorter contact times between the adsorbent and adsorbates, which lowers the quantity of aspirin adsorbed. The experimental data are in accordance with the values generated by the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models, with the maximum adsorption capacity of 61.7 mg/g. The chitosan-STWE adsorbent was determined to be non-toxic, thus safe to be used in wastewater treatment applications.
