Co-pyrolytic investigation of waste bakelite with different thermoplastics using microwave and conventional batch pyrolysis reactor Bakelite, a thermosetting plastic, is harder to recycle as compared to than thermoplastic polymers through thermal method due to its inherent property to harden on application of heat. This study co-pyrolyzes waste bakelite with polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in a conventional semi-batch pyrolysis reactor and microwave pyrolysis reactor to determine how the reactor type and thermoplastic blending affect product distribution, yield, and composition of condensable fraction. The blending of thermoplastics and pyrolysis reactor types greatly affects product distribution. Bakelite, on pyrolysis, produces 39.12 wt% condensable product, which increased to 45.42 wt%, 58.76 wt%, 61.53 wt%, and 66.76 wt% in conventional pyrolysis and 49.87 wt%, 61.26 wt%, 66.51 wt%, and 72.88 wt% in microwave pyrolysis by blending HDPE, PP, PMMA, and PS respectively. The composition analysis through Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes, aromatics, and oxygenated compounds, from both pyrolysis processes. However, their percentage differ significantly in both processes. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis with activated carbon yields superior oil in both quantity and composition compared to conventional pyrolysis, effectively transforming waste plastics into valuable products.
