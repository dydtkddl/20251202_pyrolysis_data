You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolytic investigation of waste bakelite with different thermoplastics using microwave and conventional batch pyrolysis reactor Bakelite, a thermosetting plastic, is harder to recycle as compared to than thermoplastic polymers through thermal method due to its inherent property to harden on application of heat. This study co-pyrolyzes waste bakelite with polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in a conventional semi-batch pyrolysis reactor and microwave pyrolysis reactor to determine how the reactor type and thermoplastic blending affect product distribution, yield, and composition of condensable fraction. The blending of thermoplastics and pyrolysis reactor types greatly affects product distribution. Bakelite, on pyrolysis, produces 39.12 wt% condensable product, which increased to 45.42 wt%, 58.76 wt%, 61.53 wt%, and 66.76 wt% in conventional pyrolysis and 49.87 wt%, 61.26 wt%, 66.51 wt%, and 72.88 wt% in microwave pyrolysis by blending HDPE, PP, PMMA, and PS respectively. The composition analysis through Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes, aromatics, and oxygenated compounds, from both pyrolysis processes. However, their percentage differ significantly in both processes. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis with activated carbon yields superior oil in both quantity and composition compared to conventional pyrolysis, effectively transforming waste plastics into valuable products.
