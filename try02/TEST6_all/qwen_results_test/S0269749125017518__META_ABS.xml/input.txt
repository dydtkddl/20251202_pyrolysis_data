Assessing the degradation of polyester fibres from different textiles: A simulation based on laundry release Polyester (PES) is one of the main synthetic polymers used by the textile industry. The fate of PES microfibres in the environment depends on various parameters including photodegradation and fibres characteristics. In this study, the release and subsequent degradation of PES fibres before and after domestic washing were investigated, using accelerated hydrolytic degradation simulations. Fibres from differently manufactured PES textiles (undyed and dyed fabrics, whole garments) were obtained by cutting the textiles or by washing them in a household washing machine and collecting the fibres released. Degradation simulations of the fibres were performed using an alkaline solution. Hence, this is the first study that employed microfibres directly released during laundry in degradation experiments, to provide a realistic approach. Fibres were analysed in order to compare the effect of the degradation on the differently manufactured textiles, while analyses of the degradation solutions were, also, performed for polyester degradation product quantification and leachates identification. Degradation of PES fibres was evident, with changes in colour, mass loss and PES degradation products increasing throughout the process. Higher fibre loss, double quantity of terephthalic acid (PES product) and higher reduction of vinyl benzoate (PES marker) indicated more substantial degradation of the fibres from garments than those from the fabrics. Non-target analysis of the degradation solutions performed by HPLC-HRMS/MS also indicated that a greater release of leachates including dyes and additives (e.g. 4-nitrophenol, disperse orange 3, phenyldiethanolamine, and acetoacetanilide) occurred during the simulated degradation of the garment fibres, compared to the fabric ones.
