You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bioglass and nano bioglass: A next-generation biomaterial for therapeutic and regenerative medicine applications Biomaterials are an indispensable component in tissue engineering that primarily functions to resemble the extracellular matrix of any tissue targeted for regeneration. In the last five decades, bioglass has been extensively used in the field of therapeutic and tissue engineering. The doping of metal components into bioglass and the synthesizing of nano bioglass particles have found remarkable implications, both in vivo and in vitro. These include various medical and biological applications such as rejuvenating tissues, facilitating regeneration, and delivering biomolecules into cells and therapy, etc. Therefore, the current review discusses the various techniques used in synthesizing bioglass particles, trends of various ion-doped nano bioglass, and their applications in therapy as well as in regenerative medicine, specifically in the fields of dentistry, cardiovascular, skin, nervous, and respiratory systems. Apart from these, this review also emphasizes the bioglass combined with diverse natural polymers (like collagen, chitosan, etc.) and their applications. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness of bioglass properties such as antibacterial effects, biomolecular delivery systems, tissue compatibility, and regenerative material. Finally, the prospects and limitations are elaborated.
