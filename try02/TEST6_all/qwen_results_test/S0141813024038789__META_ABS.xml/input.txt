Bioglass and nano bioglass: A next-generation biomaterial for therapeutic and regenerative medicine applications Biomaterials are an indispensable component in tissue engineering that primarily functions to resemble the extracellular matrix of any tissue targeted for regeneration. In the last five decades, bioglass has been extensively used in the field of therapeutic and tissue engineering. The doping of metal components into bioglass and the synthesizing of nano bioglass particles have found remarkable implications, both in vivo and in vitro. These include various medical and biological applications such as rejuvenating tissues, facilitating regeneration, and delivering biomolecules into cells and therapy, etc. Therefore, the current review discusses the various techniques used in synthesizing bioglass particles, trends of various ion-doped nano bioglass, and their applications in therapy as well as in regenerative medicine, specifically in the fields of dentistry, cardiovascular, skin, nervous, and respiratory systems. Apart from these, this review also emphasizes the bioglass combined with diverse natural polymers (like collagen, chitosan, etc.) and their applications. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness of bioglass properties such as antibacterial effects, biomolecular delivery systems, tissue compatibility, and regenerative material. Finally, the prospects and limitations are elaborated.
