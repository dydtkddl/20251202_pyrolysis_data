Growth control and functionalization design of vertically arranged carbon nanotubes: From basic research to industrial applications Vertically arranged carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) are composed of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. Their one-dimensional tubular structure perpendicular to the substrate forms highly consistent one-dimensional channels, endowing the material with significant anisotropy. Compared with ordinary carbon nanotubes (CNTs), VACNTs, due to their regularly arranged structural characteristics, exhibit superior electrical conductivity (> 105 S/cm), ultra-high thermal conductivity (> 3000 W/m·K), and high strength (> 50 GPa), and have great application potential in multiple fields. However, large-scale production still faces three major bottlenecks: poor synthesis uniformity, topological defects of the tube wall, and insufficient process repeatability. This paper systematically reviews the synthetic regulation strategies and synthesis mechanisms of VACNTs, focusing on four core issues including the optimization of synthesis methods and catalyst design. It reveals the common challenges in its large-scale preparation and summarizes the latest applications and development directions in thermal management, energy storage, and composite materials, providing theoretical and technical guidance for basic research and engineering applications.
