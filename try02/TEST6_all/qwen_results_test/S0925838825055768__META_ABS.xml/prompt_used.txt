You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Growth control and functionalization design of vertically arranged carbon nanotubes: From basic research to industrial applications Vertically arranged carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) are composed of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. Their one-dimensional tubular structure perpendicular to the substrate forms highly consistent one-dimensional channels, endowing the material with significant anisotropy. Compared with ordinary carbon nanotubes (CNTs), VACNTs, due to their regularly arranged structural characteristics, exhibit superior electrical conductivity (> 105 S/cm), ultra-high thermal conductivity (> 3000 W/m·K), and high strength (> 50 GPa), and have great application potential in multiple fields. However, large-scale production still faces three major bottlenecks: poor synthesis uniformity, topological defects of the tube wall, and insufficient process repeatability. This paper systematically reviews the synthetic regulation strategies and synthesis mechanisms of VACNTs, focusing on four core issues including the optimization of synthesis methods and catalyst design. It reveals the common challenges in its large-scale preparation and summarizes the latest applications and development directions in thermal management, energy storage, and composite materials, providing theoretical and technical guidance for basic research and engineering applications.
