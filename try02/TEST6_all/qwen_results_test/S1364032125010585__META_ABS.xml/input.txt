Advances and challenges in biomass thermochemical conversion: From resource utilization to process optimization Biomass thermochemical conversion represents a critical pathway for achieving carbon neutrality and sustainable energy production; however, its large-scale deployment remains constrained by significant technological and economic barriers. This review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, employed rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria and systematically searched the Web of Science database to identify and evaluate relevant studies. Recent developments in pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion are examined with emphasis on conversion methodologies, operating conditions, catalyst systems, and reactor configurations, focusing on process efficiency, product distribution, and environmental performance. Major challenges include the elevated oxygen content of bio-oil, tar generation during gasification, catalyst deactivation, and emission control in combustion processes. Emerging approaches, including microwave-assisted processing and catalytic reforming, have demonstrated improvements in bio-oil quality and hydrogen yield, while chemical looping gasification effectively suppresses tar formation and enables intrinsic carbon capture. The integration of artificial intelligence for process control and optimization, together with life cycle assessment (LCA) for comprehensive sustainability evaluation, is identified as essential for technology scale-up. Key areas of advancement include catalytic upgrading, reactor design refinement, and multi-process integration. Future research should prioritize dynamic LCA modeling, development of coke-resistant catalysts, cross-sector process coupling, and intelligent control architectures to overcome existing technical and economic challenges and facilitate the transition toward sustainable energy infrastructure compatible with global carbon neutrality objectives.
