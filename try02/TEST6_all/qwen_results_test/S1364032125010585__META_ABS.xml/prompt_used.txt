You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances and challenges in biomass thermochemical conversion: From resource utilization to process optimization Biomass thermochemical conversion represents a critical pathway for achieving carbon neutrality and sustainable energy production; however, its large-scale deployment remains constrained by significant technological and economic barriers. This review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, employed rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria and systematically searched the Web of Science database to identify and evaluate relevant studies. Recent developments in pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion are examined with emphasis on conversion methodologies, operating conditions, catalyst systems, and reactor configurations, focusing on process efficiency, product distribution, and environmental performance. Major challenges include the elevated oxygen content of bio-oil, tar generation during gasification, catalyst deactivation, and emission control in combustion processes. Emerging approaches, including microwave-assisted processing and catalytic reforming, have demonstrated improvements in bio-oil quality and hydrogen yield, while chemical looping gasification effectively suppresses tar formation and enables intrinsic carbon capture. The integration of artificial intelligence for process control and optimization, together with life cycle assessment (LCA) for comprehensive sustainability evaluation, is identified as essential for technology scale-up. Key areas of advancement include catalytic upgrading, reactor design refinement, and multi-process integration. Future research should prioritize dynamic LCA modeling, development of coke-resistant catalysts, cross-sector process coupling, and intelligent control architectures to overcome existing technical and economic challenges and facilitate the transition toward sustainable energy infrastructure compatible with global carbon neutrality objectives.
