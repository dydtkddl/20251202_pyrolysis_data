You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermally conductive polybutylene succinate composite filled with Si-O-N-C functionalized silicon carbide fabricated via low-speed melt extrusion In this study, we used a low-speed melt extrusion technique to fabricate a thermally conductive Polybutylene Succinate (PBS) composite, filled with various loading fractions of raw and surface-treated Silicon Carbide (SiC). The successful functionalization of silicon oxynitrocarbide (SiC-SiONC) on the surface of the SiC particles was confirmed via Fourier transmission infrared and X-ray electron spectroscopy. Furthermore, field-emission scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the surface treatment yielded improved interfacial adhesion between the SiC fillers and the PBS matrix which in turn contributed to the enhancement of the thermal conductivity. For the composite with 40 wt% surface-treated SiC particles, we achieved a maximum thermal conductivity of 1.05 W m−1 K−1, which is 400% higher than that of the neat PBS. The thermal conductivity measured in this study was higher than the thermal conductivity estimated from different models. Moreover, the PBS composite exhibited excellent heat dissipation performance during thermal testing.
