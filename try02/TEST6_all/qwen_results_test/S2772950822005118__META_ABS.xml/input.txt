Innovations in the synthesis of graphene nanostructures for bio and gas sensors Sensors play a significant role in modern technologies and devices used in industries, hospitals, healthcare, nanotechnology, astronomy, and meteorology. Sensors based upon nanostructured materials have gained special attention due to their high sensitivity, precision accuracy, and feasibility. This review discusses the fabrication of graphene-based biosensors and gas sensors, which have highly efficient performance. Significant developments in the synthesis routes to fabricate graphene-based materials with improved structural and surface properties have boosted their utilization in sensing applications. The higher surface area, better conductivity, tunable structure, and atom-thick morphology of these hybrid materials have made them highly desirable for the fabrication of flexible and stable sensors. Many publications have reported various modification approaches to improve the selectivity of these materials. In the current work, a compact and informative review focusing on the most recent developments in graphene-based biosensors and gas sensors has been designed and delivered. The research community has provided a complete critical analysis of the most robust case studies from the latest fabrication routes to the most complex challenges. Some significant ideas and solutions have been proposed to overcome the limitations regarding the field of biosensors and hazardous gas sensors.
