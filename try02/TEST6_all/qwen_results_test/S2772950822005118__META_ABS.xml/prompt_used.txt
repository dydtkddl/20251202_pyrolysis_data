You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Innovations in the synthesis of graphene nanostructures for bio and gas sensors Sensors play a significant role in modern technologies and devices used in industries, hospitals, healthcare, nanotechnology, astronomy, and meteorology. Sensors based upon nanostructured materials have gained special attention due to their high sensitivity, precision accuracy, and feasibility. This review discusses the fabrication of graphene-based biosensors and gas sensors, which have highly efficient performance. Significant developments in the synthesis routes to fabricate graphene-based materials with improved structural and surface properties have boosted their utilization in sensing applications. The higher surface area, better conductivity, tunable structure, and atom-thick morphology of these hybrid materials have made them highly desirable for the fabrication of flexible and stable sensors. Many publications have reported various modification approaches to improve the selectivity of these materials. In the current work, a compact and informative review focusing on the most recent developments in graphene-based biosensors and gas sensors has been designed and delivered. The research community has provided a complete critical analysis of the most robust case studies from the latest fabrication routes to the most complex challenges. Some significant ideas and solutions have been proposed to overcome the limitations regarding the field of biosensors and hazardous gas sensors.
