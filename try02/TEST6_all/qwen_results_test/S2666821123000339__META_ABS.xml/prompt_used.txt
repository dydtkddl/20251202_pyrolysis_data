You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste tires based biorefinery for biofuels and value-added materials production Waste tires are a distinct type of waste material that is produced in large quantities. These tires present a significant environmental challenge due to their high toxicity and flammability, as well as their persistence and the difficulty of storing or processing them. Every year, approximately 1.4 billion waste tires are produced, and they typically end up either in landfills or being incinerated, exacerbating these environmental problems. However, waste tires are also a promising source of energy and energetic materials, thanks to their low moisture content, heterogeneous nature, and high heating value. Waste tires are comprised of various materials, including carbon black, fabric, filler, antioxidants, natural rubber, and steel wire, all in different compositions. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the various methods for converting waste tires into biofuels, green chemicals, and innovative materials for energy and environmental applications. The study specifically includes a bibliometric analysis to examine the current research trends, identify knowledge gaps, and explore prospects for waste tire biorefinery. Additionally, a comparative assessment of various traditional strategies for managing waste tires is discussed. The study proposes a new integrated waste tire biorefinery that incorporates multiple methods for the valorization of waste tires, including alternative pathways for integrating thermochemical and biological processes. Bibliometric analysis shows that the frequently used keywords in waste tire-related research include pyrolysis, crumb rubber, recycling, combustion, and activated carbon.
