You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Accurate carbon structure for prediction of reaction pathway during bio-coal production using torrefaction The structural parameters of carbon were accurately determined through correction by employing a linear correlation method. Further, the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) was reduced in solid 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra using a solid cross-polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) probe and the total suppression of sidebands sequence (TOSS). The reaction pathway during torrefaction was inferred from analysis of the accurate bond behavior and product distribution. The results show that torrefaction has a significant influence on the structural evolution of biomass. After correction, the relative deviations in the H/C ratio and aromaticity of the carbon structure decreased below 20 %. During torrefaction, the aliphatic carbon bonds were cleaved and aromatic carbon bonds were formed by dehydration, deoxygenation, oligomerization, aromatization, and Diels-Alder reaction. Torrefaction of biomass is divided into three stages. The first stage occurs below 220 °C, with disruption of the hydrogen bonds, a decrease in the number of Cal-O bonds, and the release of some CO2, CO, and furaldehyde. The second stage proceeds in the 220–260 °C range, where β-O-α bonds and glycoside bonds are broken, with the generation of ketones, furan, phenols, CO, and CO2. In the third stage between 260 and 300 °C, Cal-O and Cal-Cal bonds are broken. Bio-coal is composed of monomers of C20H14O3 with two aromatic rings linked by one aromatic ring. This significant, fundamental study enables accurate calculation and simulations for optimizing the industrial utilization of biomass.
