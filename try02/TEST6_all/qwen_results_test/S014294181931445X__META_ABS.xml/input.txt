Biologically and environmentally benign approach for PHB-silver nanocomposite synthesis and its characterization PHB-silver nanocomposite (PHB-AgNc) was synthesized biologically by utilizing a dairy-industry by-product, cheese whey permeate as a substrate for Bacillus megaterium. The single-step synthesis of PHB-AgNc was further confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis. Further, the extracted PHB-Ag Nc was characterized by employing various techniques such as TEM, SEM, FTIR, NMR, Zeta Potential, and DLS analysis. Mechanical properties such as elongation at break, tensile strength, and Young's Modulus were found to be 1.305%, 35.42, and 1.058 N/mm2, respectively. The nanocomposite was found to be stable, polydispersive, and hydrophobic. It exhibited a degradation temperature of 340 °C and portrayed significant antimicrobial resistance against common food pathogens such as E.coli and Pseudomonas spp. Batch fermentation study was carried out for a period of 96 h in a 14 L bioreactor. The highest biomass and nanocomposite yield obtained was 5.8 and 2.4 g/L, respectively. The highest product productivity concerning biomass was found to be 0.012 h−1 at 12 h. The film's migration properties were tested for various food stimulants, and the values obtained were less than the overall migration limit established for food contact materials; hence, the film was found to be appropriate for food packaging applications.
