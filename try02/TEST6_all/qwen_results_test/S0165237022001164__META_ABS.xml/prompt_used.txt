You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Estimation of pyrolysis liquid product yield and its hydrogen content for biomass resources by combined evaluation of pyrolysis conditions with proximate-ultimate analysis data: A machine learning application This study, it was aimed to predict the pyrolysis liquid product yield (Liquid P. Yield (%wt.)) and its hydrogen content (H-oil (%wt.)) based on the biomass composition and pyrolysis conditions. For this purpose, firstly, serial previous studies on biomass pyrolysis in literature were collected in a data set, and the data set used in the study was presented in the Supplementary information document. Then machine learning application was made. Within the scope of the study, Multiple Linear Regression Theory (MLR), Decision Three Theory (DT), Gaussian Model Theory (GM), and Random Forest Theory (RF) were applied to the data set obtained from the literature, and the success rates were compared. As a result, it has been determined that the RF model provides more successful results than other models in predicting the pyrolysis liquid product yield and hydrogen content. In addition, the importance feature information was obtained by using the average pollution reduction method in the whole models of RF. A detailed partial dependency analysis was performed to investigate in-depth the relationship between biomass composition and pyrolysis conditions and target variables. Thus, the amount of liquid product and the hydrogen content (quality) of the liquid product was optimized depending on the biomass composition and pyrolysis conditions. In addition, it was determined that the biomass composition was more effective on the liquid product yield and H-content than the pyrolysis conditions. It is thought that the results and comments of this study will guide the researchers in the process of pyrolysis of different biomass wastes that emerge seasonally and contribute to the more effective evaluation of biomass resources. In addition, The RF model can be used as a good reference for the modeling studies on biomass pyrolysis liquid product distribution and its quality.
