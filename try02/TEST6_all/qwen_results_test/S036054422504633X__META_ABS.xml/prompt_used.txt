You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sewage sludge and olive oil pomace residues as real waste models to feed hydrothermal liquefaction: effect of acid and basic pretreatments We have studied the possibility of using acid and basic pretreatment with HCOOH and KOH to produce high-quality biocrude (BC) from HTL of sewage sludge (SS) and olive oil pomace (OOP) residues as models of waste. Pretreatments are more effective in improving the BC yield and quality obtained from heterogeneous and mixed SS, whereas they are less effective with more homogeneous matrices, such as OOP. In fact, after the HTL of pretreated SS, we obtained higher yields of BC enriched in aliphatic chains with higher values of H/C ratios and energy recovery. In particular, KOH-pretreatment of SS removed oxygen and nitrogen-bearing chemical species from the feedstock and increased the H/C of the BC obtained after HTL from 1.79 to 1.93 at 300 °C and from 1.67 to 1.85 at 350 °C. A notable increase in BC yield and energy recovery was observed with HCOOH-pretreated SS after HTL at 350 °C, attributed to the beneficial impact of acid pretreatment in enhancing the organic content of the matrix. Collected data indicate that HCOOH-pretreatment and proper kinetic severity of HTL allow a densification of chemical energy in the produced BC.
