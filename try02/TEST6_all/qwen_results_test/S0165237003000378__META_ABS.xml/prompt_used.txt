You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal and catalytic cracking of a LDPE–EVA copolymer mixture Catalytic cracking of a plastic mixture consisting of LDPE and ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer (86/14 w/w) over mesoporous Al-SBA-15 and Al-MCM-41 materials as well as nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite (crystal size ∼35 nm) has been carried out in a batch reactor at 400–420°C. The release of acetic acid formed from the EVA decomposition was observed within the temperature range 350–400°C. The most active catalyst was nanometer size HZSM-5 that led to complete conversion of the plastic mixture at 420°C whereas both Al-MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15 were meaningfully less active. In addition, the polymer mixture was more difficult to be cracked both thermally and catalytically than pure LDPE. This result has been ascribed to the occurrence of cross-linking reactions leading to a fast deactivation by coke fouling especially over mesoporous catalysts (Al-MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15) because of their open structure. A high selectivity towards C1–C5 hydrocarbons (∼75%) was attained over nanometer size HZSM-5, most of them being valuable C3–C4 olefins. PIONA analyses of the C6–C12 hydrocarbon fraction obtained at 420°C indicates that olefins were the main components whereas a significant amount of aromatics was also obtained both thermally and catalytically (>15%).
