  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on ultrafiltration polymer composite membranes (PSF/PET) but lacks explicit lab-scale experimental data from a reactor system, relying instead on thermogravimetric analysis and modeling without measurable product yields or reactor-based characterization."
