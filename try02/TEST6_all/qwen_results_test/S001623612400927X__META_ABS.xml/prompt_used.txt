You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behaviour of ultrafiltration polymer composite membranes (PSF/PET): Kinetic, thermodynamic, prediction modelling using artificial neural network and volatile product analysis This study aims to explore the feasibility of managing ultrafiltration polymer composite membranes (UPCM) waste and converting it into valuable chemicals and energy products using a pyrolysis process. The thermal decomposition experiments were performed on polysulfone (PSF)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes using thermogravimetric analysis (TG). The vapors generated during the thermochemical process were analyzed under different heating rate conditions using TG-FTIR and GC/MS. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the pyrolysis process were determined using conventional modeling methods and artificial neural network (ANN) method. The results demonstrated that the PSF/PET feedstock exhibits ahigh volatile matter content (77 % wt.%), which can be completely decomposed up to 600 °C by 79 wt%. While TG-FTIR analysis showed that the released vapors contained aromatic groups and benzoic acid (89.21 wt% at 15˚C/min) as the main GC/MS compound. Moreover, the kinetic analysis demonstrated complete decomposition of the membranes at a lower activation energy (151 kJ/mol). Meanwhile, the ANN model exhibited high performance in predicting the degradation stages of PSF/PET membranes under unknown heating conditions. This approach shows potential for modeling the thermal decomposition of ultrafiltration composite membranes more broadly.
