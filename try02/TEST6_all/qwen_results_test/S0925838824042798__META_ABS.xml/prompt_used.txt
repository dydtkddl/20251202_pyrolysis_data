You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High entropy alloys: A review of preparation techniques, properties and industry applications High entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a novel class of multi-component materials characterized by a paradigm-shifting design that incorporates five or more principal elements in nearly equal proportions. This configuration results in high configurational entropy and the formation of solid solutions. This review succinctly outlines the theoretical foundations of HEAs, including the entropy of the alloy and its thermodynamic stability, following a discussion of design principles and first-principles calculations that are crucial for alloy optimization, we provide a comprehensive review of various preparation techniques, such as mechanical alloying, magnetron sputtering, vacuum smelting, and additive manufacturing, emphasizing their influence on the properties of HEAs. The paper meticulously examines the core effects of these alloys—high entropy, lattice distortion, slow diffusion, and cocktail effects—which contribute to their unique attributes. Additionally, the review explores the promising applications of HEAs in sectors such as aerospace, energy, chemical industries, hydrogen storage, and ocean engineering, highlighting the increasing demand for advanced materials. Looking ahead, we propose future research directions that focus on the interplay between multi-scale structures and properties, interdisciplinary preparation technologies, and sustainable alloy recovery and reuse strategies. This review aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for the rapidly evolving field of high entropy alloys.
