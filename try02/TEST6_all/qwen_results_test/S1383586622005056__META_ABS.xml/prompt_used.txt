You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorptive purification of CO2/H2 gas mixtures of spent disposable wooden chopstick-derived activated carbon: Optimal synthesis condition The production of fossil fuel-based H2 by steam reforming and water–gas shift reactions gives the reformed gas containing both hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). To get pure H2, the CO2 must be removed. In this work, the CO2 was selectively separated from the gas mixture of CO2 and H2 by adsorption process using the spent disposable wooden chopstick (SWC)-derived activated carbon (AC) synthesized by the chemical activation. An appropriate condition for biochar preparation was first explored and then the chemical activation was carried out. Two types of activation chemicals (ZnCl2 and KOH) were employed to activate the biochar at different temperatures (500 – 800 °C). Effects of activation holding time (60 – 150 min) and activation chemical to biochar weight ratio (0.5 – 2.5) were also investigated. The optimal condition for biochar preparation was found at 500 °C and 15 min which can provide the AC yield of 29.5% and CO2 adsorption capacity of 19.2 mg/g from the gas mixtures with 50 mol% CO2 at 25 °C and 1 atm. The AC synthesized by the KOH activation at 700 °C using a KOH/biochar weight ratio of 1.5 for 90 min exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption of 115.7 mg/g for the first use and dropped approximately 20% after 6 adsorption/desorption cycles. Based on the perspective Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation, the best synthesized AC exhibited the selectivity of CO2 adsorption 17.6 times higher than that of H2. The adsorption behavior and kinetic model of CO2 adsorption followed the Freundlich isotherm and the pseudo-2nd order model, respectively and the CO2 adsorption occurred via the combined physical and chemical mechanism.
