You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and kinetic modeling study of styrene combustion The aim of this work is to report new experimental data on styrene combustion and develop a kinetic model for styrene combustion. Three laminar premixed flames of styrene with equivalence ratios of 0.75, 1.00 and 1.70 were studied at low pressure (0.0395atm) using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry. The JSR oxidation of styrene/benzene mixtures with three equivalence ratios of 0.50, 1.00, and 1.50 was studied at atmospheric pressure using gas chromatography. The mole fraction profiles of flame species and oxidation species were measured. A kinetic model of styrene combustion with 290 species and 1786 reactions was developed from our recently reported toluene model, and was validated on the new experimental data from this work and previous ignition delay time data. The O-atom attack reactions, H-atom abstraction reactions and other H-atom attack reactions were found to dominate the consumption of styrene. In particular, the O-atom attack reactions on the double bond of styrene play an important role in the JSR oxidation and the lean and stoichiometric flames, while the pyrolytic reactions have increasing contributions as the equivalence ratio increases. The phenyl radical plays a crucial role in the decomposition of styrene since it affords most of the reaction fluxes from styrene. In the aromatics growth process, phenylacetylene, the 1-phenylvinyl radical, the phenyl radical, and styrene serve as major precursors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), leading to the high sooting tendency of styrene compared to toluene and ethylbenzene.
