Biotechnological potential of spent coffee grounds for biohydrogen production by Escherichia coli The impact of varying initial pH levels of coffee waste hydrolysate on bacterial growth, redox potential changes, and enhanced hydrogen production in 5 L vessels were investigated. Escherichia coli wild-type and septuple mutant (ΔhyaB ΔhybC ΔhycA ΔfdoG ΔldhA ΔfrdC ΔaceE) were used. Bacteria were grown in spent coffee grounds (SCG) medium (40 g L−1 SCG hydrolysed with diluted sulphuric acid) at pH 6.0 to pH 8.0 with addition of 13.6 g L−1 glycerol. In wild type and mutant strain without the presence of glycerol, the cumulative H2 yield was ∼4 L and∼5.3 L, respectively. During glycerol co-fermentation, the cumulative amount of H2 in the wild type was ∼5.2 L, accumulating 0.2 L of H2 per day, while the septuple mutant produced 15 L of H2, accumulating 0.5 L of H2 per day. Thus, H2 gas equal to 33 kWh of energy was produced during batch culturing of 200 g SCG and glycerol.
