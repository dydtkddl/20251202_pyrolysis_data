You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biotechnological potential of spent coffee grounds for biohydrogen production by Escherichia coli The impact of varying initial pH levels of coffee waste hydrolysate on bacterial growth, redox potential changes, and enhanced hydrogen production in 5 L vessels were investigated. Escherichia coli wild-type and septuple mutant (ΔhyaB ΔhybC ΔhycA ΔfdoG ΔldhA ΔfrdC ΔaceE) were used. Bacteria were grown in spent coffee grounds (SCG) medium (40 g L−1 SCG hydrolysed with diluted sulphuric acid) at pH 6.0 to pH 8.0 with addition of 13.6 g L−1 glycerol. In wild type and mutant strain without the presence of glycerol, the cumulative H2 yield was ∼4 L and∼5.3 L, respectively. During glycerol co-fermentation, the cumulative amount of H2 in the wild type was ∼5.2 L, accumulating 0.2 L of H2 per day, while the septuple mutant produced 15 L of H2, accumulating 0.5 L of H2 per day. Thus, H2 gas equal to 33 kWh of energy was produced during batch culturing of 200 g SCG and glycerol.
