You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineering terephthalic acid product from recycling of PET bottles waste for downstream operations Since global oil prices have declined, the price of virgin PET has dropped dramatically, and caused the recycling of PET more challenging. To make the situation worse, the rapid precipitation of terephthalic acid (TPA) from alkaline hydrolysis of PET resulted in very small particles of TPA with unfavorable filtration and drying behaviors. The aim of this work was to engineer product properties of TPA for downstream operations with the existing processing steps. The size effects of TPA crystals/precipitates on filtration, and on drying behaviors, were conducted in terms of specific cake resistance and drying-rate curve, respectively. The whole operating windows was determined for a process optimization by varying operating temperature, feeding strategy, the proportion of water to dimethyl sulfoxide, and the introduction of a cooling operation. Our whole process could be achieved within 8 h at the optimal conditions. As compared to the literature method for chemical recycling of PET, the optimal case exhibited much improved specific cake resistance of ~4.8 × 106 m/g by two orders, and shortened the drying time to 3 h by three times. The TPA crystalline products were also characterized by FTIR for identification, NMR for purity, PXRD for crystallinity, and SEM for particle morphology.
