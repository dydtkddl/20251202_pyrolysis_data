You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of CO2 on the pyrolysis of mixed polymer wastes into combustible fuel: A case study for footwear waste Plastic waste is a promising resource for producing liquid fuels that can be integrated into existing hydrocarbon infrastructures. However, the heterogeneous nature of plastic-derived liquid fuels limits direct application in internal combustion engines, necessitating their refinement into a usable form. To address these issues, this study explored the enhancement of combustible gaseous fuels derived from plastic waste, footwear waste, as a viable alternative. This approach involves the introduction of carbon dioxide as a reactive feedstock during the pyrolysis process. Analytical techniques were employed to precisely determine the types and compositions of four polymers present in footwear waste. The compositional matrices of the primary pyrogenic products were also identified. However, incorporating carbon dioxide into pyrolysis leads to its interaction with volatile compounds, converting them into lighter gaseous products, particularly carbon monoxide. The homogeneous reactivity of carbon dioxide was further enhanced by the application of heat and a nickel-based catalyst. The gaseous product yield from catalytic pyrolysis in the presence of carbon dioxide increased proportionally with the test temperature. Specifically, the use of carbon dioxide led to a 1.92-fold increase in gaseous product yield at 700 ˚C, in reference to the results from nitrogen. This study demonstrates a technical advancement in pyrolytic valorisation of footwear waste by incorporating carbon dioxide and provides a detailed investigation into its mechanical role in maximising the production of combustible gaseous fuels.
