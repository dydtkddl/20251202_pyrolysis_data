You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and modeling study of ammonia borane-based hydrogen storage systems Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) is considered to be a promising hydrogen storage material owing to its very high content of hydrogen (19.6wt%), high stability in air at ambient temperatures and the low temperature of the dehydrogenation process. In this work solid-state decomposition of NH3BH3 in contact with a series of solid materials has been investigated. It was shown that the reactivity of the studied AB-based hydrogen-generating systems was changing under the action of both the chemical nature and thermal conducting properties of the studied modifiers. It is important that, according to ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, the contact of AB with oxygen-containing supports (TiO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, HY zeolite) destabilizes the AB structure to evolve hydrogen already at 80°C, independently of their chemical nature. On the other hand, it was shown that in a heat insulator reaction medium the temperature in the reaction zone increases leading to an increased yield of hydrogen. In addition to this, the reaction properties of AB have for the first time been studied depending on the radius of the tubular reactor during the low-temperature dehydrogenation (90°C) under conditions preventing appearance of local thermal spikes. A mathematical model has been developed which describes the obtained experimental results taking into account the propagation of the reagent-product interface from the heated reactor wall towards its axis.
