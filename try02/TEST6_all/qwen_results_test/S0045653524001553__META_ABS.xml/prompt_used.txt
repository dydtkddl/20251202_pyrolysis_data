You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Developing a sorptive material of cadmium from pyrolysis of hen manure A large amount of manure is generated from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), leading to serious environmental issues and hazardous risks from pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, developing an effective method for manure disposal is essential. Thus, in this study, we suggest the use of CO2 in pyrolysis of hen manure (HM) as an effective method to convert the carbon in HM into syngas (especially carbon monoxide (CO)). HM was used and tested as the model compound. From the results of thermo-gravimetric analysis, the decarboxylation of CaCO3 in HM in the presence of N2 was realized at temperatures ranging from 638 to 754 °C. The Boudouard reaction was observed at ≥ 664 °C in the presence of CO2. Despite the lack of occurrence of the Boudouard reaction, more CO formation was observed in the presence of CO2 at ≥ 460 °C. This was deemed as a homogeneous reaction induced by CO2. Considering the high Ca content of HM, HM biochar in N2 and CO2 were used as adsorbent for removal of Cadmium (Cd), which is toxic heavy metal. The adsorption capacities of HM_N2 and HM_CO2 were 302.4 and 95.7 mg g−1, respectively. The superior performance of HM_N2 is mainly attributed to the presence of Ca(OH)2, which provides favorable (alkaline) conditions for precipitation and ion exchange. Our results indicate the environmental benefits from using CO2. Specifically, CO2 (representative greenhouse gas) converted into fuel. Given this, pyrolysis of HM in the presence of CO2 was achieved at ≤ 640 °C, and the atmospheric condition should be switched from CO2 to N2 at ≥ 640 °C to ensure the decarboxylation of CaCO3.
