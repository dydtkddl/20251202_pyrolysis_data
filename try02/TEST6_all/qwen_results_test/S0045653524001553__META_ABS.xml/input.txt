Developing a sorptive material of cadmium from pyrolysis of hen manure A large amount of manure is generated from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), leading to serious environmental issues and hazardous risks from pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, developing an effective method for manure disposal is essential. Thus, in this study, we suggest the use of CO2 in pyrolysis of hen manure (HM) as an effective method to convert the carbon in HM into syngas (especially carbon monoxide (CO)). HM was used and tested as the model compound. From the results of thermo-gravimetric analysis, the decarboxylation of CaCO3 in HM in the presence of N2 was realized at temperatures ranging from 638 to 754 °C. The Boudouard reaction was observed at ≥ 664 °C in the presence of CO2. Despite the lack of occurrence of the Boudouard reaction, more CO formation was observed in the presence of CO2 at ≥ 460 °C. This was deemed as a homogeneous reaction induced by CO2. Considering the high Ca content of HM, HM biochar in N2 and CO2 were used as adsorbent for removal of Cadmium (Cd), which is toxic heavy metal. The adsorption capacities of HM_N2 and HM_CO2 were 302.4 and 95.7 mg g−1, respectively. The superior performance of HM_N2 is mainly attributed to the presence of Ca(OH)2, which provides favorable (alkaline) conditions for precipitation and ion exchange. Our results indicate the environmental benefits from using CO2. Specifically, CO2 (representative greenhouse gas) converted into fuel. Given this, pyrolysis of HM in the presence of CO2 was achieved at ≤ 640 °C, and the atmospheric condition should be switched from CO2 to N2 at ≥ 640 °C to ensure the decarboxylation of CaCO3.
