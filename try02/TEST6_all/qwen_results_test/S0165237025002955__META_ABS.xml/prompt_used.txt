You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-parameter optimization and predictive modeling of pyrolysis of walnut shells in fixed bed reactor using response surface methodology and machine learning algorithms The present study evaluated the pyrolysis potential of walnut shells, focusing on the impact of key process parameters such as heating rate, temperature, and inert gas flow rate. Additionally, the research involved modeling and optimization of these parameters using hybrid approach that integrates response surface methodology (RSM) with machine learning (ML). The experimental design and optimization were conducted using the face-centered central composite design (FCCD), considering key process parameters such as temperature, heating rate and inert flow rate. This approach aimed to analyze their influence on the yield of bio-oil and bio-char. Integrated approach of RSM (R2 = 0.92) and ML (decision tree, R2 = 0.74) demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy and lower error margins. The optimized conditions were predicted at a temperature of 692.47 °C, a heating rate of 49.93 °C/min, and inert gas flow rate of 238.30 ML/min., resulting a maximum bio-oil yields of 37.57 % and 37.56 % as predicted by RSM and ML modelling, respectively. The combination of RSM with ML, specifically Decision Tree Regression (DT), yielded enhanced predictive accuracy and minimized error margins, demonstrating the robustness of the hybrid modelling approach. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques highlighted that the bio-oil was composed of various organic compounds (e.g., phenols, furans, etc.). Bio-oil derived from walnut shell pyrolysis can be used as an alternative of conventional transportation fuels after some upgradation. The higher heating value of biochar obtained at optimized condition was 24.62 MJ/kg, which can be as used as bio-coal. Among the non-condensable gases generated during pyrolysis, methane and carbon dioxide emerged as the most abundant constituents, comprising approximately 49.40 mol.% and 18.99 mol.%, respectively on nitrogen free basis. The study showed that walnut shells can be effectively valorized through pyrolysis process to produce sustainable bioenergy while reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable resource management.
