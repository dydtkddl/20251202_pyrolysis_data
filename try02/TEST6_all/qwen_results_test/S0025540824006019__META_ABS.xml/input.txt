Low-dimensional transition metal sulfides empower emergent microwave attenuation materials: Nanoarchitectonic, progress, and outlook The implementation of microwave attenuation materials provides the streamlined approach to the elimination of harsh electromagnetic (EM) interferences. However, the impedance matching and attenuation constant of traditional microwave attenuation materials are inferior. Meanwhile, the deep EM responses and attenuation mechanisms have not been fully decrypted at the atomic levels. Low-dimensional transition metal sulfides (TMSs) nanoarchitectonics harboring tunable band-gap and prompt EM responses hold great potential to be engineered as cutting-edge microwave absorbers. Herein, this review begins with the pronounced mechanisms of microwave transmission, and proceeds to introduce the profound attenuation theories. Then, the TMSs are categorized based on the principal groups in which the metal elements are situated. The microwave attenuation characteristics and progress of TMSs nanoarchitectonics are summarized. Finally, the challenges and outlooks of microwave attenuation materials are prospected. Overall, this review provides inspiration on the exploitations of TMSs nanoarchitectonics and next-generation microwave attenuation materials.
