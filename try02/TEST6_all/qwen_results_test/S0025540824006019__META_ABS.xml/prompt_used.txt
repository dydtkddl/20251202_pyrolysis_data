You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-dimensional transition metal sulfides empower emergent microwave attenuation materials: Nanoarchitectonic, progress, and outlook The implementation of microwave attenuation materials provides the streamlined approach to the elimination of harsh electromagnetic (EM) interferences. However, the impedance matching and attenuation constant of traditional microwave attenuation materials are inferior. Meanwhile, the deep EM responses and attenuation mechanisms have not been fully decrypted at the atomic levels. Low-dimensional transition metal sulfides (TMSs) nanoarchitectonics harboring tunable band-gap and prompt EM responses hold great potential to be engineered as cutting-edge microwave absorbers. Herein, this review begins with the pronounced mechanisms of microwave transmission, and proceeds to introduce the profound attenuation theories. Then, the TMSs are categorized based on the principal groups in which the metal elements are situated. The microwave attenuation characteristics and progress of TMSs nanoarchitectonics are summarized. Finally, the challenges and outlooks of microwave attenuation materials are prospected. Overall, this review provides inspiration on the exploitations of TMSs nanoarchitectonics and next-generation microwave attenuation materials.
