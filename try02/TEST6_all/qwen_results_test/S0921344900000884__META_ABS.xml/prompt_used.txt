You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vacuum pyrolysis of automobile shredder residues A research program was undertaken to evaluate the overall performance of a vacuum pyrolysis process applied to the treatment of Automobile Shredder Residues (ASR). North American and European ASR samples were tested. Vacuum pyrolysis experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 496–536°C and a total pressure of approx. 1–5 kPa. Pyrolysis product yields averaged 52.5 wt.% solid residue, 27.7 wt.% organic liquids, 13.3 wt.% pyrolytic water and 6.6 wt.% pyrolysis gas. Composition of ASR feedstocks and pyrolysis products has been thoroughly characterized. After pyrolysis, ASR volume and weight were reduced 5×and 1.8×, respectively. It was possible to readily recover 14 wt.% of useful metals remaining in the solid residues; the material left over can be safely landfilled. Pyrolytic gas and oil can be used as heating fuels. The heavy fraction of the oil (>400°C) can be added to road bitumens in order to improve their performance. The total oil also represents a challenging matrix for various purposes. The vacuum pyrolysis technology can be seen as an alternative to landfill and incineration.
