You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable eco–composites obtained from waste derived biochar: a consideration in performance properties, production costs, and environmental impact Waste based activated biochar was used to manufacture wood/polypropylene biocomposites. The biochar used had no surface functional groups, however, possessed high surface area (335 m2/g). Therefore, it was hypothesised that less than usual amount (3–5 wt%) of compatibiliser (maleic anhydride) could be used, to reduce production costs, while maintaining similar mechanical and flammability properties of the biocomposite. The biocomposites were characterised mechanically through tension, flexural, impact, and micro–hardness tests. The flammability and thermal behaviours were determined using cone calorimetry and thermogravimetry, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy and X–ray diffraction were also employed to comprehend the chemical changes occurring in the biocomposites. It was found that the amount of compatibiliser could be reduced to 1 wt% (from 3 wt%) without compromising on the mechanical performance (especially, tensile strength/modulus, impact strength, and micro–hardness) and flammability properties of the biocomposites. Electron microscopy revealed that the lack of compatibiliser in the biocomposites was compensated by well–dispersed biochar particles whose pores were infiltrated by the polymer causing a mechanical interlocking. In general, addition of biochar improved the mechanical and fire performance of the biocomposites compared to the neat polymer. Reduction of compatibiliser to 1 wt% from 3 wt% in conjunction with biochar saves ∼18% of the biocomposite production costs.
