You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass gasification employing low-temperature carbonization pretreatment for tar reduction Low-temperature carbonization pretreatment for processing solid biomass provides an alternative to the standard use of raw biomass as a gasification feedstock. This low-temperature process is characterized by a comparable heating value, grindability, bulk density, and hydrophobicity to those of the standard. This study investigated the gasification characteristics of biomass carbonized at 300 °C, 350 °C, and 400 °C, and compared them to those of raw biomass from a lab-scale gasification facility with air. Response factors to changes in parameter settings were tested, such as the gasification temperature and the equivalence ratio (ER). The product gas from biomass carbonized at 300 °C had a cold gas efficiency of only 9.9% less than raw biomass and produced 57.8 wt% less tar than raw biomass. It was found that an ER of 0.2 and a gasification temperature of 1,000 °C resulted in the optimum gasification performance for the 300 °C sample. Furthermore, the tar produced from the raw biomass, and the 300 °C sample during 500 °C pyrolysis was analyzed, and it was found that the tar produced from the raw biomass contained 27% higher molecular weight (higher than 301 g/mol), whereas the 300 °C sample contained only a 16% higher molecular weight. It is concluded that low-temperature carbonization pretreatment is effective for both gasification and the reduction of tar byproduct concentration.
