Pyrolysis of brewer’s spent grain: Kinetic study and products identification In this study, the physicochemical properties, the thermal degradation behavior and the products generated from pyrolysis of brewer's spent grain (BSG) were investigated to evaluate the potential of this agro-industrial residue for bio-oil production via pyrolysis. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere. The kinetic parameters were estimated by isoconversional methods and by independent parallel reactions model (IPR). The results showed that the BSG has a good potential for bio-oil production owing to its high volatile matter content and the high heating value. The kinetic behavior was successfully modeled by the IPR model. High added-value compounds were identified from analytical pyrolysis, which indicates that BSG can be a source of important raw materials for the chemical industry.
