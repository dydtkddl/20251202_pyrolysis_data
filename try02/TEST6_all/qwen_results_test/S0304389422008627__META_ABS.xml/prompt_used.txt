You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Crystal-facet and microstructure engineering in ZnO for photocatalytic NO oxidation Photocatalysis is believed to be an important way of reducing NO pollutant in air and the facet engineering of semiconducting oxides could enhance the efficiency of the photocatalysis. ZnO nanoparticles with different exposed crystalline facets were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method and their photocatalytic degradation towards NO was investigated. The crystals from ZnCl2 precursor were hexagonal mesoporous ones with exposed (0002) facet, while those from zinc acetate were in the form of flakes or wheat ears with enhanced exposure of (10 1 ( − ) 1) facet. Calcination in air imparted an enhanced the textural coefficient of the orientated facets as well as the oxygen defects. The nanocrystals with enhanced (0002) facet and lower flat-band energy did better in photoelectrochemical water-oxidation than those with exposed (10 1 ( − ) 1) facet that showed superior photocatalytic activity (approaching 76.7 ± 0.6% under 365 nm photons) for NO oxidation. According to theoretical calculations, (10 1 ( − ) 1) facet with O termination showed much higher affinity to NO molecules than other configurations, and the oxygen vacancy in ZnO played an minor role in the photocatalytic oxidation of NO. A high quantum efficiency approaching 97.5 ± 1.4% under 275 nm photons was obtained for the ZnO crystals from zinc acetate with mixed (0002) and (10 1 ( − ) 1) facets. This research explores the special characteristics of ZnO with different exposed facets and is important for the future design of highly efficient photocatalyst for hazardous material removal.
