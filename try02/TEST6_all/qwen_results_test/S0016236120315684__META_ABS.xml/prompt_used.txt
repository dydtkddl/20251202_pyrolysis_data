You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis product characterization of municipal solid waste using sludge fly ash as additive MSW pyrolysis was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 700 °C and sludge fly ash (SFA) was used as an additive. Only organic fractions of MSW were considered. The yield of the products was compared under three conditions: without SFA, with 5% SFA and with 10% SFA. TG-FTIR was also performed on the single, mixed and SFA fractions of MSW to determine the kinetic parameters of the feedstock. The plastic and rubber fractions were the most useful fractions of MSW. Kinetic analysis showed that addition of SFA resulted in the reduction of the apparent activation energy (E). With SFA pyrolysis, the liquid yield decreased from 20.8% to 6.4% and the gas yield increased from 65.5% to 76.4% with 5% SFA and then, decreased to 73.2% with 10% SFA. The major active species in SFA (CaO, SiO2 and Fe2O3) greatly promoted tar cracking effect, resulting in greater gas and lower liquid yield. Addition of 5% SFA, proved to be the most feasible condition, because of higher H2 yield, lowest char yield and better quality liquid product. Thus, concentration of SFA additive proved to be an important factor in products formation of MSW pyrolysis. The possible ecological risk valuation of heavy metals in chars showed the RI values, with 5% and 10% SFA, as 49.02 and 65.10, respectively. This work demonstrated that addition of sludge fly ash played a vital role in the pyrolysis of MSW.
