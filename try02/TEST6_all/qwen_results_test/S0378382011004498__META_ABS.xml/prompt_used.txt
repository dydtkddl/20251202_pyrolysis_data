You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of a particle model to pyrolysis. Comparison of different feedstock: Plastic, tyre, coal and biomass The thermal behaviour of solid particles of plastic, tyre, coal and biomass as feedstock in pyrolysis processes was studied. The samples were pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyzer in nitrogen atmosphere (surface flow rate 2.65·10−3 m/s) at two different heating rates (5 and 10°C/min) with temperatures ranging from 150 to 950°C. This paper shows the successful application of the distributed energy model to study the effects of dynamic experiments on the solid pyrolysis, in particular, to ABS plastic and tyre rubber for the first time. In addition, the reaction model algorithm used was successfully implemented together with a heat transfer model to predict temperature profiles in the particle and to explore the effects of both solid characteristics and process conditions on the pyrolysis. Within the process conditions studied (particle size, inlet feedstock temperature, reactor temperature and global heat transfer coefficient) the particle size was the most influencing one. From the solid characteristics, the main influence in the particle behaviour was attributed to the characteristic devolatilisation obtained in thermobalance showing the physicochemical properties a weak influence on it.
