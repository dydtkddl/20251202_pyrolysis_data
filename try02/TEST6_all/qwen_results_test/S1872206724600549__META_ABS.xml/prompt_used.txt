You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress on bimetallic catalysts for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass and plastics by hydrodeoxygenation Valorization of biomass and plastics is an urgent assignment to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. Hydrodeoxygenation using bimetallic catalysts with distinct active sites is one of the most effective approaches to producing fuels and chemicals via C–O/C–C bonds hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation. Rational design of bimetallic catalysts has been progressed in recent studies owing to the understanding of synergy and strong mutual interaction between metal nanoparticles and metal oxide species. Thus, activity of bimetallic catalysts has been further improved, and the chemoselectivity for suppression of C–C bond dissociation and the regioselectivity among different C–O bonds, which have less been achieved before, are realized in the hydrodeoxygenation reactions. The catalytic performances, catalyst structures, and reaction mechanisms are directly compared and discussed in details based on the C–O bond cleavage using glycerol and 1,2-propanediol hydrogenolysis as model reactions over Ir-, Pt-, and Ru-based bimetallic catalysts. Finally, application of these bimetallic catalysts to conversion of lignocellulose-derived feedstocks, carbonyl compounds, and typical plastic of polycarbonates is introduced.
