Synthesis, surface modification and photocatalytic property of ZnO nanoparticles ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by calcination of precursor prepared by the precipitation method. Polystyrene was grafted onto the surface of ZnO nanoparticles to improve the dispersion of the particles and to reduce their photocatalytic activity. The obtained particles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The photocatalytic activity of bare and modified ZnO nanoparticles was studied. The influence of surface modification on the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange has been analyzed. The composition of residual solution was determined through high performance liquid chromatography. Experimental results show that well dispersed ZnO nanoparticles were obtained after surface modification. ZnO nanoparticles possess high photocatalytic activity, whereas the photocatalytic activity can be significantly reduced when polystyrene was grafted onto the particle surface.
