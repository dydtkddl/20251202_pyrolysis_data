Non-thermal external field-driven synthesis and performance modulation of high-density hydrogen storage materials Solid-state hydrogen storage materials (HSM) have attracted significant attention due to their high volumetric hydrogen density and enhanced safety. However, de/hydrogenation reactions processes of HSM are primarily governed by thermal energy, where heat exchange serves as the fundamental driving force for the reversible hydrogen storage. While conventional thermal driving methods are effective for certain metal hydrides, they demonstrate limited driving efficiency when applied to lightweight high-density HSMs with strong chemical bonds and high stability, such as Mg-based HSMs, complex HSMs and lightweight metal hydride. In contrast, emerging non-thermal energy input strategies like external field-driven techniques (e.g., plasma, ultrasonic, microwave, light, and electric fields) have demonstrated innovative potential beyond traditional thermal activation for HSMs. These advanced techniques not only facilitate material synthesis but also significantly reduce operating temperatures for de-/hydrogenation while enhancing reaction kinetics, thereby allowing precise control over hydrogen storage behaviors. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in non-thermal input external field-driven material synthesis and de-/hydrogenation behavior modulation of high-density HSMs, provides in-depth discussions on the underlying enhancement mechanisms, respective advantages/limitations, material/functional applicability, and near-term feasibility as well as long-term implications of these non-thermal external fields, and outlines future optimization strategies and potential scalable applications for next-generation HSMs.
