A sensitive electrochemical immunosensor developed by in situ catalyzed and deposited copper on carbon-dot arrays contained in a Zn-MOF In this work, a highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor was constructed through using the metal organic-framework (Zn-MOF) as a template to synthesize the carbon-dot arrays (CDs@Zn-MOFs), and combining with the in situ copper deposition for amplification the electrochemical response signal. The Zn-MOFs are first synthesized by using Zn2+ and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylicacid (H3BTC) at 120 °C for 72 h. After the glucose (Glu) precursors have infiltrated the pores of the as-prepared Zn-MOFs, the Glu-loaded Zn-MOFs (Glu@Zn-MOFs) are heated at 200 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h, yielding well-defined CD arrays (CDs@Zn-MOFs). Starting from the ultrasmall and uniform-size CDs with polyhydroxy structure, copper ions will be absorbed on the surface of CD arrays, which will be reduced with the ascorbic acid (AA) to generate abundant copper deposition onto CDs@Zn-MOFs. As a result, corresponding electrochemical currents are produced owing to the copper oxidation in appropriate electrolytes. Thus, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) as model targets, the fabricated electrochemical immunosensor using CDs@Zn-MOF as a label displayed good sensitivity with detection limits of 250.0 fg mL−1 for SARS-CoV-2 and 63.1 pg mL−1 for IgG, respectively. The currently proposed sensing strategy demonstrates several distinct advantages, including a simple operation process and relatively low temperature for producing CD arrays, substantial amplification strategy of copper deposition reaction, and easily accessible electrochemical responses. Therefore, this outstanding performance of the proposed sensing strategy highlights the promising application in bioassay.
