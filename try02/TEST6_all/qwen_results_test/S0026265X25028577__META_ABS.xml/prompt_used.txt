You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A sensitive electrochemical immunosensor developed by in situ catalyzed and deposited copper on carbon-dot arrays contained in a Zn-MOF In this work, a highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor was constructed through using the metal organic-framework (Zn-MOF) as a template to synthesize the carbon-dot arrays (CDs@Zn-MOFs), and combining with the in situ copper deposition for amplification the electrochemical response signal. The Zn-MOFs are first synthesized by using Zn2+ and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylicacid (H3BTC) at 120 °C for 72 h. After the glucose (Glu) precursors have infiltrated the pores of the as-prepared Zn-MOFs, the Glu-loaded Zn-MOFs (Glu@Zn-MOFs) are heated at 200 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h, yielding well-defined CD arrays (CDs@Zn-MOFs). Starting from the ultrasmall and uniform-size CDs with polyhydroxy structure, copper ions will be absorbed on the surface of CD arrays, which will be reduced with the ascorbic acid (AA) to generate abundant copper deposition onto CDs@Zn-MOFs. As a result, corresponding electrochemical currents are produced owing to the copper oxidation in appropriate electrolytes. Thus, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) as model targets, the fabricated electrochemical immunosensor using CDs@Zn-MOF as a label displayed good sensitivity with detection limits of 250.0 fg mL−1 for SARS-CoV-2 and 63.1 pg mL−1 for IgG, respectively. The currently proposed sensing strategy demonstrates several distinct advantages, including a simple operation process and relatively low temperature for producing CD arrays, substantial amplification strategy of copper deposition reaction, and easily accessible electrochemical responses. Therefore, this outstanding performance of the proposed sensing strategy highlights the promising application in bioassay.
