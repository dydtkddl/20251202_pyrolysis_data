Subcritical water extraction enhancement by adding deep eutectic solvent for extracting xanthone from mangosteen pericarps Enhanced extraction of phenolic compounds from pericarps of mangosteen by subcritical water treatment was performed at various temperatures and pressures of 120–160°C and 1–10MPa in batch and semi–batch systems. Instead of water, the deionized water which contains deep eutectic solvent at 10–30% volume was used as an extraction media. With 30% of deep eutectic solvent addition, the yields of xanthone and phenolic compounds content were 24.87mg/g dried sample and 179.54mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dried sample at extraction temperatures of 160 and 120°C in batch system, respectively. They could achieve to 27.15mg/g dried sample and 372.69mg of GAE/g dried sample when the extraction were performed in semi–batch system at temperature of 160°C and pressures of 5 and 10MPa with 10 and 30% of deep eutectic solvent addition, respectively.
