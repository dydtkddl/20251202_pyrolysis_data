You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-production of carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from waste plastic gasification in a two-stage fluidized catalytic bed This study aims to develop a two-stage fluidized catalytic bed reactor system for continuous co-production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen from waste plastics gasification. Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 catalysts have been synthesized and granulated for CNTs synthesis and hydrogen production in the first- and second-stage reactor, respectively. The operating parameters, including reaction temperature and equivalence ratio (ER), were investigated to confirm the feasibility for CNTs and hydrogen production of this system. The Ni/Al-SBA-15 added in the first-stage reactor enhanced the waste plastics degradation to produce CH4 and C2–C5 hydrocarbons with increasing temperature, which could be used as the source for CNTs synthesis. Lowering the ER promoted the catalytic thermal cracking and reforming of hydrocarbons that contributed to the CNTs and hydrogen production. Nevertheless, the H2 production rate showed a significant increase to 857.6 mmol/h-g catalyst with the assistance of Ni–Cu/CaO–SiO2 in the second-stage reactor. The produced smaller-molecule hydrocarbons from the second-stage reactor with higher temperatures could benefit the co-production of CNTs and hydrogen. The two-stage fluidized catalytic bed gasification system exhibited an optimal performance of high fraction CNTs and H2 when temperatures of first- and second-stage reactor were controlled at 600 and 800 °C, respectively, with 0.1 ER.
