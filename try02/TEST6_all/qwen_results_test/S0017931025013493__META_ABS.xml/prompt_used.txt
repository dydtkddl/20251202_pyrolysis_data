You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A GPU-based CFD-DEM approach for modelling of complex gas-solid flow with heat transfer This paper developed a high-performance GPU-based CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) model to simulate complex gas-solid flow with heat transfer. The model is compatible with a variety of mesh types in the CFD solver and can handle arbitrary boundaries in the DEM solver, enabling the simulation of industrial systems with numerous particles and complex geometries. The model is validated against two experiments in a spout bed and bubbling cooling fluidized bed, and its efficiency is benchmarked against previous simulations. The results show that this new model is able to speed up the simulation by an 18.6-fold speedup in the CFD solver and a 6.1-fold speedup in the GPU-based DEM solver, compared to the previous studies that use GPU-based DEM solvers in a large-scale fluidized bed. Further, the simulation time is increased by only 16% as the particle number increases by 4 times - from 1.3 million to 5.3 million. The high-performance model is then employed to simulate a cooling fluidized bed with 5.0 million particles and the multiple blast furnace raceways with 10 million particles, demonstrating its capability to efficiently handle both simple and complex geometries with huge particle numbers. This robust CFD-DEM model framework presents a cost-effective tool for simulating complex gas-solid systems with heat transfer in industrial applications.
