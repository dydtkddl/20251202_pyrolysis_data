A GPU-based CFD-DEM approach for modelling of complex gas-solid flow with heat transfer This paper developed a high-performance GPU-based CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) model to simulate complex gas-solid flow with heat transfer. The model is compatible with a variety of mesh types in the CFD solver and can handle arbitrary boundaries in the DEM solver, enabling the simulation of industrial systems with numerous particles and complex geometries. The model is validated against two experiments in a spout bed and bubbling cooling fluidized bed, and its efficiency is benchmarked against previous simulations. The results show that this new model is able to speed up the simulation by an 18.6-fold speedup in the CFD solver and a 6.1-fold speedup in the GPU-based DEM solver, compared to the previous studies that use GPU-based DEM solvers in a large-scale fluidized bed. Further, the simulation time is increased by only 16% as the particle number increases by 4 times - from 1.3 million to 5.3 million. The high-performance model is then employed to simulate a cooling fluidized bed with 5.0 million particles and the multiple blast furnace raceways with 10 million particles, demonstrating its capability to efficiently handle both simple and complex geometries with huge particle numbers. This robust CFD-DEM model framework presents a cost-effective tool for simulating complex gas-solid systems with heat transfer in industrial applications.
