You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photothermal nano-confinement reactor with bimetallic sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate activation in antibiotic degradation In recent years, photothermal-assisted Fenton-like degradation of organic pollutants has become a prominent green method in environmental pollution control. Nevertheless, the design of suitable catalysts remains a significant challenge for this approach. Herein, zeolite-imidazolate framework-derived CoMn bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in hollow carbon nanofibers (CoMnHCF) have been developed as a photothermal nano-confinement reactor with multiple active sites to enhance reaction performance and promote peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Under light irradiation, the local temperature within the porous spaces of CoMnHCF was significantly higher than the liquid temperature. The confined space concentrated heat, minimized thermal loss, and effectively utilizes this feature to activate PMS for antibiotic degradation. The results demonstrated that this system efficiently degraded various antibiotics, including tetracycline hydrochloride, levofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and chlorotetracycline. Photothermal contribution analysis revealed that thermal effects predominate in this system. Further DFT simulations explored the coordination environment of metal elements and the properties of related pollutants, predicting potential structures and reaction sites. A series of water quality experiments and cyclic tests demonstrated the system's significant application potential. This study offered new insights into advancing the integrated use of photothermal conversion and nano-confinement reactor activation of PMS in sewage purification.
