Photothermal nano-confinement reactor with bimetallic sites for enhanced peroxymonosulfate activation in antibiotic degradation In recent years, photothermal-assisted Fenton-like degradation of organic pollutants has become a prominent green method in environmental pollution control. Nevertheless, the design of suitable catalysts remains a significant challenge for this approach. Herein, zeolite-imidazolate framework-derived CoMn bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in hollow carbon nanofibers (CoMnHCF) have been developed as a photothermal nano-confinement reactor with multiple active sites to enhance reaction performance and promote peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Under light irradiation, the local temperature within the porous spaces of CoMnHCF was significantly higher than the liquid temperature. The confined space concentrated heat, minimized thermal loss, and effectively utilizes this feature to activate PMS for antibiotic degradation. The results demonstrated that this system efficiently degraded various antibiotics, including tetracycline hydrochloride, levofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and chlorotetracycline. Photothermal contribution analysis revealed that thermal effects predominate in this system. Further DFT simulations explored the coordination environment of metal elements and the properties of related pollutants, predicting potential structures and reaction sites. A series of water quality experiments and cyclic tests demonstrated the system's significant application potential. This study offered new insights into advancing the integrated use of photothermal conversion and nano-confinement reactor activation of PMS in sewage purification.
