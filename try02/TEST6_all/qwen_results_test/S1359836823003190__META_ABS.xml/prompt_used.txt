You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interfacial architecting of long-acting hyperbranched flame retardant with high efficiency towards smoke-suppressed flexible polyurethane foam The incorporation of flame retardants (FRs) is often applied to reduce the fire risk of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF), however, the addition of FRs usually brings mechanical loss, and the emigration of FRs during service life results in a decrease in flame retardancy. In this work, a hyperbranched FR (HPNP) containing nitrogen and phosphorous was synthesized via transesterification between dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) and triethanolamine. The distribution of HNPN in FPUF was simulated by the Materials Studio software. The flammability was characterized by the open flame test, horizontal combustion test, limiting oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimeter test. The FPUF sample containing only 4 wt% HPNP self-extinguished immediately after the removal of the ignitor. For the FPUF containing 8 wt% HPNP sample, the LOI was increased to 26.3% from 17.9%. The total heat release and total smoke production were reduced by 65% and 75%, respectively compared to that of the control FPUF sample. More importantly, the radical trapping action in the gas phase and the charring promotion in the condensed phase were simulated and verified based on the experimental data. Furthermore, the interfacial energy calculation and molecular dynamics simulation suggested that the improved compatibility of FPUF/HPNP resulted in the superior durability of HPNP in FPUF. In addition, the FPUF samples containing HPNP also showed enhanced mechanical properties. It was expected the hyperbranched HPNP would be an ideal additive to produce flame retardant FPUF with excellent comprehensive performance.
