You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Decomposition of high-impact polystyrene resin in e-waste by supercritical water oxidation process with debromination of decabromodiphenyl ethane and recovery of antimony trioxide simultaneously In order to ensure the performance and safety of electronic products, a large number of polymeric insulation resins are used as housing materials. When electronic products are discarded as e-waste, these resins containing organobromine compounds and antimony trioxide as flame retardants are difficult to be disposed of by traditional recycling methods, due to their excellent resistance to acid, alkali, high temperature and photooxidation. It not only brings the hazardous risks for environmental protection, but also hinders the recovery of resources in e-waste. In this study, supercritical water oxidation(SCWO) process was applied to decompose waste high-impact polystyrene(HIPS) resin in e-waste combining debromination of decabromodiphenyl ethane and recovery of antimony trioxide. The results showed that HIPS could be quickly and efficiently decomposed during SCWO process. The optimum SCWO parameters were temperature of 500 ℃, holding time of 60 min, pressure of 23 MPa, and excess oxygen of 200 %, respectively. The decomposition products of HIPS were hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water. Meanwhile, brominated flame retardants and antimony trioxide added to the HIPS were also debrominated and recovered. Without secondary pollution, the SCWO process developed in this study could effectively achieve decomposition of HIPS resins, debromination of brominated flame retardants and recovery of antimony trioxide in one procedure.
