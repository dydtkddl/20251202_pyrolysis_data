You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fuel production from waste polystyrene via pyrolysis: Kinetics and products distribution In the present study polystyrene waste (PS) was collected from a drop off site in a local market and pyrolyzed at heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min and temperature range 40–600 °C under nitrogen condition. The apparent activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) were determined using 6 different kinetic methods. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor were found in the range of 82.3 – 202.8 kJmol−1 and 3.5 × 106–7.6 × 1014 min−1 respectively. The results demonstrated that the calculated values of Ea and A vary with fraction of conversion, heating rates and the applied model. Moreover, pyrolysis of waste polystyrene was carried out in an indigenously manufactured furnace at temperatures ranging from 340 to 420 °C. The composition of liquid and gaseous fractions was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Temperature and reaction time were optimized and the results revealed that temperature of 410 °C and exposure time of 70 min are the best conditions for maximum fuel oil production. Methane and ethane were found as the main products in the gas phase constituting about 82% of the gaseous fraction. The liquid products composed of broad range of C2 – C15 hydrocarbons depending on the pyrolytic parameters. A comparison of the composition of pyrolysis oil with standard parameters of diesel, gasoline and kerosene oil suggested that pyrolysis oil from polystyrene waste holds great promise for replacing fuel oil.
