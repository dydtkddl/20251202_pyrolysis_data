Co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and polypropylene: A route to improved biofuel from mixed waste streams This study explores the use of thermochemical co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and waste cooking oil as a sustainable pathway for converting plastic and lipid-based residues into liquid biofuels. Comprehensive characterisation is performed using thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess decomposition behaviour, product yields, and chemical composition across varying feedstock blend ratios. The addition of waste cooking oil is found to significantly reduce the initial decomposition temperature from 396 °C (pure waste polypropylene) to 315 °C, and to enhance the liquid yield, reaching a maximum of 70.00 % at a 1:1 blend ratio of the two feedstocks. Chemical analysis reveals a progressive increase in oxygenated functional groups and a shift toward longer-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C13–C18) with an increase in the content of waste cooking oil, features associated with improved combustion potential and fuel quality. Particulate matter analysis reveals notable variations in particle size distribution and concentration, with waste polypropylene alone generating predominantly ultrafine particles in the 3–30 nm range. In contrast, higher proportions of waste cooking oil and increased thermal load are found to shift the particle sizes toward the 20–40 nm range. These results indicate that the co-pyrolysis of plastic and cooking oil waste not only enables efficient waste valorisation but also produces bio-based liquid fuels with favourable chemical and emission-related properties. The findings support the development of integrated waste-to-energy strategies that are aligned with the concept of the circular economy and sustainable bioenergy goals.
