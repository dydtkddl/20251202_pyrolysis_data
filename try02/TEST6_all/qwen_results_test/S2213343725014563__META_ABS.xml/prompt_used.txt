You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Functionalization of polymers and nanomaterials for H2/CO2 separation membrane: State-of-the-art, challenges and perspectives Membrane technology provides unique advantages in separating hydrogen from various mixture streams in commercial settings owing to its energy efficiency and small footprints. Conventional polymer membranes have low permeability and selectivity in H2/CO2 separation, which limits their commercial application. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) which combine the advantages of conventional polymeric materials and inorganic nanomaterials offer tremendous opportunities to surmount the shortcomings and unsatisfactory performances of the polymeric and inorganic counterparts. While delivering attractive features to improve the permeability, selectivity, and durability of the membranes, the insufficient performance improvement of MMMs is closely associated with some bottlenecks, particularly the presence of interface defects caused by poor dispersion and incompatibility with the polymer. Various functionalization strategies have been explored to address these issues. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the functionalization strategies of polymeric membranes and MMMs for hydrogen separation, including their advantages and limitations, the classification of functionalization and the effects of functionalization on performance is presented. The current technical challenges are highlighted and the insights into future research directions are discussed. The progress made in membrane functionalization not only addresses the current limitations but also paves the way for a sustainable and efficient hydrogen economy.
