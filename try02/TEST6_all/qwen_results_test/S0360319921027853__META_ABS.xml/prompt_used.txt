You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen sorption behavior of mechanically synthesized Mg–Ag alloys A systematic study of the interactions between hydrogen and Mg–Ag alloys prepared by mechanical alloying is presented in this paper. The alloys were chosen to cover both the two-phase limited solubility and hypoeutectic regions (3, 5, 10, 20 wt. % Ag in Mg) as well as the intermetallic phases (γ′-AgMg4, ε-AgMg3 and AgMg). The hydrogen-absorption abilities of the samples were investigated for the two states: directly after mechanical alloying and after annealing. It was found that all of the chosen alloys could be very effectively synthesized with mechanical alloying, a process that also was found to extend the solubility limits compared to those on known phase diagrams. The synthesis is greatly enhanced by further annealing which allows us to obtain well crystallized samples with phase compositions in accordance with these phase diagrams. In most cases, the obtained alloys were able to absorb significant amounts of hydrogen while magnesium hydride and AgMg intermetallics were formed as a residual product and phase, respectively, that did not react with hydrogen under the chosen conditions. The magnesium hydride formed in such reactions seemed to have a very similar decomposition temperature and was not significantly influenced by the silver additive, which was not found to greatly catalyze the MgH2 decomposition reaction in such cases. Samples characterized directly after ball milling showed higher reaction kinetics with hydrogen.
