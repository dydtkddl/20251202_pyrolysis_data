You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A molecular dynamics simulation study on the co-pyrolysis reaction mechanism of anisole blended with ammonia To investigate the pyrolysis of pure anisole (C6H5OCH3) and the effect of adding ammonia (NH3) on its pyrolysis process. First, based on the anisole pyrolysis mechanism proposed by Wagnon et al., simulations are carried out in the Jet-stirred reactor under the experimental conditions (850–1160 K) of Yuan et al., and the results are compared with their experimental data. On this basis, the pyrolysis of pure anisole in 2000–2900 K and the pyrolysis process of pure anisole mixed with different proportions of ammonia (5–40 wt%) are further studied by using molecular dynamics simulation. The initial pyrolysis of pure anisole molecules is mainly carried out through the following three reactions: R1: C6H5OCH3 → C6H5O + CH3; R2: C6H5OCH3 → C6H5 + OCH3; R3: C6H5OCH3 → C6H5OCH2 + H. In the kinetic model at 1160 K, anisole pyrolysis has only R1 pathway. The phenoxy radicals generated by the initial pyrolysis form C2H2 and other small olefin products through the C6H5O → C5H5 → C2H2 and C6H5O → C6H4 → C2H2 pathways. The addition of NH3 makes the anisole molecule completely pyrolyzed within 250 ps and increases the proportion of R2 in the whole pyrolysis reaction. Anisole molecule has strong π-π interaction due to the existence of benzene ring, while NH3 molecules mainly have hydrogen bond and van der Waals force, which makes it difficult to react directly. The interaction reaction pathways after adding NH3 are mainly as follows: Step 1: NH3 → NH2 + H, C6H5OCH3 → C6H5O + CH3; Step 2: C6H5O + NH2 → C6H5ONH2; Step 3: C6H5ONH2 → H2NO → HNO → NO, C6H5ONH2 → H2NO → H2. The increase of the mass fraction of NH3 promotes the formation of H2, H2O, especially nitrogen oxide NO. Among all the pathways of NO production, reactions HNO + H → NO + H2 and HNO → NO + H are the most important. With the increase of NH3 content, the consumption rate of N2 accelerates. The activation energy before (46.66 kcal/mol) and after (60.08, 52.49, 65.64, and 67.37 kcal/mol) NH3 mixing is compared. The addition of NH3 increased the activation energy of the pyrolysis of anisole molecules. However, high temperature promoted the formation of more NH2 radicals and improved the consumption efficiency of anisole.
