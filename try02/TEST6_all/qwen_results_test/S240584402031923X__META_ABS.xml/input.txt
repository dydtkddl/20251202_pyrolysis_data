Catalytic assessment of solid materials for the pyrolytic conversion of low-density polyethylene into fuels Pyrolysis techniques provide an interesting way of recycling plastic wastes (PW) by transforming them into liquid fuels with high calorific values. Catalysts are employed in PW pyrolysis in order to favor cracking reactions; in that regard, cheap and abundant natural resources are being investigated as potential catalyst precursors. This article explores the pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a semibatch reactor under a reduced pressure of 300 torr and temperatures in the range of 370 °C–430 °C. Three different solid materials, an activated carbon (AC1), a commercial Fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) and an aluminum- pillared clay (Al-PILC), were tested as catalysts for the pyrolysis process. Thermogravimetric analyzes were previously performed to select the most catalytically active materials. AC1 displayed very low catalytic activity while FCC and Al-PILC displayed high activity and conversion to liquid products. Hydrocarbons ranging from C5 to C28 were identified in the liquid products as well as significant changes in their composition when FCC and Al-PILC catalyst were used. Differences in the catalytic activity of the 3 solid materials are ascribed mainly to differences in their acid properties.
