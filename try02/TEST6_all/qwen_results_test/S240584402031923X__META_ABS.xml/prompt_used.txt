You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic assessment of solid materials for the pyrolytic conversion of low-density polyethylene into fuels Pyrolysis techniques provide an interesting way of recycling plastic wastes (PW) by transforming them into liquid fuels with high calorific values. Catalysts are employed in PW pyrolysis in order to favor cracking reactions; in that regard, cheap and abundant natural resources are being investigated as potential catalyst precursors. This article explores the pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a semibatch reactor under a reduced pressure of 300 torr and temperatures in the range of 370 °C–430 °C. Three different solid materials, an activated carbon (AC1), a commercial Fluid cracking catalyst (FCC) and an aluminum- pillared clay (Al-PILC), were tested as catalysts for the pyrolysis process. Thermogravimetric analyzes were previously performed to select the most catalytically active materials. AC1 displayed very low catalytic activity while FCC and Al-PILC displayed high activity and conversion to liquid products. Hydrocarbons ranging from C5 to C28 were identified in the liquid products as well as significant changes in their composition when FCC and Al-PILC catalyst were used. Differences in the catalytic activity of the 3 solid materials are ascribed mainly to differences in their acid properties.
