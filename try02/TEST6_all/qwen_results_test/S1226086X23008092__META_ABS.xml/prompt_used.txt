You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An overview of synthesis, morphology, and versatile applications of nanostructured graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) Nanostructured graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has garnered significant attention due to its unique properties arising from the quantum size effect in nanoparticles. These properties include magnetism, optics, acoustics, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and superconductivity. Tailored morphologies, such as nanotubes and ultrathin nanosheets, exhibit enhanced characteristics like increased band gap values, efficient charge separation, and substantial specific surface areas. These features make g-C3N4 promising for applications in diverse fields, including photocatalysis, electronics, energy storage, and biotechnology. The synthesis of g-C3N4 in nanoscale forms is of particular interest, offering higher surface areas, abundant active sites, improved water dispersibility, and a wider band gap. Various nanoarchitectures of g-C3N4, including nanosheets, nanotubes, nanorods, quantum dots, nano-spherical frameworks, and nanocomposites, have been explored. Scientists employ top-down approaches inspired by graphene extraction and bottom-up methods like templating to manipulate the structure. Nanostructured g-C3N4′s nontoxic nature, high stability, and cost-effective synthesis further contribute to its increasing interest, especially in energy and environmental applications. Moreover, nanostructured g-C3N4 has emerged as a potential two-dimensional nanomaterial with intrinsic features that cater specifically to various applications. Additionally, it can be utilized in the development of advanced nanomaterials, which offer additional advantages through their synergistic attachment or binding to specific targets of interest.
