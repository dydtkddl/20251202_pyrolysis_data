You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

HCl formation mechanism in the pyrolysis process of coal mine conveyor belt To investigate the pyrolysis characteristics of a coal mine conveyor belt and the formation mechanism of HCl during the pyrolysis process, Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-DSC-FTIR-MS) and pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) techniques were employed. These methods were used to analyze the pyrolysis behavior of the conveyor belt material at various temperatures and to observe the evolution of its microscopic chemical groups. The results demonstrate that the pyrolysis process of a conveyor belt is separated into four stages. The chlorine-containing compounds in pyrolysis products are predominantly found in phosphate esters, aromatic esters, and aliphatic molecules. These compounds first increase with rising temperature, then decline with increasing temperature, reaching the peak area content of 1.35 %. Based on the generation of chlorine-containing compounds, it is obtained that the pyrolysis process of hydrochloric acid in coal mine conveyor belts is mainly caused by the free radical mechanism of the polyvinyl chloride component and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate breaks, which produces a series of reactions such as dehydrochlorination. This reaction mainly occurs in the first stage (200 ∼ 350 ℃), and the characteristic gas HCl production reaches its maximum value in the first stage.
