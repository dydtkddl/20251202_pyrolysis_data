HCl formation mechanism in the pyrolysis process of coal mine conveyor belt To investigate the pyrolysis characteristics of a coal mine conveyor belt and the formation mechanism of HCl during the pyrolysis process, Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-DSC-FTIR-MS) and pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) techniques were employed. These methods were used to analyze the pyrolysis behavior of the conveyor belt material at various temperatures and to observe the evolution of its microscopic chemical groups. The results demonstrate that the pyrolysis process of a conveyor belt is separated into four stages. The chlorine-containing compounds in pyrolysis products are predominantly found in phosphate esters, aromatic esters, and aliphatic molecules. These compounds first increase with rising temperature, then decline with increasing temperature, reaching the peak area content of 1.35 %. Based on the generation of chlorine-containing compounds, it is obtained that the pyrolysis process of hydrochloric acid in coal mine conveyor belts is mainly caused by the free radical mechanism of the polyvinyl chloride component and tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate breaks, which produces a series of reactions such as dehydrochlorination. This reaction mainly occurs in the first stage (200 ∼ 350 ℃), and the characteristic gas HCl production reaches its maximum value in the first stage.
