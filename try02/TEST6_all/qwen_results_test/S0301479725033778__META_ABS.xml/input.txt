Enhancing the degradation of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate microplastics in water using electrochemical treatment at neutral pH Microplastic (MP) pollution is a growing global concern, with polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) posing significant environmental risks due to their toxicity. However, limited research has focused on their degradation. This study investigated the electro-oxidation (EO) of PS and PET MPs in a synthetic solution prepared with deionized water, using a BDD anode. The reaction was conducted in an electrochemical batch reactor. Key operating parameters, including current intensity, initial MPs concentration, electrolyte concentration, and anode surface area, were evaluated. The EO process achieved 96 ± 3 % and 81 ± 3 % degradation of PS and PET within 10 and 12 h, respectively. While all parameters influenced degradation efficiency, anode surface area primarily affected energy consumption. Structural, morphological, and elemental analyses using FTIR, SEM, and CHNSO confirmed polymer degradation, while gas chromatography verified CO2 as the final oxidation product. Experimental analyses provided valuable insights into the degradation pathways. The degradation process of PS and PET MPs was 67 % and 58 %, more cost-efficient compared to the reported EO method using BDD/Ti. These findings highlight EO as a promising and effective method for MPs removal from water without generating harmful by-products.
