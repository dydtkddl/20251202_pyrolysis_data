You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and characterization of the porous activated carbon from end-of-life tire pyrolysis for CO2 sequestration This research aims to synthesize and characterize the CO2 adsor+bent from waste tire (WT) as a precursor to produce porous carbon adsorbent material using a combination of thermal (pyrolysis, 600–700 °C) and chemical (H3PO4 and KOH) methods. The derived fine black powder was impregnated by 10–50 wt% polyethyleneimine (PEI) to produce porous carbon material (PEI-PCM) for evaluation of the performance of CO2 adsorption under TGA (micro-scale system). To observe the PEI loading and relevant CO2 capture selectivity characteristics, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) were carried out. The XRD pattern showed the main phase of amorphous carbon, graphite, and some impurities (ZnS). Type II adsorption isotherm is related with reducing of the specific surface area and pore volume from 78 m2·g−1 to 25.26 m2·g−1, 0.45 cm3·g−1 to 0.23 cm3·g−1, respectively. The FT-IR spectra indicated the bending of primary and secondary amine which belonged to PEI molecule. It can be concluded that PEI-PCM properties such as, pore-size distribution, pore volume and surface functional groups supported CO2 adsorption capability following surface structure modification. The 50 wt% PEI-PCM-P showed good adsorption capacity of 53.81 mg·g−1 at temperatures of 75 °C. As a result, the PEI-PCM was successfully developed for CO2 absorption application. This work can help mitigating the challenge of disposal of WT and realization of the bio-circular-green economy (BCG model).
