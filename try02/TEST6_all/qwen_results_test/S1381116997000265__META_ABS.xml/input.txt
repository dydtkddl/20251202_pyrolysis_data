Catalytic conversion of proplyene oxide on a super acid sulfonic clay (SASC) system Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (triflic acid) and montmorillonite type clay were used to prepare a super acid sulfonic clay (SASC) with Ho < − 12.75 (Hammett acidity function). The clay activity was evaluated in the propylene oxide conversion including solvolysis with a series of alcohols, at O°, 20° and 25°C, yielding high conversion (88.9 to 99.8%) and selectivity (27.6 to 80.8%) to monomer formation. The clay was regenerated at least three times, recovering the total activity level after drying the catalyst 24 h at 110°C, under vacuum. The main properties of the acidic clay were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Hammett indicators technique and other spectroscopic and analytical methods.
