You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Magnesium stabilized 12-tungstophosphoric acid impregnated SBA-15 for selective monolaurin production The wetness incipient method was used for the incorporation of Keggin structured 12-tungstophophoric acid (HPW) onto the magnesium modified SBA-15. All the synthesized catalysts were then characterized using FTIR, XRD, TEM, NH3-TPD, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis. The results obtained confirmed the successful synthesis of SBA-15 and the anchoring of HPW on the MgSBA-15. Based on the experimental findings, it was found that catalyst loaded with 30 wt.% HPW had the highest lauric acid conversion (49.82%) and monolaurin yield (29.20%) as compared to other loadings. By using 30 wt.% HPW/MgSBA-15, the highest lauric acid conversion (78.31%) and monolaurin yield (55.35%) was achieved at reaction conditions of 160 ℃, 3 wt.% catalyst loading, and 4:1 glycerol/lauric acid ratio after 6 h of reaction time. Lastly, the catalyst was highly stable as it can be reused up to two times under identical process parameters without significant change in lauric acid conversion (77%). Such results revealed the strong interaction between the HPW and its support through the magnesium bridge.
