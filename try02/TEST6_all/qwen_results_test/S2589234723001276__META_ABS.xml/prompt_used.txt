You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on bismuth-sulfide-based compounds Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3)-based compounds have attracted considerable research attention in recent years owing to the intriguing features and widespread applicability of Bi2S3. This paper presents a detailed discussion on the characterization methods and material properties (such as structural and chemical characteristics, electronic band energy, etc.) of Bi2S3. Furthermore, simulation and experimental approaches to determine the fundamental chemical and physical properties of Bi2S3-based materials have been discussed. Herein, the physical (hot wall, thermal, sputtering, Bridgman method, and so on) and chemical routes (sol-gel processing, mechanochemical milling, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, microwave deposition, pyrolysis, chemical bath deposition, etc.) for synthesizing Bi2S3 and its composites are methodically presented along with their merits and demerits. In addition, the techniques associated with the application of Bi2S3-based compounds in various fields, including chemistry, optics, electronics, biomedical and materials sciences, and so on, are highlighted. Finally, future directions for utilizing Bi2S3 are proposed. The paper cumulatively covers the mechanisms, phenomena, and properties of Bi2S3 and its composites reported in the literature to date.
