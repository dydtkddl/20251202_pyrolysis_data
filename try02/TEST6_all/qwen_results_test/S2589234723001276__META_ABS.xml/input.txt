A comprehensive review on bismuth-sulfide-based compounds Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3)-based compounds have attracted considerable research attention in recent years owing to the intriguing features and widespread applicability of Bi2S3. This paper presents a detailed discussion on the characterization methods and material properties (such as structural and chemical characteristics, electronic band energy, etc.) of Bi2S3. Furthermore, simulation and experimental approaches to determine the fundamental chemical and physical properties of Bi2S3-based materials have been discussed. Herein, the physical (hot wall, thermal, sputtering, Bridgman method, and so on) and chemical routes (sol-gel processing, mechanochemical milling, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, microwave deposition, pyrolysis, chemical bath deposition, etc.) for synthesizing Bi2S3 and its composites are methodically presented along with their merits and demerits. In addition, the techniques associated with the application of Bi2S3-based compounds in various fields, including chemistry, optics, electronics, biomedical and materials sciences, and so on, are highlighted. Finally, future directions for utilizing Bi2S3 are proposed. The paper cumulatively covers the mechanisms, phenomena, and properties of Bi2S3 and its composites reported in the literature to date.
