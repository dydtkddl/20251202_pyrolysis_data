Regulation of biomass physicochemical properties for fuel quality improvement by pretreatment technology: A review To address the issues of high oxygen content, low energy density, and difficulties in transportation and storage associated with biomass, utilizing pretreatment technologies to enhance the conversion efficiency for producing biofuels and high-value chemicals, improve product yield and quality, reduce energy consumption in subsequent conversion processes, and decrease the number of enzymes or other chemicals required, thereby lowering overall production costs and increasing market competitiveness. Given the diversity and complex composition of biomass and varying impacts on pyrolysis, it is crucial to select appropriate pretreatment methods suitable for specific biomass types. The renewability of biomass is one of the main bottlenecks in the development of lignocellulosic biorefining, and physicochemical pretreatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis are two methods that can work together to overcome this instability. The combined application of mechanical crushing, thermal treatment, and other physical technologies can achieve synergy effects, improving processing efficiency. This work provides a comprehensive summary of pretreatment technologies prior to biomass pyrolysis, detailing the mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages. Considering issues such as economic viability, environmental protection, and scalability, highlighting the significant potential value of combined pretreatment technologies in the high-value utilization of biomass, along with the shortcomings of current pretreatment technologies and future development trends. It emphasizes the impact of torrefaction on the quality of subsequent pyrolysis products (bio-oil, biochar, and biogas), as well as the economic benefits and future directions it brings to production applications, while also providing a theoretical foundation and guidance for the large-scale application of alcohol fuels.
