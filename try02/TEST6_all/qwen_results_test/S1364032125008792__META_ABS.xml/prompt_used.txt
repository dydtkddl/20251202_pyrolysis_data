You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste plastic-derived carbon materials for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries Valorization of waste plastics into hydrogen and carbon materials is a promising way to achieve both waste resources upcycling and valuable materials production. Owing to their tunable physicochemical properties, researchers have made great progress in developing waste plastic-derived carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage applications. In common, the carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, porous carbon, hard carbon, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be produced from the carbonization of waste plastics. The features of carbon nanomaterials such as specific porous structure, specific surface area, heteroatoms dopants, and various surface functional groups of diversely dimensional carbon structures can significantly affect the electrochemical performance. This review concludes the preparation of carbon materials with different dimensional structures from waste plastics by thermochemical conversion processes such as catalytic pyrolysis and carbonization. The recent advances in transformation of various waste plastics to diverse carbon materials such as graphene, CNTs, carbon nanospheres (CSs), carbon nanosheets (CNs), porous carbons and their composites are highlighted. Furthermore, the research advances and challenges in the applications of waste plastic-derived carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries (e.g., lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and zinc-air batteries) are concluded for promoting the coordinated development of energy storage materials science and the environmental protection industry.
