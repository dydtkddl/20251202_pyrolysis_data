Waste plastic-derived carbon materials for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries Valorization of waste plastics into hydrogen and carbon materials is a promising way to achieve both waste resources upcycling and valuable materials production. Owing to their tunable physicochemical properties, researchers have made great progress in developing waste plastic-derived carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage applications. In common, the carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, porous carbon, hard carbon, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be produced from the carbonization of waste plastics. The features of carbon nanomaterials such as specific porous structure, specific surface area, heteroatoms dopants, and various surface functional groups of diversely dimensional carbon structures can significantly affect the electrochemical performance. This review concludes the preparation of carbon materials with different dimensional structures from waste plastics by thermochemical conversion processes such as catalytic pyrolysis and carbonization. The recent advances in transformation of various waste plastics to diverse carbon materials such as graphene, CNTs, carbon nanospheres (CSs), carbon nanosheets (CNs), porous carbons and their composites are highlighted. Furthermore, the research advances and challenges in the applications of waste plastic-derived carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries (e.g., lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and zinc-air batteries) are concluded for promoting the coordinated development of energy storage materials science and the environmental protection industry.
