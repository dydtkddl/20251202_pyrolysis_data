You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Post-consumer plastics/Co x Mn3–x O4 spinels derived Co/MnO@carbon nanotube composites towards advanced electromagnetic absorbents Waste plastics and electromagnetic radiation pollution have been two serious issues that largely affect our environment. How to solve them in a single approach is a social and scientific challenge. In this work, advanced Co/MnO@carbon nanotube composite (Co/MnO@CNTs) absorbents were prepared via pyrolysis-catalysis conversion of face masks as post-consumer plastic waste with multi-scale designed Co x Mn3–x O4 spinel pre-catalysts. The (nano)structure (e.g., MnO-carbon and Co-carbon hetero-interface), composition, and graphitic degree of the Co/MnO@CNTs absorbents were facilely controlled by varying the catalytic reaction temperature and the composition of spinel pre-catalysts. By constructing multi-loss mechanisms (e.g., magnetic loss, conductive loss, interface polarization loss, and defects-induced polarization loss), the largest effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of the Co/MnO@CNTs/wax composites can reach as wide as 5.28 GHz at a thickness of 1.7 mm. When the content of the Co/MnO@CNTs absorbents is 17 wt%, the EAB and minimal reflection loss (RL min) achieves 5.04 GHz and −38.1 dB, respectively. This work is based on a sustainable and cost-effective feedstock as well as an innovative method for the large-scale production of advanced CNTs-based materials in electromagnetic absorption application.
