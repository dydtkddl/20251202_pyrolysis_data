You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cost-effective micro/mesoporous biochar derived from soda residue-assisted hydrocarbonization and activation of crop waste for sulfamethoxazole removal from water environments The low-cost transformation of agricultural biowaste into high-value biochar materials presents substantial technological and economic challenges. In this study, we report for the first time that soda residue can effectively substitute for chemical activation agents to produce micro/mesoporous biochars (MMBs) with a well-developed specific surface area (473.73 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.55 cm3 g−1). These MMBs exhibit exceptional sorption capacity for the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole in aqueous solutions, reaching a maximum sorption capacity of 92.97 mg g−1. The sorption mechanism is governed by multiple interactions, including pore filling, hydrogen bonding, partitioning, electrostatic interactions, and π-π stacking. MMBs demonstrate superior stability, excellent reusability, cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility, and strong anti-interference capability, rendering them highly suitable for practical applications. This study opens new avenues for the sustainable recycling of soda residue and biowaste and the fabrication of high-performance porous biochars while also providing an efficient and eco-friendly sorbent for environmental remediation.
