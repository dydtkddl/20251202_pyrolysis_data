You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling and simulation of combustion processes of charring and non-charring solid fuels Some of the progress that, owing to modeling and numerical simulation, has been made to the understanding of chemical and physical processes, which occur during combustion of solid fuels, is presented. The first part of the review deals with thermal degradation processes of charring (2ood and, in general, cellulosic materials) and non-charring (poly-methyl-methacrylate) materials. Gas-phase combustion processes (ignition, flame spread and extinction) are discussed in the second part of the review. Solid fuel degradation has been described by kinetic models of different complexity, varying from a simple one-step global reaction, to multi-step reaction mechanisms, accounting only for primary solid fuel degradation, and to semi-global reaction mechanisms, accounting for both primary solid degradation and secondary degradation of evolved primary pyrolysis products. Semi-global kinetic models have been coupled to models of transport phenomena to simulate thermal degradation of charring fuels under ablation regime conditions. The effects of bubble formation on the transport of volatiles during thermal degradation of non-charring fuels, described through a one-step global reaction, have also been modeled. On the contrary, very simplified treatments of solid phase processes have been used when gas phase combustion processes are also simulated. On the other hand, the latter have also always been described through one-step global reactions. Numerical modeling has allowed controlling mechanisms of ignition and flame spread to be determined and the understanding of the interaction between chemistry and physics during thermal degradation of solid fuels to be improved. However, the chemical processes are not well understood, the few kinetic data are in most cases empirical and variations of solid properties during degradation are very poorly known, so that even the most advanced models do not in general give quantitative predictions.
