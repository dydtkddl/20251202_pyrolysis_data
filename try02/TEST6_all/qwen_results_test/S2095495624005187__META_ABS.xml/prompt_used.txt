You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Navigating challenges and opportunities of machine learning in hydrogen catalysis and production processes: Beyond algorithm development With the projected global surge in hydrogen demand, driven by increasing applications and the imperative for low-emission hydrogen, the integration of machine learning (ML) across the hydrogen energy value chain is a compelling avenue. This review uniquely focuses on harnessing the synergy between ML and computational modeling (CM) or optimization tools, as well as integrating multiple ML techniques with CM, for the synthesis of diverse hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts and various hydrogen production processes (HPPs). Furthermore, this review addresses a notable gap in the literature by offering insights, analyzing challenges, and identifying research prospects and opportunities for sustainable hydrogen production. While the literature reflects a promising landscape for ML applications in hydrogen energy domains, transitioning AI-based algorithms from controlled environments to real-world applications poses significant challenges. Hence, this comprehensive review delves into the technical, practical, and ethical considerations associated with the application of ML in HER catalyst development and HPP optimization. Overall, this review provides guidance for unlocking the transformative potential of ML in enhancing prediction efficiency and sustainability in the hydrogen production sector.
