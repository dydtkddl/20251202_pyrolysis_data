You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing CNT yield and morphology from waste plastics: A study on catalyst composition and performance Waste plastic such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was catalytically pyrolyzed and decomposed to produce carbon nanotubes. Single metallic (Ni, Fe, Co) and bimetallic catalysts (Fe:Ni, Co:Ni, and Fe:Co) with active metals in the ratio of 1:3, 3:1, and 1:1, in which Mo is the promoter and Al2O3 as the catalyst support, they were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The catalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractogram (XRD), BET analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The synthesized carbon nanotubes were performed to assess each bimetallic catalyst's level of activity. Furthermore, the yield, purity, diameter, and number of walls in carbon nanotubes of products synthesized from LDPE using various ratios of bimetallic catalysts were compared. Results show that single metallic catalysts produced single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of diameter ranging from 2.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and bimetallic catalysts produced multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that have a diameter between 20.7 nm and 38.6 nm. Among single and bimetallic catalysts, Ni/Mo/Al2O3 and Fe:Ni (1:3)/ Mo/Al2O3 catalysts contributed to the high quality of carbon nanotubes with well-defined morphology and strong graphitization. In terms of yield, Fe/Mo/Al2O3 and Fe:Ni (3:1)/Mo/Al2O3 catalysts yield a maximum of about 37.2 % and 46.4 % CNTs, respectively. This study offers important insights into the catalytic pyrolysis process for recycling LDPE waste plastics by illustrating the connection between catalyst structure, CNT generation, and the shape of CNT. The results provide an efficient approach to developing superior CNTs while promoting environmental sustainability and the management of plastic waste.
