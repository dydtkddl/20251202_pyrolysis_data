Lignocellulosic biomass mixtures improve hydrogen production by promoting microbial complementation in a consolidated bioprocess Seasonal biomass availability could represent one of the main drawbacks to implementing large-scale biorefineries. The use of biomass mixtures such as agricultural wastes and grasslands is relevant to determine their effects on the performance of biological processes such as hydrogen (H2) production via consolidated bioprocess (CBP). This study evaluated the H2 production (Hmax) from primary, binary, and ternary mixtures of agave bagasse (AB), corn stover (CS), wheat straw (WS), and guinea grass (G), which served as substrates and inoculants in batch fermentations. Biomass mixtures significantly affected Hmax, where the binary mixtures G:AB and G:CS showed the highest values (8.9 ± 0.6 mL H2/g TS, respectively), which almost doubled the mean Hmax using the primary mixtures. Biomass mixtures formed two clusters: cluster A with the binary mixture G:CS and all AB-containing mixtures that positively correlated with Hmax, H2 yield, and hemicellulose removal while cluster B with the remaining biomass mixtures correlated with H2 production rate and hemicellulose content. Further analysis revealed that AB provided key bacteria like Pantoaea dispersa, Klebsiella variicola, and Kosakonia cowanii that contributed to lignin degradation and formed a highly interconnected microbial network with Lachnoclostridium that provided oligosaccharides to H2-producing bacteria and Clostridium beijerinckii that produced H2 from lactate. The non-AB-containing mixtures (cluster B) formed a poorly interconnected microbial network where lignin degraders were missing. This study demonstrated that the biomass that provided lignin degraders was more relevant for improving H2 production via CBP than the biomasses that provided a high content of carbohydrates.
