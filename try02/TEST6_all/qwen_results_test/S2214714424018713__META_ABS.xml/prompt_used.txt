You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic ozonation of ciprofloxacin using MnO2/biochar nanohybrid integrated with peroxymonosulfate in a circulating fluidized bed reactor The objective of this study is to prepare a biochar catalyst loaded with manganese (IV) oxide to enhance the degradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) antibiotic in the catalytic ozonation process (COP) and COP/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) process. XPS, FE-SEM, EDS, TEM, XRD, FTIR, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were used to characterize the β-MnO2/biochar catalyst. According to N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, activation at 800 °C in 120 min with a weight ratio of 1:1 (KOH/BC) fabricates biochar with a high specific surface area (1149 m2.gr−1). The results of the characterization techniques confirmed the successful loading of β-MnO2 nanorods on the porous biochar substrate. D-optimal method to save time and cost of experiments. Based on the results, the optimal conditions in the COP were obtained with the catalyst amount of 0.15 g L−1, initial CIP concentration of 20 ppm, input ozone flow rate of 1.25 mg min−1, and pH = 7. The degradation efficiencies of CIP in 30 min for COP and sole ozonation process (SOP) were 98.7 and 48.8 %, respectively. PMS was used, to improve the degradation rate and mineralization efficiency of the processes. The results showed that the degradation rate increased from 0.120 min−1 to 0.219 min−1 in the presence of PMS. Measuring the COD showed the high performance of the COP/PMS process compared to COP and SOP with a mineralization efficiency of 78, 56.4, and 17.1 % within 30 min, respectively. The reactive oxygen species involved in the mentioned processes were identified by inorganic and organic scavengers. According to the results, the •OH had the largest contribution to these processes. The circulating fluidized bed reactor showed better performance compared to the semi-continuous reactor due to better mixing conditions. The β-MnO2/BC1 – 800-120 catalyst could maintain its catalytic activity after three cycles of use in the COP, which shows its high stability.
