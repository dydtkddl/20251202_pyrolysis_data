You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The synergistic effecting mechanisms of biomass pyrolysis, biomass char gasification, and biomass ash on CO2 co-gasification of biomass and high-sulfur petroleum coke To investigate the synergistic effecting mechanisms of biomass pyrolysis, biomass char gasification, and biomass ash during the co-gasification of biomass and high-sulfur petroleum coke (PC), various biomass waste (B), biomass char (CB) and low-temperature ash of biomass (AB) were blended with PC. Gasification reaction characteristics of B, PC, and their respective mixtures were assessed using a thermogravimetric analyzer. Their gasification reactivity, synergistic effects, and kinetic parameters were comprehensively compared. The total ionic potential (TMP) was defined to quantify the catalytic capacity. The results indicated that the incorporation of B, CB, and AB significantly boosted the gasification reactivity of PC，and the pyrolysis stage (SP) and the gasification stage (SG) of PC:B exhibited antagonistic and synergistic interactions, respectively. The first-order chemical reaction (Q1) proved more suitable for SP, whereas the core-shrinkage model (R2) was more applicable for SG. The mechanisms of B, CB, and AB improving the gasification reactivity of PC were different (B and CB: by lowering active energy). The catalytic capacity was negatively correlated with the TMP. The mechanism of AB catalyzed PC-CO2 gasification varied with the mineral composition. The participation of organic matter in B and CB would promote the formation of Lewis Base Center metal–organic frameworks, thereby improving the catalytic capacity of inorganic components by increasing the pre-exponential factor and the reaction rate constant.
