You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantification and identification of microfibers released from textiles during simulated accelerated washing Microplastics, including plastic microfibers, consist of a wide range of materials of varying composition and morphology, as well as surface chemistry. Given their already demonstrated ubiquity in the environment and the inherent complexity of the different matrices in which these are found, detection and quantification methods are, consequently, quite disparate and gathered data are often not amenable for comparison. As such, methods for the sampling, quantification and characterization of microplastics should be fit-for-purpose, meaning that they should account for the scientific questions being asked within a determined setting and environment. However, within identical matrices and between comparable research questions, methodologies should match, and standardization should be applied. As such, in this work, fibers from different fabrics were subjected to a simulated accelerated washing process to determine the release of microfibers into the resulting water following established and defined international standards. Though there are numerous examples of scientific works delving into this subject, the present work constitutes an initial step towards the use of internationally recognized methodologies for the determination of microfibers during washing processes that, when in conjunction with other similarly carried out works, may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of release of these materials during everyday activities, such as washing and drying of clothes. Furthermore, experimental results showed that special care and attention should be paid when resorting to automated software-based identification of microplastics in environmental matrices, as this may not be as accurate as previously considered, particularly for increasingly used techniques, such as pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
