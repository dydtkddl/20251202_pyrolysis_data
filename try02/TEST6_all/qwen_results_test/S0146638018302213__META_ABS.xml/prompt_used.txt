You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Suppression of vitrinite reflectance by bitumen generated from liptinite during hydrous pyrolysis of artificial source rock Mean random vitrinite reflectance (Ro) is the most widely accepted method to determine thermal maturity of coal and other sedimentary rocks. However, oil-immersion Ro of polished rock or kerogen samples is commonly lower than Ro values measured in samples from adjacent vitrinite-rich coals that have undergone the same level of thermal stress. So-called suppressed Ro values have also been observed in hydrous pyrolysis experiments designed to simulate petroleum formation. Various hypotheses to explain Ro suppression, such as sorption of products generated from liptinite during maturation, diagenetic formation of perhydrous vitrinite or overpressure, remain controversial. To experimentally test for suppression of vitrinite reflectance, artificial rock was prepared using silica and a calcined blend of limestone and clay with various proportions of thermally immature vitrinite-rich Wyodak-Anderson coal and liptinite-rich kerogen isolated from the oil-prone Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation. The samples were subjected to hydrous pyrolysis for 72 h. at isothermal temperatures of 300 °C, 330 °C, and 350 °C to simulate burial maturation. Compared to artificial rock that contains only coal, samples with different proportions of oil-prone kerogen show distinct suppression of calibrated Ro at 300 °C and 330 °C. The reflectance of solid bitumen generated during heating of the samples is lower than that of the associated vitrinite and does not interfere with the Ro measurements. These results provide the first experimental evidence that Ro suppression occurs in vitrinite mixed with liptinite-rich kerogen in a rock matrix. Although the precise chemical mechanism for Ro suppression by liptinite remains unclear, free radicals generated from solid bitumen and associated volatile products during maturation of liptinite may contribute to termination reactions that slow the aromatization and rearrangement of polyaromatic sheets in vitrinite, thus suppressing Ro. This mechanism does not preclude Ro suppression that might result from overpressure or differences in redox conditions during diagenesis.
