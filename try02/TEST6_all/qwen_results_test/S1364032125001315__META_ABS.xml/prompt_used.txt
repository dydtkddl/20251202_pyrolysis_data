You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring seaweed as a sustainable solution for carbon dioxide adsorption: Trends, opportunities, and future research prospects Numerous industrial activities burn fossil fuels, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and worsening climate change. To mitigate this, industries are integrating adsorption technology, using activated carbon as an adsorbent to reduce CO2 emissions. Recently, seaweed has emerged as a promising precursor for activated carbon, similar to coconut shells. However, a gap exists in the literature, as no comprehensive study has systematically reviewed seaweed-derived activated carbon for CO2 adsorption applications. Hence, this study addresses this gap by integrating a systematic review and bibliometric analysis, offering a novel methodological approach for a holistic understanding of the topic. The study formulates research questions, develops a systematic search strategy, and employs bibliometric analysis, science mapping, and qualitative content analysis of data from the Scopus database to interpret, analyze, and discuss the findings. It highlights a rising publication trend from 2013 to 2023, with China as the leading contributor, and underscores that research on this topic is mainly published in high-quality journals. Science mapping reveals key research themes and identifies existing gaps, while qualitative analysis provides directions for future studies. The study also emphasizes the significant potential of seaweed-derived activated carbon in applications such as wastewater treatment, air filtration, energy storage, and green fuel production, while its exploration in CO2 adsorption remains limited. Therefore, the potential for further research is outlined in the future research recommendations. Ultimately, this study offers valuable insights for various stakeholders and supports Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13.
