You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of Bambusa striata shavings into functional superparamagnetic material and its application in biodiesel production: Response surface optimization, kinetics, thermodynamics and economic assessment Herein, a novel highly porous biomass-based (Bambusa vulgaris striata) magnetic solid acid catalyst was developed for the first time via simultaneous activation and magnetization followed by acid functionalization. The sulfonated magnetic porous carbon was utilized as a catalyst for transesterifying Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) to biodiesel under microwave irradiation. The synthesized catalyst was extensively characterized using VSM, XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDS, TGA, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and AFM techniques. Through Response Surface Methodology (RSM), a maximal biodiesel yield of 98.8 % was achieved over optimal optimal parametric states (catalyst loading 8 wt%, MOMR 24:1, 50 min, 80 °C). NMR confirmed JCO biodiesel formation with a FAME content of 98.04 %, and GCMS provided insight into its chemical composition. A pseudo-first-order kinetic study revealed an activation energy (Ea) of 28.734 kJ mol 1. Thermodynamic analysis showed endothermic and non-spontaneous behavior with ΔH#, ΔS#, and ΔG# values of 25.928 kJ mol 1, −0.193 kJ mol 1 K 1, and 94.251 kJ mol 1, respectively. The catalyst displayed good reusability, easy recoverability, and stability, maintaining 75.4 % oil conversion even after ten consecutive cycles. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) estimates biodiesel production cost of $0.60 per liter, emphasizing high commercial viability.
