Emerging trends and advances in valorization of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels Sustainable technologies pave the way to address future energy demand by converting lignocellulosic biomass into fuels, carbon-neutral materials, and chemicals which might replace fossil fuels. Thermochemical and biochemical technologies are conventional methods that convert biomass into value-added products. To enhance biofuel production, the existing technologies should be upgraded using advanced processes. In this regard, the present review explores the advanced technologies of thermochemical processes such as plasma technology, hydrothermal treatment, microwave-based processing, microbial-catalyzed electrochemical systems, etc. Advanced biochemical technologies such as synthetic metabolic engineering and genomic engineering have led to the development of an effective strategy to produce biofuels. The microwave-plasma-based technique increases the biofuel conversion efficiency by 97% and the genetic engineering strains increase the sugar production by 40%, inferring that the advanced technologies enhances the efficiency. So understanding these processes leads to low-carbon technologies which can solve the global issues on energy security, the greenhouse gases emission, and global warming.
