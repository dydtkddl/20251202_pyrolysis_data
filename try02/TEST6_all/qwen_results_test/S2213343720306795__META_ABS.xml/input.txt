A review on pollutants removal by Sono-photo -Fenton processes Among advanced oxidation processes often used for treatment, Sono- Photo-Fenton processes (S-P-FP) receive a lot of attention due to high pollutant degradation efficiency. This review highlights the fundamentals and main applications of methods such as Fenton, photo-Fenton with emphasis on S-P-FP. The S-P-FP method is capable to dwindle the drawbacks of advanced oxidation based on the Fenton process through direct and synergistic effects of ultrasound and light (photo) which lead to the highest generation of reactive radicals such as various radicals such as •OH, •H and •OOH are produced besides the catalytic role of ferrous ions. In this review have been investigated effective parameters include pH, H2O2, pollutant and Fe2+/3+ concentration, catalyst dosage, light intensity, ultrasonic power and temperature on the S-P-FP. Also, the main factors influencing the US efficiency are sonication frequency, acoustic intensity, bulk temperature, and static pressure. This review also highlights energy consumption evaluation of S-P-FP versus other AOPs and results indicated the S-P-FP has less TCS due to energy savings because decreasing of energy consumption.
