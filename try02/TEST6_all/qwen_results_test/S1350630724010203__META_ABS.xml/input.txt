Investigation of surface structuring and oxidation performance of Inconel 718 superalloy by laser remelting with different patterns The current paper deals with the effect of CO2 laser remelting on the surface structuring and oxidation performance of Inconel 718 superalloy, pointing out different laser-induced surface patterns that make a difference in their oxidation properties vital for high-temperature applications. Surface roughness, microstructure, and oxidation behavior characterization were performed using 3D optical profilometry, SEM, and XRD techniques. The oxidation tests conducted at 1000 °C for 24 h have revealed that remelted surfaces offered better oxidation resistance compared to untreated samples. Notably, the patterned sample showed the lowest weight gain under oxidation, and a parabolic regime in oxidation occurred after 100 min; while in an untreated reference sample, this appears only after 200 min. This improvement in performance results from the formation of a chromium-rich oxide layer on the melt pools, which acts as an effective barrier against further oxidation. The findings show that laser remelting, especially with grid-like surface patterns, results in an improvement in both durability and high-temperature performance of Inconel 718; therefore, it is apparently a very promising technique for lifespan extension of industrially relevant materials.
