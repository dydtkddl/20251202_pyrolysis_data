You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of surface structuring and oxidation performance of Inconel 718 superalloy by laser remelting with different patterns The current paper deals with the effect of CO2 laser remelting on the surface structuring and oxidation performance of Inconel 718 superalloy, pointing out different laser-induced surface patterns that make a difference in their oxidation properties vital for high-temperature applications. Surface roughness, microstructure, and oxidation behavior characterization were performed using 3D optical profilometry, SEM, and XRD techniques. The oxidation tests conducted at 1000 °C for 24 h have revealed that remelted surfaces offered better oxidation resistance compared to untreated samples. Notably, the patterned sample showed the lowest weight gain under oxidation, and a parabolic regime in oxidation occurred after 100 min; while in an untreated reference sample, this appears only after 200 min. This improvement in performance results from the formation of a chromium-rich oxide layer on the melt pools, which acts as an effective barrier against further oxidation. The findings show that laser remelting, especially with grid-like surface patterns, results in an improvement in both durability and high-temperature performance of Inconel 718; therefore, it is apparently a very promising technique for lifespan extension of industrially relevant materials.
