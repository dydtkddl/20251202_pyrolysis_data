Multidimensionality in planar chromatography Multidimensionality in planar chromatography takes on a broader context than is common for column separations. Multidimensional methods used to improve the separation capacity in planar chromatography include unidimensional multiple development and two-dimensional development practiced under conditions of capillary controlled or forced flow of the mobile phase, mobile phase gradients and system automation. Theoretical considerations, the correct approach to methods development, instrumental requirements and contemporary applications of these approaches are outlined in this review. Interfacing column chromatographic methods, such as gas, liquid or supercritical fluid as one dimension and planar chromatography as the second, are not commonly mentioned in the literature but offer some unique possibilities for enhancing both separations and detection. These approaches are outlined here with a view to increasing the awareness of their potential for complex mixture analysis, component identification and trace analysis.
