Degradation-reconstruction-functional enhancement coupled upcycling of waste PET into recycled thermoplastic polyurethane with P-N synergistic flame retardancy Functional regeneration of waste plastics is a pivotal strategy for sustainable development. This study has developed a method for functional and collaborative upgrading recycling of waste PET. By using chemical alcoholysis and copolymerization techniques, the waste PET is chemically modified into flame-retardant polyester polyols (rFR POL). It is then used as functional soft segments to polymerize, resulting in the synthesis of recycled high transparency, weather-resistant, and flame-retardant thermoplastic polyurethane (rFR TPU). Research shows using rFR POL as a soft segment cuts petroleum-based material use by 57 % in TPU production. And this enhances the transparency, hydrolysis resistance and flame retardancy of TPU films. After 14 days of hydrolysis and thermal weight loss tests, it was found that the molecular weight of rFR50 % TPU remains almost unchanged, with a high T5wt % (225 °C). For rFR100 % TPU, the phosphorus content increases to 19,680 ppm, the LOI reaches 35.30 %, and the vertical burning is rated V-0. The flame retardancy mechanism is attributed to the synergistic gas phase and condensed phase flame retardant effects of P-N. The total GWP of this process is 2800 kg CO2 equivalent, and the total cost is $1342 per ton, which is 37.8 % and 42 % lower than traditional petroleum-based TPU production, respectively. This process reduces polyester fire risks, fundamentally solves functional chain migration and excessive modifier issues. It also achieves upgraded recycling of non-biodegradable polyester, providing an innovative solution for green flame-retardant polymer development.
