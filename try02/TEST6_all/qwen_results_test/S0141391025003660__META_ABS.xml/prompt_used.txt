You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation-reconstruction-functional enhancement coupled upcycling of waste PET into recycled thermoplastic polyurethane with P-N synergistic flame retardancy Functional regeneration of waste plastics is a pivotal strategy for sustainable development. This study has developed a method for functional and collaborative upgrading recycling of waste PET. By using chemical alcoholysis and copolymerization techniques, the waste PET is chemically modified into flame-retardant polyester polyols (rFR POL). It is then used as functional soft segments to polymerize, resulting in the synthesis of recycled high transparency, weather-resistant, and flame-retardant thermoplastic polyurethane (rFR TPU). Research shows using rFR POL as a soft segment cuts petroleum-based material use by 57 % in TPU production. And this enhances the transparency, hydrolysis resistance and flame retardancy of TPU films. After 14 days of hydrolysis and thermal weight loss tests, it was found that the molecular weight of rFR50 % TPU remains almost unchanged, with a high T5wt % (225 °C). For rFR100 % TPU, the phosphorus content increases to 19,680 ppm, the LOI reaches 35.30 %, and the vertical burning is rated V-0. The flame retardancy mechanism is attributed to the synergistic gas phase and condensed phase flame retardant effects of P-N. The total GWP of this process is 2800 kg CO2 equivalent, and the total cost is $1342 per ton, which is 37.8 % and 42 % lower than traditional petroleum-based TPU production, respectively. This process reduces polyester fire risks, fundamentally solves functional chain migration and excessive modifier issues. It also achieves upgraded recycling of non-biodegradable polyester, providing an innovative solution for green flame-retardant polymer development.
