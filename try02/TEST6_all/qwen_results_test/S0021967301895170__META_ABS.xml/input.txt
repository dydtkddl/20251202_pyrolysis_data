High-performance liquid chromatography separation media based on functional polymers containing phenolic hydroxyls New separation media based on highly cross-linked porous-bead polymers containing pendant phenolic groups have been prepared. The steric environment and acidity of the phenolic groups have been varied systematically to provide access to a new family of separation media useful in the separation of aromatic as well as aliphatic amines. The bead polymers with 10 μm average size are prepared by suspension polymerization of 4-tert.-butyloxycaronyl (t-BOC derivatives of 4-hydroxystyrene or analogues with alkyl substituents in positions 3 and 5, with divinylbenzene under conditions which afford polymers with surface areas of more than 200 m2/g. The t-BOC groups are removed from the bead polymers by a thermolysis process which greatly facilitates bead processing. The unclassified polymers gave high-performance liquid chromatography columns with approximately 18 000 plates per meter and were found to be very effective in the separation of amines.
