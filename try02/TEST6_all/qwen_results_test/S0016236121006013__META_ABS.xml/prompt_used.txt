You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

ReaxFF molecular dynamics study on pyrolysis of bicyclic compounds for aviation fuel In this paper, we investigate the initial fuel pyrolysis of four bicyclic compounds, which are potential alternative jet fuels, using ReaxFF force field based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These fuels can be separated into two categories, (a) cyclic alkanes attached through a 4-membered ring and (b) cyclic alkanes attached through a single C–C bond. We use a systematic procedure to investigate the reaction chemistry of all these fuel molecules. Global Arrhenius parameters, such as activation energies and pre-exponential factors, are calculated and used to analyze the overall decomposition kinetics of the fuels. The bicyclic fuels have a faster or comparable decomposition rate compared to some existing jet-fuels, such as JP-10. These fuels decompose through two main reaction classes. One pathway is the cleavage of the central bond leading to the formation of two cyclic radicals or species. Second class of reactions involves ring opening leading to the formation of small alkene molecules. The importance of these reactions in fuel decomposition process is found to be highly temperature dependent. This work demonstrates that ReaxFF can be used to investigate pyrolysis and combustion chemistry of existing or future fuels and to potentially contribute to the development of their chemical kinetic models without any a priori input and chemical intuition.
