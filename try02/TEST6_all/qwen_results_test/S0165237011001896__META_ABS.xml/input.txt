Kinetics of tetrabromobisphenol A pyrolysis. Comparison between correlation and mechanistic models Brominated flame retardants are well recognized as being highly effective flame retardants. 4-4′-Isopropylidenebis(2,6-dibromophenol), commonly known as tetrabromobisphenol A, is the brominated flame retardant with the largest production volume and is used to improve fire safety, mainly of laminates in electrical and electronic equipment. A kinetic study of the pyrolysis of TBBA has been carried out to obtain decomposition parameters under different operating conditions and taking into account that TBBA is a compound with a high boiling point and that vaporization occurs simultaneously to decomposition. Dynamic runs and dynamic+isothermal run at different heating rates and using different masses of sample were correlated simultaneously. All TG runs were fitted with a unique set of kinetic parameters that is able to explain all the experiments. Moreover, a simplified detailed kinetic model has been developed and the kinetic parameters obtained satisfactorily reproduce the thermal decomposition of TBBA.
