You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable hydrogen production via methane decomposition using FeNi bimetallic catalysts Catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) is emerging as an efficient, greenhouse gas emission-free path for hydrogen production. This study demonstrates the notable performance of bimetallic FeNi catalysts in CDM. Incorporating nickel into an iron-based catalyst significantly enhances methane conversion and hydrogen yield, with the benefit of producing valuable carbon nanotubes (CNT) as a byproduct. The 40Fe5Ni catalyst exhibits remarkable performance with 86 % methane conversion. A kinetic model is proposed; the removal of the first hydrogen atom from methane is the rate-determining step following its molecular adsorption on the catalyst surface. Additionally, catalyst deactivation is observed to follow first-order kinetics, with progressive accumulation of carbon deposits leading to a decline in catalytic activity over time. Furthermore, systematic DFT calculations reveal that FeNi alloying shifts the d-band center, strengthening intermediate adsorption and enhancing methane decomposition for efficient hydrogen production. Overall, FeNi bimetallic catalysts emerge as a cost-effective, scalable solution for sustainable hydrogen production, enabling carbon-neutral energy from methane.
