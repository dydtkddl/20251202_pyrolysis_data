You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance of NiAl2O4 spinel derived catalyst + dolomite in the sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of raw bio-oil in cyclic operation The production of H2 from raw bio-oil with high yield and purity requires the development of reforming technologies with low energy requirements, minimized CO2 emissions, and stable and regenerable catalysts. This work studies the performance (activity, selectivity, stability and regenerability) in the sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) of raw bio-oil of a catalyst prepared by reduction of a NiAl2O4 spinel together with dolomite as CO2 sorbent. The reaction runs were carried out in a fluidized-bed reactor under the following conditions: 550–700 °C; space time, 0.15 and 0.30 gcatalyst·h/goxygenates; dolomite/catalyst mass ratio, 10 and 20; steam/carbon (S/C) molar ratio, 3.4; time on stream, 50 and 300 min. The highest H2 yield (>92 %) and purity (>99 %) in the CO2 capture period are obtained in the 600–650 °C range and with a dolomite/catalyst mass ratio of 10, due to synergy between catalyst and sorbent activity. The catalyst/sorbent system can be regenerated (4 h in air at 850 °C and subsequent reduction at 900 °C) and used in the successive reaction-regeneration cycles. The results are of relevant interest to progress towards scale-up of this process, which combines sustainable production of high purity H2 from biomass with CO2 capture.
