You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unmasking per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in facemasks: Occurrence and leaching implications The extensive use and disposal of facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing post-pandemic impacts have heightened potential risks of human exposure and environmental release of emerging contaminants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This study quantifies 21 PFAS (∑21PFAS), estimates unidentified PFAS precursors, and evaluates leaching under disposal-relevant conditions from prominent facemasks, extending previous research by addressing leaching behavior and expanding the dataset to Chinese-market products. We found relatively low ∑21PFAS concentrations (0.68–5.3 ng/g) in facemasks, with 0.49–2.3 ng/g release to water. Notably, the tested reusable cloth facemask contained substantial amounts of unidentified precursors in both solids and leachates, as revealed by the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay. PFAS leaching was thermodynamically non-spontaneous, with leachability varying from 14.8 % to 84.7 %, depending on the chemical properties of PFAS. Furthermore, leachate conditions significantly impacted PFAS release, with a ∼14 % increase in leaching due to a 10℃ temperature rise and a 102–300 % increase due to the presence of dissolved organic matter. With an annual disposal of 250–480 billion facemasks, it is estimated that these facemasks release 0.72–1.4 kg of ∑21PFAS and 0.50–0.98 kg of ∑7PFCAs (seven commonly measured perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids) into leachates, contributing only 0.1–0.2 % to the total PFAS load in leachates at disposal facilities.
