You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A new sustainable strategy for oil, CH4 and aluminum recovery from metallised food packaging plastics waste using catalytic pyrolysis over ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst Paraffin wax and syngas are the major energy products synthesized by pyrolysis of metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW). These pyrolysis products contain a small amount of flammable compounds with negligible economic profit. Within this framework, this work aims to upgrade wax into oil and to increase the yield of flammable gases (e.g., CH4, C2H6, C3H8) in syngas generated during pyrolysis of MFPW using the catalytic pyrolysis process over ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (10, 30, and 50 wt.%). The thermo-chemical experiments were performed in a semi-batch pyrolysis plant at 600°C. N2, O2, CO2, CO, CH4, and H2 gases generated during the entire process were observed with a digital gas analyser, while FTIR and GC measurements were employed to specify the chemical compounds of the obtained energy products (oil or wax and gases). Finally, aluminium (Al) fraction was separated from the obtained solid product of pyrolysis using leaching process. The results showed that addition of 10 and 30 wt.% of ZSM-5 to the reaction contributed to increase in wax yield from 12% to 19% without a significant effect on its structure. At 50 wt.% of ZSM-5, wax was converted into light hydrocarbon oil abundant in flammable compounds such as p-Xylene (18.2%), Benzene (14.6%), Toluene (7.3%), and o-Xylene (4.7%). Also, GC-MS results revealed that the gas obtained from 50 wt.% batch was rich in CH group (derived from CH4 compound) and Toluene (33%), p-Xylene (27%), Benzene (14.4%). Based on that the catalytic pyrolysis with 50 wt.% ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is considered to be a promising thermo-chemical technology that can be applied at industrial scale to convert MFPW into oil (21%), gas (66%), Al (8.8%), and Al-free char particles (3.12%).
