You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Functional biobased resin from a blend of tannin and crude black liquor and its application as an adsorbent for dexamethasone and indomethacin removal A novel route is proposed to synthesize a functional biobased resin and its carbonized counterpart by sol-gel polymerization of a blend of tannin and crude Kraft black liquor. The potential of the synthesized biomaterial as adsorbents for dexamethasone and indomethacin removal from contaminated water was also evaluated. The characterization points out the great variety of surface functional groups, promoting different adsorbent-adsorbate interfacial interactions. As a result, the diversified functional groups favor the adsorption by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and π-π interactions. Moreover, the thermal treatment decreased the functionality and oxygenated groups of the carbonized counterpart, increasing the hydrophobic interactions. It also increased the specific area of the material (2–98 m2 g−1) and the average pore size diameter (1.6–4.2 nm). Consequently, the carbonized counterpart exhibits superior adsorption of the model pollutants. The adsorption of dexamethasone occurred in multilayers, whose maximum adsorption capacity obtained experimentally were 11.38 mg g−1 and 22.22 mg g−1 for resin and the carbonized resin. Furthermore, the study concerning the adsorption of indomethacin showed that the indomethacin concentration must be controlled to optimize the adsorption process and avoid precipitation. Finally, the equilibrium studies disclosed an atypical isothermal profile, which is hardly found in the literature. Therefore, the ability to remediate the pollutants demonstrates this novel material potential for future application in water remediation technologies.
