You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge with different plastics on the nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine releasing characteristics and the heavy metals ecological risk of biochar The high calorific value, low ash content and high volatility of the plastic can compensate for the deficiencies of the single pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS), and these properties can improve the quality of the pyrolysis product. However, secondary contaminants may be generated during the co-pyrolysis of sludge and plastics. Plastics contain polluting elements that may also enter sludge, so different plastics may affect the release of N, S, and Cl as well as the ecological risk of heavy metals. In this study, polypropylene (PP), polyamide 6 (PA6) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were added to sludge to analyze the release of N, S and Cl from sludge pyrolysis products by different plastics. An environmental risk assessment was also conducted to evaluate the various forms of heavy metals. The results showed that PP, PA6, and PVC increased the total mass losses of sludge by 16.88%, 6.82% and 9.46%, respectively, inhibiting the release of NH3, CH3Cl, H2S and SO2 harmful gases from sludge. PP and PA6 increased the calorific value of pyrolysis oil and released more aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols. However, PA6 and PVC will increase the release of HCN and HCl, respectively. The presence of plastics enhanced the carbon structure of biochar, with PP and PA6 particularly enriching the pore structure and surface properties of biochar. PA6 and PVC reduced the potential ecological risk of biochar. These results will provide new insights into the co-pyrolysis of sludge and plastics.
