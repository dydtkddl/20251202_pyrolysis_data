You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Properties and development of Ni/YSZ as an anode material in solid oxide fuel cell: A review In recent times, synthesis, development and fabrication of anode component of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) have gained a significant importance, especially after the advent of anode supported SOFC. The function of the anode electrode involves the facilitation of fuel gas diffusion, oxidation of the fuel, transport of electrons and transport of by-product of the electrochemical reaction. Although impressive progress has been made in the development of alternative anode materials with mixed conducting properties and few of the other composite cermets, Ni/YSZ continues to be the most sought after anode for high temperature SOFC applications. Despite of its poor carburization and sulfidation capabilities during the operation of SOFC directly on hydrocarbons, Ni/YSZ continues to be the most opted anode electrode material due to its high catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation, methane reforming, high electronic and ionic conductivity and stability. Present review focuses on the various aspects pertaining to Ni/YSZ as an anode in SOFC. Various factors that influence the ohmic, activation and the concentration polarization contribution of anode while using Ni/YSZ are discussed. Importance of optimizing the composition, microstructure and porosity to minimize the above mentioned polarizations are discussed extensively. Various synthesis methods that are used in the preparation of optimized NiO/YSZ composite powder and the methods that are adopted to fabricate anode component are provided in detail in the article. Information on Ni/YSZ anode failure and strategies to improve the long term stability are also discussed exhaustively. Parameters that influence the carburization and sulfidation of Ni/YSZ while using hydrocarbons as fuel are elaborated in this article and means to minimize the same are also discussed.
