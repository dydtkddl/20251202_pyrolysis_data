You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress on preparation techniques, properties, and applications of tantalum (Ta) coatings: A review Tantalum (Ta) is a refractory metal renowned for its exceptional properties, including a high melting point, excellent high-temperature stability, superior chemical corrosion resistance, and favorable processing characteristics. Tantalum coatings or films, which involve depositing tantalum onto substrate surfaces, have gained significant attention for advanced material protection and functional enhancement. However, due to the scarcity and high cost of tantalum, optimizing its preparation and application is crucial to maximize its benefits. This review comprehensively examines the outstanding properties of tantalum coatings, such as their corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, along with the latest advancements in preparation techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), magnetron sputtering, and plasma spraying. Furthermore, the paper highlights the cutting-edge applications of tantalum coatings in critical fields such as biomedical implants, semiconductor devices, and aerospace components, particularly focusing on breakthroughs enabled by novel technologies like 3D printing. By integrating innovative fabrication methods, tantalum coatings demonstrate remarkable potential in enhancing performance and durability across diverse industrial and scientific domains.
