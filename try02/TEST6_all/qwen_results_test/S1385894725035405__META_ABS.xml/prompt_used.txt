You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution mechanism and pyrolysis strategy of ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers for recycling of the end-of-life photovoltaic modules via PCMW2D and 2D-COS analysis Pyrolysis is a promising method for delamination and recycling of end-of-life (EoL) photovoltaic (PV) modules. To provide theoretical support for process optimization, the thermal evolution of ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) is focused on. Besides the conventional characterization of TG-MS, Py-GC/MS, and in situ DRIFT, perturbation-correlation moving-window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) analysis were used to understand the effect of physical perturbations and the correlation of the functional group variations, respectively. The results indicate that the pyrolysis of EVA involves the melting stage (60–280 ℃), the first weight loss stage (280–430 ℃), and the second weight loss stage (430–530 ℃). At the melting stage, some acetic acid and its derivatives are generated, followed by the emergence and re-formation of the esters. It suggests the phase separation and surface segregation of the polyvinyl acetate segments. The evolution of functional groups at the first weight loss stage is dominated by the rearrangement while the devolatilization plays a minor role. At the substage of 280–350 ℃, it mainly occurs the transformation of ester groups to acetic acid with the release of some secondary small molecules. The decarboxylation into volatiles is delayed by the H-bonds and concentrated at the substage of 350–430 ℃. The second weight loss stage is dominated by the release of alkenes with ∼77 % weight loss. Consequently, a three-step pyrolysis strategy is proposed for PV modules delamination at ∼280 ℃, acetic acid separation at ∼430 ℃, and alkene production at ∼530 ℃.
