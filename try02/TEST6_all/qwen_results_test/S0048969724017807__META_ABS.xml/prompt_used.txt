You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deciphering the behavior and potential mechanism of biochar at different pyrolysis temperatures to alleviate membrane biofouling Biofouling limits applications of membrane technology in wastewater treatment, but dosing additives to membrane tanks is an effective method to alleviate biofouling. In this study, biochar derived from corncob and pyrolyzed at 300, 500, and 700°C was dosed to determine the underlying anti-biofouling mechanism. The effects of the biochar on the membrane properties and foulant behavior were systematically investigated. The results showed that biochar delayed the occurrence of the fouling transition (0.5–3.0 h), and decreased the flux decline rate, thus achieving a higher water flux (3.1–3.7 times of the control group). Biochar altered membrane surface properties, and increased the membrane surface charge, roughness, and hydrophilicity, which all contributed to higher membrane permeability. Moreover, adding biochar reduced the number of foulants in the fouling layer, particularly protein substances. The flux model fit and the XDLVO theory further revealed the mitigating effect of biochar on membrane biofouling. At the initial intermediate-blocking stage, the effect of biochar on membrane fouling was determined by its properties, and adsorption capacity to the foulants, BC500 presented the best mitigation performance. At the later cake-filtration stage, the role of biochar in membrane fouling was strongly associated with protein content in the fouling layer, and the minimum rate of flux decline occurred in BC300. This study promotes the understanding and development of biochar to alleviate membrane biofouling.
