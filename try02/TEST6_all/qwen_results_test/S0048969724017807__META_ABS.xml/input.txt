Deciphering the behavior and potential mechanism of biochar at different pyrolysis temperatures to alleviate membrane biofouling Biofouling limits applications of membrane technology in wastewater treatment, but dosing additives to membrane tanks is an effective method to alleviate biofouling. In this study, biochar derived from corncob and pyrolyzed at 300, 500, and 700°C was dosed to determine the underlying anti-biofouling mechanism. The effects of the biochar on the membrane properties and foulant behavior were systematically investigated. The results showed that biochar delayed the occurrence of the fouling transition (0.5–3.0 h), and decreased the flux decline rate, thus achieving a higher water flux (3.1–3.7 times of the control group). Biochar altered membrane surface properties, and increased the membrane surface charge, roughness, and hydrophilicity, which all contributed to higher membrane permeability. Moreover, adding biochar reduced the number of foulants in the fouling layer, particularly protein substances. The flux model fit and the XDLVO theory further revealed the mitigating effect of biochar on membrane biofouling. At the initial intermediate-blocking stage, the effect of biochar on membrane fouling was determined by its properties, and adsorption capacity to the foulants, BC500 presented the best mitigation performance. At the later cake-filtration stage, the role of biochar in membrane fouling was strongly associated with protein content in the fouling layer, and the minimum rate of flux decline occurred in BC300. This study promotes the understanding and development of biochar to alleviate membrane biofouling.
