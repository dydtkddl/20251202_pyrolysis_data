You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The production of a carbon-coated alumina foam A method for producing ultra light carbon-coated alumina foam with a density of 0.04gcm−3 and 99% porosity has been developed. It was synthesised from an aqueous aluminum nitrate–sucrose solution. The resin formed by heating this solution underwent foaming and set into solid green foam, which was sintered in the temperature range 1073–1873K. The thermogram obtained by heating the green foam in argon showed 62wt% mass loss occurring in three stages. The sintered foam constituted 81wt% of γ-alumina in three-dimensional network and 19wt% of carbon present as coating over the alumina framework. Phase analysis by X-ray diffraction revealed that carbon is in outer phase and γ-alumina is in the inner phase. Surface morphology of this foam, examined by scanning electron microscope showed open, fully interconnected and near spherical pores held together by hexagonal edges with a 300μm average pore size. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed peaks corresponding to carbon, oxygen and aluminum indicating that the foam is free from nitrogen impurity. The surface concentration of carbon is nearly 85wt% while it coating thickness is about 10μm.
