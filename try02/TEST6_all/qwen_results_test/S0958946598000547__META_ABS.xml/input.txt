Prestressed fiber reinforced concrete beams with reduced ratios of shear reinforcement This paper presents an analysis of the influence of prestress and fibers on the shear behaviour of thin-walled I-section beams with reduced shear reinforcement ratio. Reduction of shear reinforcement in prestressed precast beams can make the reinforcement simpler and may increase the productivity in long line precasting beds. The use of short fibers can improve the shear strength and ductility. Nine concrete beams were built (six with prestressing forces) with three different mixtures: without fibers, with steel fibers, and with polypropylene fibers. Shear reinforcement ratios varied from 0 to 0.225% (geometric ratio). It was noted that prestressing increases cracking strength (both in bending and shear), extends the non-cracked area, and makes the compression struts less inclined. In the case of fiber reinforced concrete beams, control of cracking is more effective and consequently deflections are smaller. Ductility is also increased. Both fibers and prestressing reduce stresses in the stirrups and increase shear strength.
