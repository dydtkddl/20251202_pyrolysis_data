You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous removal of microplastics and doxycycline and preparation of novel hollow carbon nanocakes by pyrolysis Microplastics (MPs) pose a significant challenge in terms of their safe disposal and effective utilization. This study aimed to address this issue by employing coagulation and pyrolysis to achieve the simultaneous removal of MPs and doxycycline (DC). Through the addition of nano micro-electrolysis material (nMET) prior to poly ferric sulfate (PS) and polyacrylamide (PAM) coagulation, 92% of DC and 96% of MPs in wastewater were successfully removed. The resulting product from this process is a new type of hollow carbon nanocakes (HCNCs) obtained through pyrolysis. Characterization of the HCNCs reveals that they consist of amorphous carbon, ferric oxide, and zero-valent iron, with a diameter, thickness, specific surface area, and ID/IG of approximately 350 nm, 50 nm, 54.37 m2g−1, and 0.92, respectively. The cavity structure of the HCNCs is formed during the pyrolysis process as CO2 escapes between interstitial compounds. This research not only expands the potential applications of nMET in the environmental field but also presents a method for producing new iron-carbon materials by utilizing waste MPs.
