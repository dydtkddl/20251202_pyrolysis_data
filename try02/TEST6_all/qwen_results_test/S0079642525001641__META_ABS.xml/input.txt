Emergence of deep eutectic solvents (DES): chemistry, preparation, properties, and applications in biorefineries and critical materials The emergence of renewable deep eutectic solvents (DES) as clean and efficient catalysts and solvents has created new opportunities for lignocellulosic biorefineries and critical material sectors, including chemical, energy, pharmaceutical, textile, and hydrometallurgical industries. This review provides an in-depth overview of DES, covering their chemistry, classifications, preparation methods, processing characteristics, and recyclability, while highlighting their unique attributes and industry relevant applications. Emphasis is placed on the integration of DES into advanced biorefinery systems, focusing on their tunable physicochemical and thermodynamic properties for biomass pretreatment and the production of value-added products. The review explores how DES can be tuned for selective dissolution of biomass components and evaluates production and valorization of DES-derived biochemicals, with attention to lignin extraction mechanisms and conversion of biomass into bioproducts and biofuels. Beyond biorefineries, the scope extends to DES applications in electrochemical energy devices, where they serve as electrolytes, synthesis media for electrode materials, and leaching agents in battery recycling. The multifunctional roles of DES in pharmaceutical, hydrometallurgical, and textile sectors are also explored for contributions to sustainable processing. Finally, the review identifies future research directions, outlining benefits, challenges, and knowledge gaps, for continued industrial development.
