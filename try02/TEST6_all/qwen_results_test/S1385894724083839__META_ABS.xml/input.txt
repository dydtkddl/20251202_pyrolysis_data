Steam cracking in a semi-industrial dual fluidized bed reactor: Tackling the challenges in thermochemical recycling of plastic waste Steam cracking is an integral process in the plastic manufacturing industry. Conventional steam crackers are tubular reactors and use fossil-based feedstocks like naphtha and LPG. This work presents steam cracking in a dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactor as an alternative for the direct steam cracking of plastic waste. Experiments were performed on a semi-industrial DFB system using naphtha, clean polyolefins, real-life plastic wastes, and a polyolefin-derived pyrolysis oil. The results show that steam cracking in a DFB is fundamentally equivalent to steam cracking in tubular reactors. Selective production of light olefins and monoaromatics was achieved within a temperature range of 700–825 °C. Naphtha yielded up to 56 % light olefins and 7 % BTXS, with ethylene and BTXS production positively correlating with cracking severity, while C3 and C4 olefins show a negative correlation. These results confirm that the established steam cracking mechanisms also apply to large-scale DFB steam crackers. The yield of light olefins is consistently obtained at approximately 52 % relative to the polyolefin content of the feedstock, regardless of the non-polyolefin content. This highlights the DFB steam cracker’s ability to produce light olefins directly from plastic waste without presorting. However, steam cracking in DFB results in significantly higher CO and CO2 yields than conventional steam cracking, especially with feedstocks containing non-polyolefins like PET and cellulose. Additionally, steam cracking of an olefin-rich pyrolysis oil yields up to 50 % light olefins with minimal coke formation, highlighting the potential in processing plastic waste pyrolysis oils without pretreatment steps such as distillation and hydrotreatment.
