You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam cracking in a semi-industrial dual fluidized bed reactor: Tackling the challenges in thermochemical recycling of plastic waste Steam cracking is an integral process in the plastic manufacturing industry. Conventional steam crackers are tubular reactors and use fossil-based feedstocks like naphtha and LPG. This work presents steam cracking in a dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactor as an alternative for the direct steam cracking of plastic waste. Experiments were performed on a semi-industrial DFB system using naphtha, clean polyolefins, real-life plastic wastes, and a polyolefin-derived pyrolysis oil. The results show that steam cracking in a DFB is fundamentally equivalent to steam cracking in tubular reactors. Selective production of light olefins and monoaromatics was achieved within a temperature range of 700–825 °C. Naphtha yielded up to 56 % light olefins and 7 % BTXS, with ethylene and BTXS production positively correlating with cracking severity, while C3 and C4 olefins show a negative correlation. These results confirm that the established steam cracking mechanisms also apply to large-scale DFB steam crackers. The yield of light olefins is consistently obtained at approximately 52 % relative to the polyolefin content of the feedstock, regardless of the non-polyolefin content. This highlights the DFB steam cracker’s ability to produce light olefins directly from plastic waste without presorting. However, steam cracking in DFB results in significantly higher CO and CO2 yields than conventional steam cracking, especially with feedstocks containing non-polyolefins like PET and cellulose. Additionally, steam cracking of an olefin-rich pyrolysis oil yields up to 50 % light olefins with minimal coke formation, highlighting the potential in processing plastic waste pyrolysis oils without pretreatment steps such as distillation and hydrotreatment.
