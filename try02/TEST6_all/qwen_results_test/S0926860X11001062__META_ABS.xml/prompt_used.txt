You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrotreating of coker light gas oil on Ti-HMS supported heteropolytungstic acid catalysts Ti-HMS substrates were synthesized by using dodecylamine as structure-directing agents. A series of HPW/Ti-HMS catalysts with different Si/Ti ratios, promoted by Ni was prepared using Keggin-type heteropolyacids (H3PW12O40) as active phase precursors. These catalysts were compared with corresponding NiW/HMS catalysts prepared from the traditional precursors (ammonium metatungstate). Prepared supports and catalysts were characterized by small- and wide-angle XRD, N2 physisorption, FT-IR, Raman, DRIFT, TEM, and SEM. Catalytic activity was assessed for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) of coker light gas oil (CLGO) derived from Athabasca bitumen, in a trickle bed reactor at a temperature, pressure, and LHSV of 370°C, 8.8MPa, and 2.0h−1, respectively. The W catalysts prepared from heteropolyacids showed better performance for hydrotreating than their counterparts prepared from traditionally used W ammonium salts. The incorporation of Ti into HMS afforded catalysts that were more active than the Ti-free counterpart, due to the larger number of coordinately unsaturated sites (CUS) of the metal sulfide on Ti-loaded catalysts. Under steady-state conditions, the NiPW/Ti-HMS (20) catalyst with a Si/Ti ratio of 20 was the most active among the catalysts studied due to more uniform distribution of active species.
