You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Breakup mechanisms in air-assisted atomization of highly viscous pyrolysis oils Air-assisted atomization of the sprays produced by injecting different types of highly viscous pyrolysis oils are studied. Different breakup and atomization regimes are characterized using the long distance microscopic imaging technique. The high resolution imaging reveals detailed underlying two-phase interactions in pyrolysis oil injection that are found unlike other conventional liquid fuels. Several cases of droplet size characterization are carried out using the Malvern’s laser diffraction measurements under variable liquid flow rates, atomizing air flow rates and oil preheating temperatures. The time-averaged and high resolution instantaneous images reveal that the highly viscous nature of pyrolysis oils prevent the instability mechanisms from efficiently atomizing the liquid. The present broad set of measured data suggest that the atomization quality of pyrolysis oils can be optimized by applying a combination of liquid preheating and air-assisted atomization. The flow visualizations reveal the transition from ligament-dominated two-phase flow field into fully atomized sprays when proper oil preheating temperatures and sufficient atomizing air flow rates are provided. Visualized observations are quantitatively verified using the droplet size distribution measurements as well as the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) values for several measurement conditions.
