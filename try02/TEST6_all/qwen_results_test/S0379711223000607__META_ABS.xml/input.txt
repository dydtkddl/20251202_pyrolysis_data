Experimental study on the effect of mechanical ventilation on cable tray fires in compartments This study deals with the effect of ventilation flow rate and the ventilation configuration on the behavior of a cable tray fire in a confined and mechanically ventilated enclosure. Results are based on large-scale fire tests performed within the framework of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) PRISME projects. The fire source, identical for all tests, consisted in five horizontal cable trays measuring 3 m in length, stacked vertically and filled with halogen-free flame retardant cable-type, non-powered cables. The installation consists of two rooms connected by an open doorway. Two ventilation configurations were considered with two different arrangements of the inlet and outlet branches. The analysis demonstrates the effects of ventilation flow rate and air intake position on the fire heat release rate (HRR). Decreasing the ventilation flow rate reduces the maximum HRR and delays combustion on the trays, which burn one after the other rather than simultaneously. This result is the consequence of oxygen vitiation near the cable trays, which reduces the horizontal flame spread on each cable tray. The analysis also discusses the phenomenon of low frequency oscillatory behavior of fire in a ventilated enclosure. The results highlight that the conditions of occurrence of oscillations combine two criteria: a low ventilation flow rate to favor the release of unburnt gases and an appropriate configuration of the ventilation air intake to generate ignition of premixed gases.
