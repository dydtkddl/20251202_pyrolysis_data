You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on the effect of mechanical ventilation on cable tray fires in compartments This study deals with the effect of ventilation flow rate and the ventilation configuration on the behavior of a cable tray fire in a confined and mechanically ventilated enclosure. Results are based on large-scale fire tests performed within the framework of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) PRISME projects. The fire source, identical for all tests, consisted in five horizontal cable trays measuring 3 m in length, stacked vertically and filled with halogen-free flame retardant cable-type, non-powered cables. The installation consists of two rooms connected by an open doorway. Two ventilation configurations were considered with two different arrangements of the inlet and outlet branches. The analysis demonstrates the effects of ventilation flow rate and air intake position on the fire heat release rate (HRR). Decreasing the ventilation flow rate reduces the maximum HRR and delays combustion on the trays, which burn one after the other rather than simultaneously. This result is the consequence of oxygen vitiation near the cable trays, which reduces the horizontal flame spread on each cable tray. The analysis also discusses the phenomenon of low frequency oscillatory behavior of fire in a ventilated enclosure. The results highlight that the conditions of occurrence of oscillations combine two criteria: a low ventilation flow rate to favor the release of unburnt gases and an appropriate configuration of the ventilation air intake to generate ignition of premixed gases.
