You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into the hydrogen generation and catalytic mechanism on Co-based nanocomposites derived from pyrolysis of organic metal precursor Hydrogen generation from boron hydride is important for the development of hydrogen economy. Cobalt (Co) element has been widely used in the hydrolysis of boron hydride. Pyrolysis is a common method for materials synthesis in catalytic fields. Herein, Co-based nanocomposites derived from the pyrolysis of organic metal precursors and used for hydrolysis of boron hydride are summarized and discussed. The different precursors consisting of MOF, supported, metal, and metal phosphide precursors are summarized. The catalytic mechanism consisting of dissociation mechanism based on oxidative addition-reduction elimination, pre-activation mechanism, SN2 mechanism, four-membered ring mechanism, and acid-base mechanism is intensively discussed. Finally, conclusions and outlooks are conveyed from the design of high-efficiency catalysts, the characterization of catalyst structure, the enhancement of catalytic activities, the investigation of the catalytic mechanism, and the catalytic stability of active structure. This review can provide guidance for designing high-efficiency catalysts and boosting development of hydrogen economy.
