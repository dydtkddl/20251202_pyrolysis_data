Insights into the hydrogen generation and catalytic mechanism on Co-based nanocomposites derived from pyrolysis of organic metal precursor Hydrogen generation from boron hydride is important for the development of hydrogen economy. Cobalt (Co) element has been widely used in the hydrolysis of boron hydride. Pyrolysis is a common method for materials synthesis in catalytic fields. Herein, Co-based nanocomposites derived from the pyrolysis of organic metal precursors and used for hydrolysis of boron hydride are summarized and discussed. The different precursors consisting of MOF, supported, metal, and metal phosphide precursors are summarized. The catalytic mechanism consisting of dissociation mechanism based on oxidative addition-reduction elimination, pre-activation mechanism, SN2 mechanism, four-membered ring mechanism, and acid-base mechanism is intensively discussed. Finally, conclusions and outlooks are conveyed from the design of high-efficiency catalysts, the characterization of catalyst structure, the enhancement of catalytic activities, the investigation of the catalytic mechanism, and the catalytic stability of active structure. This review can provide guidance for designing high-efficiency catalysts and boosting development of hydrogen economy.
