Efficient removal and reusage of acid soluble oil in waste H2SO4 of isobutane alkylation by low-temperature carbonization process Waste H2SO4 from industrial isobutane alkylation, a hazardous thick liquid with a high concentration of acid soluble oil (ASO) impurities, poses challenges in the regeneration process. Herein, an innovative low-temperature carbonization process was proposed to convert waste H2SO4 into the regenerated concentrated H2SO4 and sulfonated activated carbon materials (SACMs) under mild reaction conditions. The optimal reaction temperature is identified at 423.15 K with the highest total organic carbon (TOC) removal of 90.57%. The high-purity regenerated H2SO4 with a concentration of 95% as a catalyst for isobutane alkylation exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 94.54 research octane number (RON) of the alkylate. SACMs, characterized as a novel porous carbon material with plentiful hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and sulfonic acid functional groups, demonstrate an efficient catalytic activity in the dimerization of lactic acid to produce lactide with a yield of 46.95%. Hopefully, the novel recovery process provides a promising application to optimize the regeneration process of waste H2SO4 from industrial isobutane alkylation.
