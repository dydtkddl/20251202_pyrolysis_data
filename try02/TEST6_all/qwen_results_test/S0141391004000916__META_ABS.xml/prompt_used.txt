You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene over mesoporous and microporous catalysts in a fluidised-bed reactor High density polyethylene (HDPE) was pyrolysed over various catalysts using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. HZSM-5 catalysed degradation resulted in much larger amounts of volatile hydrocarbons compared with degradation over non-zeolitic catalysts (MCM-41 and SAHA). When an HZSM-5 was used as a cracking additive in combination with a non-zeolitic catalyst (MCM-41 and SiO2–Al2O3), the solid mixed catalysts produced less gas with a lower loss of gasoline than HZSM-5. MCM-41 with large mesopores and SAHA with weaker acid sites resulted in a highly olefinic product and gave rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. Both SAHA and MCM-41 materials allow bulky reactions to occur leading to the generation of coke and subsequently deactivation of the catalyst. This paper presents the conversion of polymers to useful hydrocarbons using various cracking catalysts and attempts to provide a basis for optimising the potential benefit of catalytic polymer recycling.
