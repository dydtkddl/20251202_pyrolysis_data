You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lower limit of hydrocarbon generation in source rocks: A case study from the Dongpu Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, East China With the increasing demand for hydrocarbons, exploration tends to be deeper and unconventional resources. However, whether there are the lower limits for exploration depth or thermal maturity (Ro) appears to be particularly essential. It is of considerable significance to determine the lower limit of hydrocarbon generation (LLHG) since this limit can provide guidelines for hydrocarbon potential estimation. According to the mechanisms of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion, five methods are combined to determine and verify the LLHG, whose values can be expressed by LLHG(Ro) and LLHG(H). Source rock samples from the Paleogene Shahejie Formation (Es) in the Dongpu Depression were taken as an example to determine the LLHG, and then controlling factors of the LLHG were discussed. LLHG(Ro) values for Es range from 3.23% to 3.97% (average 3.71%) and LLHG(H) values range from 5244 m to 5525 m (average 5433 m). Regionally, LLHG values display obvious differences between the northern and southern of depression. LLHG values in the north are roughly larger than those in the south. In the northern depression, the LLHG(Ro) values are ranging from 3.61% to 3.97% (average 3.81%) and LLHG(H) values are ranging from 5415 m to 5545 m (average 5488 m). However, in the southern part, the LLHG(Ro) values range from 3.20% to 3.74% (average 3.48%) and the LLHG(H) values range from 5265 m to 5375 m (average 5278 m). The main controlling factors for LLHG diversity between the north and the south of depression are organic matter (OM) type and abundance, formation temperature and pressure.
