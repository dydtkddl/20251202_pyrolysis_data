You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Additive manufacturing of nickel-based superalloys: A state-of-the-art review on process-structure-defect-property relationship Fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) has significantly grown to fabricate Nickel-based superalloys with design freedom across multiple length scales. Several phenomena such as feedstock/energy source/melt pool interactions, solidification and phase transformations occur during fusion-based AM processes of Nickel-based superalloys, which determine the ultimate microstructure and mechanical performance of the built parts. In this review, we elaborate a comprehensive discussion on AM Nickel-based superalloys and influential factors including feedstock characteristics (powder morphology, chemistry, contamination, flowability, recycling) and AM processing (parameters, and powder spreading/wall/balling/spattering effects) on their microstructure (micro-segregation, phases formations and grain structures), defect generation (sub-surface/internal defects, microcracks, surface roughness, and residual stress). Furthermore, the mechanical properties of AM Nickel-based superalloys such as tensile, creep and fatigue at room/elevated temperatures are analyzed in accordance with the initial, and post processing effects. Additionally, the commonly utilized modeling approaches in literature to predict the microstructure and mechanical behavior of these alloys are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and mitigation approaches for future research are identified considering the gaps in the AM Nickel-based superalloys.
