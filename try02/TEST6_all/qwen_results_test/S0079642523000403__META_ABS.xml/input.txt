Additive manufacturing of nickel-based superalloys: A state-of-the-art review on process-structure-defect-property relationship Fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) has significantly grown to fabricate Nickel-based superalloys with design freedom across multiple length scales. Several phenomena such as feedstock/energy source/melt pool interactions, solidification and phase transformations occur during fusion-based AM processes of Nickel-based superalloys, which determine the ultimate microstructure and mechanical performance of the built parts. In this review, we elaborate a comprehensive discussion on AM Nickel-based superalloys and influential factors including feedstock characteristics (powder morphology, chemistry, contamination, flowability, recycling) and AM processing (parameters, and powder spreading/wall/balling/spattering effects) on their microstructure (micro-segregation, phases formations and grain structures), defect generation (sub-surface/internal defects, microcracks, surface roughness, and residual stress). Furthermore, the mechanical properties of AM Nickel-based superalloys such as tensile, creep and fatigue at room/elevated temperatures are analyzed in accordance with the initial, and post processing effects. Additionally, the commonly utilized modeling approaches in literature to predict the microstructure and mechanical behavior of these alloys are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and mitigation approaches for future research are identified considering the gaps in the AM Nickel-based superalloys.
