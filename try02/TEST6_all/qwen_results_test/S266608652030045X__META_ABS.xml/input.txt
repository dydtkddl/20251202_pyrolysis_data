A review on synthesis, characterization and potential biological applications of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been recognized in numerous fields including nanobiotechnology, biomedical engineering, and many other fields for its inestimable applications. Superparamagnetic property and the smaller size of SPIONs are the major reasons for its utilization in various fields. In this review, the overall view on work done so far on SPIONS is detailed. Where, it started with different methods of synthesis of SPIONs including various types physical (such as gas-phase deposition, pulsed laser ablation, power ball milling), chemical (chemical co-precipitation, micro-emulsions, hydrothermal synthesis) and biological methods (using bacteria and plant) and are also elaborated. Its properties and characteristics are detailed. The formulation of SPIONs into drug-laden nanocarrier for exhibiting targeted drug delivery and its use in cancer treatment as hyperthermia is emphasised. Its various other applications consist of radiation therapy, environmental remediation, tissue engineering etc., which are also elaborated.
