You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bench-scale assessment of combustion toxicity—A critical analysis of current protocols The toxicity of fire effluents is not a material property but a function of both the material and the fire environment. To be meaningful, it is essential that toxicity results should relate to the end-use fire situation. This paper reviews current fire effluent toxicity tests, their relevance to fire, and the ways of assessing and applying their results to reduce fire hazards. There are a large number of different methods for determination of the toxic potency of fire effluents from materials or products. These different methods yield apparently inconsistent data because they represent different fire scenarios; measure product yields either as a function of material flammability or independent of it; base the toxicity assessment on the concentrations of different species; or use animal exposure to generate an overall estimate of toxic potency without knowledge of the relative contributions of the chemical species. The drive for internationally harmonised methods for assessment of combustion toxicity, through adoption of international standards, such as those of ISO, provides the framework for meaningful and appropriate use of toxic potency data in the assessment of fire hazard. As structures and means of transportation become larger and more complex, there is movement away from the more traditional methods of ensuring fire safety by prescriptive codes, towards fire risk assessments and engineering solutions. Reliable rate of heat release, fire effluent toxicity and smoke generation data are all essential elements of such an assessment.
