You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on liquid fuel produced from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste The continuous growth of plastic waste and the depletion of fossil energy have seriously affected the environment and human live. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis is a promising technique for turning organic wastes, like plastic wastes, into products with additional value. The present status of plastic pyrolysis with microwave assistance to produce liquid fuel with high-value addition is reviewed in this paper. The basic principle of microwave radiation is introduced. The advantages and factors of employing microwaves to assist pyrolyze plastic wastes are discussed. Compared with traditional pyrolysis, microwave assisted pyrolysis can uniformly heat substances, achieve rapid and selective heating, and has the advantages of high production efficiency and low energy consumption. Microwave power, temperature, catalyst and microwave absorbers are the main influencing factors of microwave assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste. In addition, the application of machine learning in microwave pyrolysis of plastic wastes are summarized, as well as the application of pyrolysis oil in the field of energy and materials. The primary challenges and limitations of microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic wastes are also covered, and this method offered a fresh concept for the efficient use of plastic wastes. In the future, the existing solid waste should be used to develop new efficient catalysts and microwave absorbers, and further explore the co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass to improve the efficiency of plastic pyrolysis and product quality. This review is helpful for subsequent related research in liquid production from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic wastes.
