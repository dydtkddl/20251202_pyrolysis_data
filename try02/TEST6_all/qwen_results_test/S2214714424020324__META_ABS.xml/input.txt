Efficient activation of UV-driven ozonation using ultrasonics for LDPE decomposition Microplastic contamination remains a pervasive environmental issue, with the development of effective large-scale removal technologies still lacking. This study proposed O3/US/UV oxidation in water as a viable alternative for addressing microplastic pollution. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), recognized for its extensive application and resistance relative to other microplastics, was chosen as the representative target and its changes in physical and chemical properties were assessed using multiple techniques. The O3/US/UV system demonstrated superior performance compared to single and dual systems through the synergistic generation of reactive radicals. The primary reactive species generated in the system was e−, followed by O2 •−, 1O2, and •OH. LDPE appeared to lose its original properties, which was evident by changes in color, of its being hydrophobic, cracks, enlargement, and surface functional group changes. The carbonyl index of O3/US/UV-treated LDPE was 3.84 and 1.32 times greater than that of the O3 alone and O3/US samples, respectively. In addition, scale-up experiments aligned with the batch experiments, as the O3/US/UV system surpassed the sequential system. The germination of three types of edible seedlings indicated that the treated water had negligible toxic effects, as it resulted in no chemical residues following oxidation. A recommended release of <50 % treated water should prevent harm to sensitive species. The findings indicated that the O3/US/UV system was an effective and sustainable approach for treating water contaminated with microplastics, contributing to the advancement of cleaner water treatment solutions.
