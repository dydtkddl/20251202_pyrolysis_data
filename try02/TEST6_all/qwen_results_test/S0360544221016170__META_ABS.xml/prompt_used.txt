You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Inhibitory and synergistic effects on thermal behaviour and char characteristics during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and single-use plastics The co-pyrolytic behaviour of single-use plastics (Polystyrene, Low-density polyethylene) and Eucalyptus biomass was investigated at variable temperatures (300, 400, 500, and 600 °C) and the effects of their interactions on the characteristics of solid chars were also studied. The variation in thermal profiles of ‘Δ Mass loss%’ showed the inhibitory and synergistic effects of plastics on the biomass degradation, resulting in higher and lower yields of char composite, respectively. The blend containing polystyrene exhibited the highest synergistic (Δ M ≈ 15.1) and inhibitory (Δ M ≈ - 4) effects. The thermal kinetics of blends also indicated the presence of both the effects through relatively higher and lower apparent activation energies compared to the calculated, before and during the degradation of plastics. Despite low fixed carbon contents and high volatile matter, polymer-coated char composites had higher fuel value indices (36–136%), energy yields (1–26%) and calorific values (15–21%), relative to biochar. After the complete degradation of plastics, char composites exhibited higher values of electrical conductivity (2–40%), surface area (15–64%), and cation exchange capacity (5–19%). These properties advocate the flexibility of char composites' applicability as solid fuel or soil amender depending on the optimized conditions of co-pyrolysis.
