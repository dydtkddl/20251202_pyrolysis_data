You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic carbon-carbon bond cleavage and carbon-element bond formation give new life for polyolefins as biodegradable surfactants Catalytic methods that introduce functional groups via carbon–carbon bond cleavage steps have typically been limited to moieties activated by strain or by directing groups, with few transformations engaging the bonds of only sp 3 -hybridized carbon atoms in saturated hydrocarbons. Here, we report the conversion of catenated carbon chains in polyolefins, which currently represent >50% of discarded plastics, into shorter aliphatic alkylaluminum species via a sequence of zirconation via C–H bond activation, β-alkyl elimination for carbon–carbon bond cleavage, and heterobimetallic alkyl group exchange for carbon–aluminum bond formation. The versatility of aliphatic alkylaluminum species is exemplified by their subsequent conversion into high-value fatty acids or alcohols, which have applications as biodegradable surfactants and detergents. A technoeconomic analysis indicates that fatty alcohols produced from discarded polyolefins are cost competitive with conventional syntheses. Thus, this process could ameliorate economic and environmental challenges of the plastic-waste crisis.
