Transition metal-free Me3SiCl synthesis of α-AlH3 with enhanced thermal stability via dual lithium hydride templating The insufficient thermal stability of aluminum hydride (AlH3) poses a critical challenge for its application in high-energy solid propellants. To address this instability, we develop a transition metal-free synthesis strategy using methyltrichlorosilane (Me3SiCl) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) to produce stabilized α-AlH3. Systematic optimization reveals a 13-fold thermal stability enhancement in Me3SiCl-synthesized AlH3 (0.14 % mass loss at 403K over 30 min) compared to conventional AlCl3-based methods (1.83 % mass loss). Combined computational and experimental analyses identify chlorine impurities as minor destabilizers through both electronic and structural effects. We demonstrate that polymeric AlH3 maintains stability via extended lattice interactions and kinetic trapping of metastable states, a dual-agent system (LiAlH4/LiBH4) further enables synthesis of pure α-AlH3 through synergistic mechanisms involving mixed-hydride complexes, lithium-ion templated crystallization, and coordination-ionic polymerization. These insights establish new design principles for engineering thermally stable metal hydrides with industrial relevance.
