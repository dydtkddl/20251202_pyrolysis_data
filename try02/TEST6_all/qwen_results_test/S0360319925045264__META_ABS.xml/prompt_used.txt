You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transition metal-free Me3SiCl synthesis of α-AlH3 with enhanced thermal stability via dual lithium hydride templating The insufficient thermal stability of aluminum hydride (AlH3) poses a critical challenge for its application in high-energy solid propellants. To address this instability, we develop a transition metal-free synthesis strategy using methyltrichlorosilane (Me3SiCl) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) to produce stabilized α-AlH3. Systematic optimization reveals a 13-fold thermal stability enhancement in Me3SiCl-synthesized AlH3 (0.14 % mass loss at 403K over 30 min) compared to conventional AlCl3-based methods (1.83 % mass loss). Combined computational and experimental analyses identify chlorine impurities as minor destabilizers through both electronic and structural effects. We demonstrate that polymeric AlH3 maintains stability via extended lattice interactions and kinetic trapping of metastable states, a dual-agent system (LiAlH4/LiBH4) further enables synthesis of pure α-AlH3 through synergistic mechanisms involving mixed-hydride complexes, lithium-ion templated crystallization, and coordination-ionic polymerization. These insights establish new design principles for engineering thermally stable metal hydrides with industrial relevance.
