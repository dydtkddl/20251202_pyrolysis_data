You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive Review based on the synthesis, properties, morphology, functionalization, and potential applications of transition metals nitrides Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are emerging as versatile materials with significant potential across various fields due to their unique properties and functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of TMNs, covering their crystal structure, stability, and the unique advantages they offer. TMNs exhibit superior catalytic activity, lower sintering sensitivity, and high selectivity, while operating at reduced temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have addressed their diverse properties, including electronic, optical, vibrational, plasmonic, mechanical, bulk, magnetic, structural, and morphological characteristics. The review categorizes TMNs into different types: unitary, binary, ternary, and quaternary nitrides, and explores various synthesis methods such as ammonolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrodeposition, and pyrolysis. Additionally, it discusses the classification of TMNs into single metal-source nitrides and composite metal-source nitrides, highlighting materials like FeN, CoN, and TiN. Similarly, the functionalization strategies are also examined, covering boron-based, cyanide-based, and graphene-based TMNs etc. among others. The review evaluates the morphology of TMNs, including nanoflowers, nanospheres, and nanowires, and their influence on performance. Finally, the applications of TMNs are explored in detail, focusing on their performance in photocatalytic reactions (hydrogen (H2) evolution, oxygen (O2) evolution, overall water splitting, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, and degradation), electrocatalysis (H2 evolution reaction, O2 evolution reaction, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction), energy storage (batteries and supercapacitors), and solar cells. This synthesis of material highlights the extensive use and future promise of TMNs in enhancing technical advancements. This study aims to provide an extensive foundation that covers every aspect of TMNs, with a particular focus on their many functional features, unique morphologies, and dimensions. Our comprehensive approach provides readers with an in-depth understanding of TMNs properties and potential applications, setting our review apart through its extensive coverage and detailed analysis. This thorough overview highlights the enormous potential of TMNs to drive advancements in various technological and scientific fields. Novelty of this study The novelty of this review on TMNs lies in its comprehensive and multidimensional approach, presenting a detailed exploration of all critical aspects of such materials. The review offers a broad platform covering their diverse morphologies, structural types, and synthesis techniques, while emphasizing their extensive range of functionalities. Notably, it integrates an analysis on the crystalline structures of TMNs, their varied properties, and dimensionality (from 0D to 3D), which are key factors in determining their catalytic performance, stability, and applications in various fields. The review organizes TMNs into unitary, binary, ternary, and quaternary nitrides, emphasizing the compositional and structural differences that directly affect their characteristics and applications. This work, for the first time, illustrates the benefits of certain functional units within TMNs, such as boron and platinum, and provides insights regarding how various synthesis processes facilitate material modification. Additionally, the review comprehensively explores the diverse morphologies of TMNs and their impact on catalytic performance and stability. By systematically categorizing TMN structures such as nanoflowers, nanospheres, nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, quantum dots, honeycomb, yolk-shell, and hierarchical structures, it demonstrates how these morphologies enhance surface area, electrons transfer, and catalytic selectivity. Moreover, the review provides extensive analysis of the applications of TMNs in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and energy storage technologies. It explores into their roles in H2 and O2 evolution reactions, overall water splitting, H2O2 production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and their use in advanced energy storage devices like batteries, supercapacitors, and solar cells. This comprehensive analysis highlights the versatility and potential of TMNs in advancing breakthroughs in clean energy and environmental technology. Overall, the review provides an inclusive, detailed perspective that distinguishes it from previous studies.
