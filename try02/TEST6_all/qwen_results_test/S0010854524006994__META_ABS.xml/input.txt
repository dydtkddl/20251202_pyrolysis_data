A comprehensive Review based on the synthesis, properties, morphology, functionalization, and potential applications of transition metals nitrides Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are emerging as versatile materials with significant potential across various fields due to their unique properties and functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of TMNs, covering their crystal structure, stability, and the unique advantages they offer. TMNs exhibit superior catalytic activity, lower sintering sensitivity, and high selectivity, while operating at reduced temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have addressed their diverse properties, including electronic, optical, vibrational, plasmonic, mechanical, bulk, magnetic, structural, and morphological characteristics. The review categorizes TMNs into different types: unitary, binary, ternary, and quaternary nitrides, and explores various synthesis methods such as ammonolysis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrodeposition, and pyrolysis. Additionally, it discusses the classification of TMNs into single metal-source nitrides and composite metal-source nitrides, highlighting materials like FeN, CoN, and TiN. Similarly, the functionalization strategies are also examined, covering boron-based, cyanide-based, and graphene-based TMNs etc. among others. The review evaluates the morphology of TMNs, including nanoflowers, nanospheres, and nanowires, and their influence on performance. Finally, the applications of TMNs are explored in detail, focusing on their performance in photocatalytic reactions (hydrogen (H2) evolution, oxygen (O2) evolution, overall water splitting, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, and degradation), electrocatalysis (H2 evolution reaction, O2 evolution reaction, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction), energy storage (batteries and supercapacitors), and solar cells. This synthesis of material highlights the extensive use and future promise of TMNs in enhancing technical advancements. This study aims to provide an extensive foundation that covers every aspect of TMNs, with a particular focus on their many functional features, unique morphologies, and dimensions. Our comprehensive approach provides readers with an in-depth understanding of TMNs properties and potential applications, setting our review apart through its extensive coverage and detailed analysis. This thorough overview highlights the enormous potential of TMNs to drive advancements in various technological and scientific fields. Novelty of this study The novelty of this review on TMNs lies in its comprehensive and multidimensional approach, presenting a detailed exploration of all critical aspects of such materials.
