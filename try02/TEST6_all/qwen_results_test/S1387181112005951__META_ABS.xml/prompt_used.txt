You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrathin highly porous alumina films prepared by alucone ABC molecular layer deposition (MLD) Highly structured porous alumina thin films have many practical uses, including membrane applications and catalyst encapsulation. One route to synthesizing these films that offers exceptional control over film thickness to several angstroms starts with the molecular layer deposition (MLD) of an aluminum alkoxide (alucone) film. Oxidizing the alucone film removes the organic component and produces the desired nanoporous alumina. The pore size can be controlled by selection of the length of the carbon chain in the polymer film. In this study, 500nm silica nanoparticles were coated with 10–40cycles of alucone using a three-step ABC MLD process. Trimethylaluminum, ethanolamine, and maleic anhydride were used as precursors. The organic component of the alucone films was removed in air by calcination at elevated temperature or in water at room temperature. It is shown that the pore size of the porous films can be increased from 0.6 to 0.8nm by depositing an alucone film having longer carbon chains. Film surface area, composition, thickness, and pore size were measured, confirming that the ABC MLD process can produce high quality porous alumina films and provide a pathway to tune nanopore size in these films.
