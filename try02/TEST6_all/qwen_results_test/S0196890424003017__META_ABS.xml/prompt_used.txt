You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Aqueous byproducts from biomass wet thermochemical processing: Valorization into fuels, chemicals, fertilizers, and biomaterials Thermochemical pretreatments are employed prior to energy, chemicals, and fuels production from biomass. Wet thermochemical processes (WTCP) are treatments used to modify biomass properties in water as the primary solvent, with or without added reactants/catalysts. WTCP includes hot water extraction, steam explosion, hydrothermal liquefaction, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), and supercritical water gasification. WTCP also includes processes that add chemicals to reduce reaction time and improve efficiency, i.e., organosolv, alkali, and low acid pretreatment. Operational parameters in WTCP are usually selected to optimize the yields of sugars after enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting solids and biogas from the pretreated solids, or to ensure that hydrochar (e.g., from HTC) performs adequately in environmental applications. However, a key byproduct from WTCPs is an aqueous fraction (rich in nutrients, hemicellulose-derived sugars, and chemicals) often disposed of as waste. The necessity of resource conservation and proper management and the need to make WTCP-based biorefineries economically and environmentally sound require using all the byproducts of biomass processing. Options for downstream conversion of the WTCPs' aqueous byproducts are dispersed in the literature. Thus, this paper aims to put together works that report the parameters of WTCPs that allowed removing hemicellulose-derived fractions and nutrients from biomass (either partially or almost entirely), the yields and properties of this aqueous byproduct, methods of characterization, current and expected uses, and the challenges for scaling up WTCPs and using the aqueous stream. The paper focuses on expected and existing methods that allow the valorization of the aqueous fraction and reduce wastes within a circular bioeconomy framework.
