You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave‑assisted pyrolysis: A review of tailored carbon materials and scale‑up challenges Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) has emerged as a transformative method to synthesize high-value carbon materials from diverse waste feedstocks, offering rapid heating rates (up to 330 °C/s) and potentially reducing the process’s activation energy. This review systematically evaluates MAP-derived solid carbon products such as biochar, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon dots, and carbon onions (CNOs), highlighting their tailored properties for advanced applications. Key innovations include biochar with a BET surface area of 419 m²/g for NH₃ adsorption (66.6 % removal efficiency), activated carbon supercapacitors achieving 48.2 Wh/kg energy density, and nitrogen-doped CNTs with oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Despite these advances, technical challenges such as non-uniform temperature distribution, material compatibility in scaled reactors, and energy efficiency trade-offs continue to hinder industrial adoption. This work identifies pathways to optimize microwave parameters such as frequency modulation, and proposes recommendations for temperature measurement techniques. Notably, this article outlines potential practical strategies that offer a path to bridge the gap between laboratory-scale insights and the demands of industrial-scale implementation, positioning MAP as a sustainable platform for carbon material synthesis.
