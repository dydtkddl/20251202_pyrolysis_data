You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam gasification of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with CaO in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier for enriching H2 in syngas with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used as packaging and textile materials. Although PET bottles recycling is mature in many countries, steam gasification could be a solution to recover valuable products from end-of-life PET. CaO has been investigated as an absorbent to capture CO2 and improve H2 production in gasification but mostly it was analyzed as an individual effect. As the main novelty, this work studied not only the individual effect of temperature, steam/PET ratio and CaO/PET ratio on gas products, tars, and char but also the combined interaction of them on gas yields using response surface methodology in PET steam gasification with CaO. The experimental work was conducted in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier and mathematical models were fitted with considering all significant terms. The results showed that H2 yield was doubled at 800 °C but increasing by 44% at 750 °C when the CaO/PET ratio raised from 0 to 2.0. Thus, temperature, CaO, and their interaction had significant effect on H2 yield, which was also reflected by the P-values calculated from the coefficients of the mathematical models. Tar analysis showed that benzene accounted for 80 wt% in tar products and adding CaO can reduce benzene by 34%. However, CO2 increased with adding CaO at temperatures of 700 °C – 800 °C implying that CaO mainly functioned as a catalyst instead of an absorbent. The models fitted well in R 2 and model validations with non-model-fitting points. Therefore, the models can be applied for the prediction of gas product yield in the studied range.
