Graphene oxide/cellulose aerogels nanocomposite: Preparation, pyrolysis, and application for electromagnetic interference shielding Hybrid aerogels consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and cellulose were prepared via a solution mixing–regeneration–freeze drying process. The presence of GO affected the micromorphology of the hybrid aerogels, and a self-assembly behavior of cellulose was observed after the incorporation of GO. Moreover, there is no remarkable modification in the crystallinity index and thermal stability after the insertion of GO. After the reduction of GO in the hybrid aerogels by l-ascorbic acid and the subsequent pyrolysis of the aerogels, the resultant displays some interesting characteristics, including good electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capacity (SE total =58.4dB), high electrical conductivity (19.1Sm−1), hydrophobicity, and fire resistance, which provide an opportunity for some advanced applications such as EMI protection, electrochemical devices, water-proofing agents, and fire retardants. Moreover, this work possibly helps to facilitate the development of both cellulose and GO-based materials and expand their application scope.
