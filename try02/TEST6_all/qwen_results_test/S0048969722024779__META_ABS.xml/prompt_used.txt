You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable valorization of styrofoam and CO2 into syngas Plastic is a versatile material broadly used in a variety of industries. However, the current disposal practices for plastic wastes (incineration/landfilling) add the hazardous materials into the environment. To offer a sustainable valorization platform for plastic waste, this study adopted the catalytic pyrolysis process using CO2 as a co-feedstock. A model plastic waste collected from a seaport was waste buoy (WB), which has been widely used in fishing industry. Prior to the pyrolysis tests, the exact type of plastic in WB and the thermolytic characteristics of WB were examined. Since the WB was made of polystyrene, it was mainly converted into styrene monomer (styrene), dimer (diphenyl-1-butene), and trimer (2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene) from pyrolysis of WB. To further valorize/detoxify styrene derivatives into value-added syngas, catalytic pyrolysis of WB was practiced using the Ni-based catalysts (2/5/10 wt% Ni/SiO2). The yield of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis process of WB was more than one magnitude higher comparing to that from the non-catalytic one. H2 formation also increased as catalyst loading increased. When flow gas was switched from inert gas to CO2, CO gas formation was enhanced due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and styrene derivatives over Ni catalysts. Syngas (H2/CO) formation under the CO2 condition was 5 times higher in comparison to the N2 condition in catalytic pyrolyses of WB with 10 wt% Ni/SiO2. CO2 also effectively suppressed coke deposition on a Ni catalyst. This study proposes a sustainable valorization and disposal platform for used plastic waste and greenhouse gas (CO2), converting them into value-added fuel.
