Cellulase immobilization to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass: An all-inclusive review Cellulase-mediated lignocellulosic biorefinery plays a crucial role in the production of high-value biofuels and chemicals, with enzymatic hydrolysis being an essential component. The advent of cellulase immobilization has revolutionized this process, significantly enhancing the efficiency, stability, and reusability of cellulase enzymes. This review offers a thorough analysis of the fundamental principles underlying immobilization, encompassing various immobilization approaches such as physical adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, and cross-linking. Furthermore, it explores a diverse range of carrier materials, including inorganic, organic, and hybrid/composite materials. The review also focuses on emerging approaches like multi-enzyme co-immobilization, oriented immobilization, immobilized enzyme microreactors, and enzyme engineering for immobilization. Additionally, it delves into novel carrier technologies like 3D printing carriers, stimuli-responsive carriers, artificial cellulosomes, and biomimetic carriers. Moreover, the review addresses recent obstacles in cellulase immobilization, including molecular-level immobilization mechanism, diffusion limitations, loss of cellulase activity, cellulase leaching, and considerations of cost-effectiveness and scalability. The knowledge derived from this review is anticipated to catalyze the evolution of more efficient and sustainable biocatalytic systems for lignocellulosic biomass conversion, representing the current state-of-the-art in cellulase immobilization techniques.
