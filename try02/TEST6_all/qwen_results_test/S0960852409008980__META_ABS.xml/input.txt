Effects of the reforming reagents and fuel species on tar reforming reaction In this study, using wood chips and polyethylene (PE) as fuels, the effects of air and/or steam as reagents on the tar reforming were clarified quantitatively with a simulated gasifier/reformer apparatus of a two-staged gasification process. The results show that when only steam or air was supplied into the reformer, the tar residual rate (defined as the ratio of the tar amount in the reformed gas to the tar amount in the pyrolysis gas) and the carbon particulate concentration in both reformed gases produced from pyrolysis gases of wood chips and PE decreased with the increase of the steam ratio (H2O/C, 0–1.0) or the air ratio (ER, 0–0.30). Supplying steam into the reformer to suppress carbon particulate formation for PE pyrolysis gas is more effective than for wood chips pyrolysis gas. Comparing with the results of steam only reforming, the effect of air supply on reduction of the tar residual rate was more significant, while that on suppression of carbon particulate formation was smaller.
