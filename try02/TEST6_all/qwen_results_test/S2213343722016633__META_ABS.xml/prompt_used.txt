You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphitic carbon nitride thin films for light-induced photocatalysis in a slit geometry microreactor A combination of a photocatalysis and a micro-flow technology provides a highly capable tool for the design and utilisation of functional thin films. Here, they are represented by graphitic carbon nitride films, potentially used for photo-oxidations in environmental chemistry or for hydrogen evolution by water splitting. The optimised synthesis involves a study of the role of monomers, solvents, calcination temperatures, particle size, etc., in respect of the achieved photocatalytic activity. Films were prepared from the mixture of milled powder catalysts and a binder, dried, and subjected to post-processing treatments (post annealing, plasma application). The intended functionality was assessed in two types of reactions, photo-oxidation of a fluorescent dye, Rhodamine B, and photo-oxidation of a common antibiotic, Tetracycline. The performance was compared for the bulk catalyst, and for the thin film. In either case, the same part of light spectrum, concentrations, and other conditions were applied. However, for the thin films, a special experimental setup was utilised. It had the appearance of a micro-flow apparatus designed as a slit geometry photo-microreactor. Comparison of the two different reaction systems revealed the advantages of the thin film catalyst, which was immobilised directly on the photo-microreactor wall. The specific rate constant was more than 50 times higher in this arrangement for both model reactants. In addition, thin films of g-C3N4 were stable and well adherent during the microreactor tests with the repetitive reaction cycles. Plasma treatment considerably increased the hydrophilicity of the dried thin films, which resulted in their substantially higher photoactivity.
