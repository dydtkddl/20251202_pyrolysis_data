You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fire behavior of lead-containing PMMA based Kyowaglas In the present work, the flammability of Kyowaglas is characterized experimentally. Kyowaglas is a lead-based composite used in glove boxes of nuclear facilities as a biological protection against radiation. It consists of 70%wt PMMA (Poly(Methyl Methacrylate)) and 30%wt leaded compounds. The aim of the study is to understand the role and impact of lead during the combustion of Kyowaglas in order to deepen knowledge of its thermal and fire behavior. A comparative study between Kyowaglas and virgin PMMA is conducted to better understand the effect of lead on the combustion process of these materials. Fire behavior is studied using cone calorimeter, pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis. At different stages of cone calorimeter test, the samples and residues were examined and characterized using different experimental techniques like microscopy, spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and calorimetry. Thermal analysis data show that lead seems to slightly accelerate the decomposition of PMMA under inert atmosphere. However, it confers significant thermal stability during a cone test due to the accumulation of lead on the surface of the sample. As the Kyowaglas burns, metallic lead is formed and accumulated at the top surface slowing down the heat transfer. At the end of the cone calorimeter test, lead oxide beads start to form on the surface of the residue due to the oxidation of metallic lead.
