Fire behavior of lead-containing PMMA based Kyowaglas In the present work, the flammability of Kyowaglas is characterized experimentally. Kyowaglas is a lead-based composite used in glove boxes of nuclear facilities as a biological protection against radiation. It consists of 70%wt PMMA (Poly(Methyl Methacrylate)) and 30%wt leaded compounds. The aim of the study is to understand the role and impact of lead during the combustion of Kyowaglas in order to deepen knowledge of its thermal and fire behavior. A comparative study between Kyowaglas and virgin PMMA is conducted to better understand the effect of lead on the combustion process of these materials. Fire behavior is studied using cone calorimeter, pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis. At different stages of cone calorimeter test, the samples and residues were examined and characterized using different experimental techniques like microscopy, spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and calorimetry. Thermal analysis data show that lead seems to slightly accelerate the decomposition of PMMA under inert atmosphere. However, it confers significant thermal stability during a cone test due to the accumulation of lead on the surface of the sample. As the Kyowaglas burns, metallic lead is formed and accumulated at the top surface slowing down the heat transfer. At the end of the cone calorimeter test, lead oxide beads start to form on the surface of the residue due to the oxidation of metallic lead.
