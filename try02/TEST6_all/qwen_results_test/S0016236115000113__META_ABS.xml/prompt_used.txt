You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct liquefaction of lower-rank coals and biocoals with magnetically separable catalysts as a sustainable route to fuels Direct coal liquefaction (DCL) encompasses the catalytic conversion of coal by hydrogen and high temperatures in presence of a solvent and can be used to produce transportation fuels on a commercial scale. DCL economy suffers from its severe reaction conditions (up to 20MPa hydrogen pressure and reaction temperatures up to 728K). Industrial catalysts are of low activity since only cheap disposable iron-based catalysts are used. We tested two groups of highly active low-rank coals, one “bitumen-rich” brown coal with a high aliphatic content and a biocoal from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of biomass employing novel catalysts. The oil yield (up to 71wt.%) and the oil quality from the direct brown coal liquefaction with a small catalyst amount of nanostructured Co/SiO2 or Co/SiO2/Fe3O4 showed promising results for further upscaling. The liquefaction of the biocoal with low amounts of Ni/TiO2 (oil yields up to 42wt.%) proved to be a meaningful perspective especially for environmental concerns. Furthermore, Co/SiO2/Fe3O4 and Ni/TiO2 could be recovered and recycled by magnetic gradient, with only small decreases in their catalytic activity.
