You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improving mesophilic anaerobic digestion of compostable packaging through efficient and versatile thermo-alkaline pre-treatment In the current European regulatory context, which requires its Member States to collect biowaste separately with a view to its organic recovery, the co-processing of compostable food packaging with biowaste by mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) offers the dual opportunity of promoting its conversion into biogas while reducing plastic contamination of the environment. However, most packaging items on the market - particularly those made from poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene succinate (PBS) - show poor biodegradability under mesophilic AD conditions. To overcome this limitation, thermo-alkaline pre-treatments conditions were carried out to hydrolyze the most resistant polymers and improve their digestibility during AD. As PBAT is the most recalcitrant, the pre-treatment conditions were first optimized using pure PBAT, before extending the application to various compostable commercial items, including bags and coffee capsules. Optimal pre-treatment conditions (3 M KOH at 70 °C for 4 h) allowed for the effective solubilization of all the items tested. As a result, Biochemical Methane Potentials (BMP) were significantly increased with improvements ranging from 2 to 3 times for bags and 1.4 to 17 times for coffee capsules, even though they contained PBAT, PLA or PBS. By sufficiently reducing the molecular weight of recalcitrant polymers so that they can be assimilated by microorganisms, this pre-treatment has demonstrated its ability to enable their biodegradation in mesophilic AD. This versatile and universal pre-treatment approach offers a promising solution recovering biowaste with compostable packaging by converting them into methane while improving the quality of AD digestates.
