You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires over clays for high quality pyrolysis products This paper aims to evaluate the effect of low-cost clays (kaolin with different particle size and montmorillonite (MTT) modified with ZnCl2 and HCl) as catalysts on the pyrolysis products from waste tire. The results show that clays can improve the quality and yield of pyrolysis products. Different particle size and modification conditions have significant influence on the distribution and component of pyrolysis products. Compared with blank group, the content of combustible gas (including CH4 of 56.35%, H2 of 35.67% and CO of 7.98%) in ZnCl2 group is increased. Moreover, the hydrocarbon content of pyrolysis oil in each group exceed 90%. The N-containing compounds can be removed by hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) reaction and convert into aromatics through ring-opening reaction. Meanwhile, the yield of the O-containing compounds in each group is less than 3%, and the lowest content is ZnCl2 group. ZnCl2-modified MTT have high specific surface area and rich mesoporous structure, which can promote deoxidation and aromatization to reach the highest aromatics content (90.23%). In addition, the content of C11–C20 in addition groups can be increased by small molecule polymerization. The catalysts promote the formation of diesel fraction through alkylation of benzene and naphthalene.
