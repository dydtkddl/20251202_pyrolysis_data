You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel form stable PCM based bio composite material for solar thermal energy storage applications Phase change materials found to be a promising solution in the field of thermal energy storage. However, the low thermal conductivity and form stability over cycles of charging and discharging of PCM are challenges to address. In the proposed study, a novel and low cost biochar-PCM hybrid latent heat energy storage material have been developed and tested. The biochar is prepared from aquatic invasive weed plants by using a batch type pyrolyser. The characteristics and properties of the novel energy storage material have been evaluated using various experimental and analytical methods. The methods include Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) and thermal conductivity tester. The study also put forward the optimized proportion of biochar and PCM in hybrid thermal energy storage material. The new material shows superior thermal conductivity over pure PCM as well as better stability due to the high carbon content and porosity of the developed biochar. Simple Impregnation method has been used to prepare form stable composite material which has good thermal and structural stability. The best mixing ratio (PCM: biochar) is found to be 6:4 (wt/wt%) with minimum leakage of PCM from the composite. The sample prepared through this method yield all the desirable properties as compared to other developed samples. The chemical properties of the composite remain the same as the pure PCM, which confirms no chemical interaction between the PCM and biochar. The heat of fusion is calculated to be 179.4 J/g. The thermal conductivity of the PCM is enhanced up to 13.82 times with the addition of water hyacinth biochar as a supporting matrix. The addition of aluminum metal powder further increases the thermal conductivity by 17.27 times higher than that of PCM alone.
