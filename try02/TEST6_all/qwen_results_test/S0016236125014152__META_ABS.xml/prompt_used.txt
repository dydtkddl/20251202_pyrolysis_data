You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Promotion of Ga in Ni/ZrO2 catalyst for ultra-stable and coke-resisting dry reforming of methane Traditional Ni-based catalysts for Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) suffer from poor stability due to carbon deposition. In this study, we developed a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by using a sol–gel method, which presents strong resistance to carbon depositions. Additionally, the metal Ga was introduced to Ni/ZrO2, which effectively enhanced the catalytic activity for DRM reaction as compared to the Ni/ZrO2. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques, including TPSR, XRD, TPR, XPS, TPD, TG, Raman, and EPR. Characterization results revealed that the addition of Ga enhanced the metal-support interaction, promoting the activation of reactant molecules by reducing the activation energy of the DRM reaction. Further investigation showed that because of the introduction of metal Ga, a large number of oxygen vacancies were fabricated, significantly increasing the CH4 conversion. Stability test indicated that the representative NiGa/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited a long-term life span in the DRM reaction for 250 h, without catalyst deactivation due to the slight carbon deposition with 1.93 wt%.
