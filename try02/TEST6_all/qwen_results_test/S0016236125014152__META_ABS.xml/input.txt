Promotion of Ga in Ni/ZrO2 catalyst for ultra-stable and coke-resisting dry reforming of methane Traditional Ni-based catalysts for Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) suffer from poor stability due to carbon deposition. In this study, we developed a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by using a sol–gel method, which presents strong resistance to carbon depositions. Additionally, the metal Ga was introduced to Ni/ZrO2, which effectively enhanced the catalytic activity for DRM reaction as compared to the Ni/ZrO2. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques, including TPSR, XRD, TPR, XPS, TPD, TG, Raman, and EPR. Characterization results revealed that the addition of Ga enhanced the metal-support interaction, promoting the activation of reactant molecules by reducing the activation energy of the DRM reaction. Further investigation showed that because of the introduction of metal Ga, a large number of oxygen vacancies were fabricated, significantly increasing the CH4 conversion. Stability test indicated that the representative NiGa/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited a long-term life span in the DRM reaction for 250 h, without catalyst deactivation due to the slight carbon deposition with 1.93 wt%.
