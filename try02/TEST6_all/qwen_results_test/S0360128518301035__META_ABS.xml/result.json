  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The abstract discusses thermal decomposition of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in polymers but does not involve pyrolysis of waste plastics or commercial plastic feedstocks, and the focus is on emission mechanisms and theoretical/quantum chemical analysis rather than lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic materials."
