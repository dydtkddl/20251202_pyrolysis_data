Co-pyrolysis of printed circuit boards (PCBs): A review on current research and future prospects The printed circuit board (PCB) is one of the most important components of modern electronics. It contains hazardous materials such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, which can be released into the environment if not properly disposed of. Furthermore, it is evolving into a pollution source owing to the presence of brominated flame retardants, which release highly toxic substances when incinerated in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, it is important to properly dispose of printed circuit boards to prevent any potential health or environmental hazards. In this regard, PCB pyrolysis has been shown in numerous studies to be a successful waste valorization method. Nevertheless, there are several drawbacks and challenges linked to inadequate decomposition, high energy demands, the utilization of expensive catalysts, and the necessity for dehalogenation. As an alternative, co-pyrolysis presents a more efficient and less detrimental method, resulting in increased oil production with less brominated flame retardants. Fuel oil is generally characterized by its calorific value which is 23 to 30.5 MJ/kg when only PCB was used for pyrolysis and can be increased to 37.7 MJ/kg PCB while co-pyrolysis with biomass. This review paper focuses current advancements in co-pyrolysis of PCBs with comprehensive overview of reaction mechanisms, debromination as well as their potential applications. Finally, the paper concludes with summary of the findings and future directions for research.
