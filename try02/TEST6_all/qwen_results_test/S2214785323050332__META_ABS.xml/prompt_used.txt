You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of printed circuit boards (PCBs): A review on current research and future prospects The printed circuit board (PCB) is one of the most important components of modern electronics. It contains hazardous materials such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, which can be released into the environment if not properly disposed of. Furthermore, it is evolving into a pollution source owing to the presence of brominated flame retardants, which release highly toxic substances when incinerated in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, it is important to properly dispose of printed circuit boards to prevent any potential health or environmental hazards. In this regard, PCB pyrolysis has been shown in numerous studies to be a successful waste valorization method. Nevertheless, there are several drawbacks and challenges linked to inadequate decomposition, high energy demands, the utilization of expensive catalysts, and the necessity for dehalogenation. As an alternative, co-pyrolysis presents a more efficient and less detrimental method, resulting in increased oil production with less brominated flame retardants. Fuel oil is generally characterized by its calorific value which is 23 to 30.5 MJ/kg when only PCB was used for pyrolysis and can be increased to 37.7 MJ/kg PCB while co-pyrolysis with biomass. This review paper focuses current advancements in co-pyrolysis of PCBs with comprehensive overview of reaction mechanisms, debromination as well as their potential applications. Finally, the paper concludes with summary of the findings and future directions for research.
