You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastics as a reburning fuel: Pyrolysis at reburning temperatures and NO-reburning by simulated pyrolysis gas Using waste plastics as a reburning fuel is promising for both reducing NOx emissions and managing plastic waste. To gain a better understanding of the chemistry involved in plastic reburning, pyrolysis products of different types of plastics at typical reburning temperatures (900–1200 °C) were investigated experimentally, and the reburning performance of simulated plastic pyrolysis gases was studied through experiments and chemical kinetic modeling. The plastics involved in the pyrolysis experiments included high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide 6 (PA6), and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS). HDPE exhibited the highest hydrocarbon gas yield (up to ∼ 70 wt% at 900 °C) while ABS had the lowest gas yield (<20 wt%) among the four plastics at the investigated temperatures. The hydrocarbon gas was composed mainly of methane, ethylene, and acetylene, with ethylene decreasing and acetylene increasing with temperatures rising from 900 to 1200 °C. Hydrogen cyanide was found to be the dominant gaseous nitrogen-containing compound for PA6 and ABS. Solid byproducts such as soot were generated at pyrolysis temperatures exceeding 1100 °C, leading to a reduction of the gas yield for all plastics. This indicates a potentially important contribution of heterogeneous NO reduction mechanisms during plastic reburning at high temperatures. Concerning the homogeneous NO reduction, reburning experiments using simulated plastic pyrolysis gases composed of methane, ethylene, and/or acetylene were carried out at 700–1200 °C in a flow reactor with an initial NO concentration of 1000 ppm and an excess air ratio λ of 0.7. Results for the simulated plastic pyrolysis gases showed NO reduction efficiencies ranging from 30 % to 46 % within the temperature range 950–1200 °C. The presence of acetylene in the simulated pyrolysis gas mixtures appears to facilitate NO reduction. A detailed chemical kinetic model applied to simulate the experiments gave a reasonable prediction of the NO reduction and revealed the important role of the ketenyl radical in removing NO.
