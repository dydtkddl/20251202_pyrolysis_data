Oil palm waste-derived reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for dynamic adsorption of dye in a fixed-bed system This study focuses on investigating the dynamic adsorption of Rhodamine B (RhB) from reduced graphene oxide (rGO) derived from oil palm waste. The synthesis of rGO from palm kernel shell (PKS) was achieved through double oxidation and carbonization method, resulting in a yield of 73.5 wt%. The reduction of oxygen-containing functionalities process using PKS was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, microscopic evaluation, and X-ray diffraction analyses. Laboratory-scale fixed-bed experiments were conducted with various process parameters. Both PKS and rGO were used as adsorbents, and a comparison was made based on breakthrough curve analysis, adsorption capacity and percentage removal of dye. The adsorption kinetics of RhB on PKS and rGO were best described by the non-linear Yoon-Nelson model, with a high adsorption capacity of 88.32 mg/g and 195.24 mg/g respectively. Using both PKS and rGO, the maximum adsorption capacity was observed when using 10 cm bed depth column, inlet dye concentration of 5 mg/L, flow rate of 12 mL/min and pH of 7. PKS exhibited good dye removal with an efficiency of 66.54%. Meanwhile, the exothermic behavior highlighted the potential of utilizing rGO for maximum dye removal, achieving an efficiency of 90.35%. This study justifies rGO as a cost-effective superior dye removal adsorbent, providing new prospect for large-scale dye removal.
