You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oil palm waste-derived reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for dynamic adsorption of dye in a fixed-bed system This study focuses on investigating the dynamic adsorption of Rhodamine B (RhB) from reduced graphene oxide (rGO) derived from oil palm waste. The synthesis of rGO from palm kernel shell (PKS) was achieved through double oxidation and carbonization method, resulting in a yield of 73.5 wt%. The reduction of oxygen-containing functionalities process using PKS was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, microscopic evaluation, and X-ray diffraction analyses. Laboratory-scale fixed-bed experiments were conducted with various process parameters. Both PKS and rGO were used as adsorbents, and a comparison was made based on breakthrough curve analysis, adsorption capacity and percentage removal of dye. The adsorption kinetics of RhB on PKS and rGO were best described by the non-linear Yoon-Nelson model, with a high adsorption capacity of 88.32 mg/g and 195.24 mg/g respectively. Using both PKS and rGO, the maximum adsorption capacity was observed when using 10 cm bed depth column, inlet dye concentration of 5 mg/L, flow rate of 12 mL/min and pH of 7. PKS exhibited good dye removal with an efficiency of 66.54%. Meanwhile, the exothermic behavior highlighted the potential of utilizing rGO for maximum dye removal, achieving an efficiency of 90.35%. This study justifies rGO as a cost-effective superior dye removal adsorbent, providing new prospect for large-scale dye removal.
