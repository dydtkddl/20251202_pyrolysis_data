The reuse of bauxite residue as a cathode for heterogeneous electro-Fenton Bauxite residue is an alkaline waste generated from aluminum smelting and generally treated by land-fill, severely challenging the surrounding environmental safety. Here, this work demonstrated that bauxite residue could be reused as a superior cathode for heterogeneous electro-Fenton (EF) process to degrade organic pollutants. With bauxite residue and straw as raw materials, a Fe-C-N contained catalyst was successfully prepared via a pyrolysis route in the presence of urea. This Fe-C-N contained catalyst exhibited promising electrocatalytic performance to reduce O2 to produce H2O2 and activate H2O2 to generate .OH simultaneously. As a heterogeneous EF cathode, 97% of rhodamine B (10 mg L−1) could be degraded within 45 min at pH 3 with a catalyst dosage of 0.2 mg mL−1, which was comparable to those reported advanced EF cathodes. The appropriate reduction of Fe-contained minerals and carbonization of straw with N doping were attributed to the superior catalytic properties. Thus, the current study provides a feasible strategy to reuse bauxite residue and upgrade them into value-added electrode material.
