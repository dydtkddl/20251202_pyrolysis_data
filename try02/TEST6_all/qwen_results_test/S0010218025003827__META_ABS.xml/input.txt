1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane pyrolysis at high pressure and temperature: Insights from theory, experiment and simulation The pyrolysis of 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (T135CH), which is a proposed surrogate for RP-3, has been investigated at a temperature range of 1017 - 1542 K and a pressure range of 13.4 – 23.5 bar. Mole fraction profiles of 30 pyrolysis products were obtained using GC-FID. Methane was found to be the most abundant product at high temperatures, followed by acetylene, while benzene was the most abundant aromatic product. A detailed kinetic model comprising 302 species and 967 reactions was developed, which showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data. This was aided by detailed ab initio calculations of elementary reactions at the CBS-QB3, CASSCF/MRCI levels of theory and conventional transition state theory (TST/VTST) calculations of rate parameters. The rate of production (ROP) analysis revealed that both unimolecular decomposition of T135CH (via CH3 elimination) and H-abstraction reactions of T135CH are responsible for its consumption. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CH3 elimination channel is the most sensitive reaction for T135CH consumption. Additionally, sensitivity analysis of aromatic product formation revealed that allene (aC3H4) and dimethylcyclohexanyl radical (S1X35DCH) play a critical role in the formation of aromatic products. The overall rate constant for T135CH decomposition was found to be: k / s − 1 = 10 6.32 ± 0.23 e x p ( − 25.1 ± 1.3 / k c a l . m o l − 1 ) R T These findings will advance our comprehension of the unimolecular decomposition of T135CH, as well as the reaction pathways involved in the formation of its aromatic products. Ultimately, this knowledge will help us better understand the combustion process of transportation fuels.
