You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanomaterials: Applications, waste-handling, environmental toxicities, and future challenges – A review Currently, nanotechnology is referred to be one of the attractive research sectors in several countries because of its vast potential and commercial impact. Nanotechnology includes the investigation, development, fabrication, and processing of structures and materials on a nanoscale in various fields of science, health care, agriculture, technology, and industries. As such, it has provided a steady restructuring of related technologies. However, the irregularities and uncertainties in dimensions and chemical compositions, makes the viability of such materials questionable. Concerns have been inclined about the transport, destiny, and transformation of nanomaterials discharged into the environment. A critical analysis of the present phase of knowledge concerning the exposure and effects of nanomaterials has been discussed in-depth. In this review, different nanomaterials along with their applications have also been reviewed, that include graphene-based nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes, and their composites, nanoclay composites, nanostructured thin films, metal-organic frameworks, conducting polymers and their composites, MXenes, chalcogenide nanocrystals, and quantum dots. Besides, a few of the groundbreaking applications of nanomaterials for different sectors like human health, processes, photochemical process, energy conversion and energy storage, separation and purification processes, optoelectronics, etc. are discussed in detail with their chemsitry. Moreover, the unique characteristics and applications of nanomaterials, they inherently introduce challenges for their applications and large-scale production. Acknowledgment of the potential benefits and unknown dangers of nanomaterials is critically is critically analyzed and discussed in the manuscript.
