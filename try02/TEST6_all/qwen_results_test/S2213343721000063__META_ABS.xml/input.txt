Nanomaterials: Applications, waste-handling, environmental toxicities, and future challenges – A review Currently, nanotechnology is referred to be one of the attractive research sectors in several countries because of its vast potential and commercial impact. Nanotechnology includes the investigation, development, fabrication, and processing of structures and materials on a nanoscale in various fields of science, health care, agriculture, technology, and industries. As such, it has provided a steady restructuring of related technologies. However, the irregularities and uncertainties in dimensions and chemical compositions, makes the viability of such materials questionable. Concerns have been inclined about the transport, destiny, and transformation of nanomaterials discharged into the environment. A critical analysis of the present phase of knowledge concerning the exposure and effects of nanomaterials has been discussed in-depth. In this review, different nanomaterials along with their applications have also been reviewed, that include graphene-based nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes, and their composites, nanoclay composites, nanostructured thin films, metal-organic frameworks, conducting polymers and their composites, MXenes, chalcogenide nanocrystals, and quantum dots. Besides, a few of the groundbreaking applications of nanomaterials for different sectors like human health, processes, photochemical process, energy conversion and energy storage, separation and purification processes, optoelectronics, etc. are discussed in detail with their chemsitry. Moreover, the unique characteristics and applications of nanomaterials, they inherently introduce challenges for their applications and large-scale production. Acknowledgment of the potential benefits and unknown dangers of nanomaterials is critically is critically analyzed and discussed in the manuscript.
