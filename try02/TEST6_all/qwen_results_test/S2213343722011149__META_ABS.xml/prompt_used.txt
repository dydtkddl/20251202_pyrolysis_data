You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of multi-element doped porous carbon by microwave cross-linking stabilization of disposable surgical masks and its electrochemical properties as sulfur loading Numerous disposable surgical masks (DSMs) were consumed with the development of COVID-19 epidemic. Non-solid products recovered by pyrolysis is more than twenty species with low added value. Therefore, the search for a reasonable carbonization method can not only alleviate the pressure of global plastic pollution, but also produce considerable economic value. Here it is found that microwave cross-linking can promote the substitution of hydrogen atom in the polymer master chain of DSMs by hydrogen atom, which can reorganize the easily cracked DSMs into sp2-hybridized aromatic carbon, it can maintain 51.2 % carbon yield at1000 ℃. The difference between the DSMs-based porous carbon obtained by in-situ and post-processing N doping was further compared, and it was found that the specific surface area of the activated in-situ doped sample (P-SNO@DSMs) was as high as 2278 m2·g−1, which had rich hierarchical pore structure and high heteroatoms doping rate. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of heteroatoms and hierarchical holes, P-SNO@DSMs sulfur cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 1550 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C and exhibits excellent long-term cycling performance with the smaller capacity decay of 0.13 % per cycle after 400 cycles. In this work, clean and efficient microwave cross-linking not only realized the efficient recovery of waste DSMs, but also the application of the prepared materials can be broadened by adding additional heteroatomic sources in the process of microwave cross-linking.
