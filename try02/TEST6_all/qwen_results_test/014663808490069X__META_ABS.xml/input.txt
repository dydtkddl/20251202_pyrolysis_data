Artificial coalification study: Preparation and characterization of synthetic mecerals It was found that lignin heated with clay minerals at 150°C for 2–8 months in the absence of oxygen was readily transformed into an insoluble material resembling low rank coals. The H/C and O/C ratios were in the natural evolutionary range found for vitrinites with the samples from longer reaction times resembling the vitrinites of higher rank. The chemical and physical characterization of the artificial products indicated that their basic chemical structure closely resembles that of vitrinite macerals. Simple pyrolysis of only the lignin at 350–400°C yielded very different products with a substantialy lower H/C ratio and a higher O/C ratio than either transformed lignin with clay or vitrinites of any rank. Such products were found to correspond to fusinite in chemical structure. Macromolecules similar to alginites or type I kerogens were produced by heating fatty acids at 200°C with clays. The present study suggests that coal macerals could have been produced directly from the biological source material via catalytic thermal reactions.
