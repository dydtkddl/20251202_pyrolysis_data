You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast degradation of vinyl chloride by green rust and nitrogen-doped graphene Carbonaceous materials catalyze reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethylenes (CEs) by iron(II) materials providing a new approach for the remediation of CE polluted groundwater. While most CEs are reduced via β-elimination, vinyl chloride (VC), the most toxic and recalcitrant CE, degrades by hydrogenolysis. The significance of carbon catalysts for reduction of VC is well documented for iron(0) systems, but hardly investigated with iron(II) materials as reductants. In this study, a layered iron(II)‑iron(III) hydroxide sulfate (green rust) was used as reductant for VC, with an N-doped graphene (NG), prepared by co-pyrolysis of graphene and urea, as catalyst. VC (80 μM) was completely reduced to ethylene within 336 h in the presence of 5 g Fe/L GR and 5 g/L NG pyrolyzed at 950 °C, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.017 h−1. Dosing experiments demonstrated that dechlorination of VC takes place on the NG phase. Monitoring of hydrogen formation, cyclic voltammetry, and quenching experiments demonstrated that atomic hydrogen contributes significantly to the dehalogenation reaction, where NG is critical for formation of atomic hydrogen. CE competition experiments demonstrated the presence of specific VC reduction sites with hydrogenolysis being unaffected by concurrent β-elimination reactions. The system exhibited excellent performance in natural groundwaters and in comparison with iron(0) systems. This study demonstrates that GR + NG is a promising system for remediation of VC contaminated groundwater, and the mechanistic part of the study can be used as a reference for subsequent studies.
