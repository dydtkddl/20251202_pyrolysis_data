Fast degradation of vinyl chloride by green rust and nitrogen-doped graphene Carbonaceous materials catalyze reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethylenes (CEs) by iron(II) materials providing a new approach for the remediation of CE polluted groundwater. While most CEs are reduced via β-elimination, vinyl chloride (VC), the most toxic and recalcitrant CE, degrades by hydrogenolysis. The significance of carbon catalysts for reduction of VC is well documented for iron(0) systems, but hardly investigated with iron(II) materials as reductants. In this study, a layered iron(II)‑iron(III) hydroxide sulfate (green rust) was used as reductant for VC, with an N-doped graphene (NG), prepared by co-pyrolysis of graphene and urea, as catalyst. VC (80 μM) was completely reduced to ethylene within 336 h in the presence of 5 g Fe/L GR and 5 g/L NG pyrolyzed at 950 °C, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.017 h−1. Dosing experiments demonstrated that dechlorination of VC takes place on the NG phase. Monitoring of hydrogen formation, cyclic voltammetry, and quenching experiments demonstrated that atomic hydrogen contributes significantly to the dehalogenation reaction, where NG is critical for formation of atomic hydrogen. CE competition experiments demonstrated the presence of specific VC reduction sites with hydrogenolysis being unaffected by concurrent β-elimination reactions. The system exhibited excellent performance in natural groundwaters and in comparison with iron(0) systems. This study demonstrates that GR + NG is a promising system for remediation of VC contaminated groundwater, and the mechanistic part of the study can be used as a reference for subsequent studies.
