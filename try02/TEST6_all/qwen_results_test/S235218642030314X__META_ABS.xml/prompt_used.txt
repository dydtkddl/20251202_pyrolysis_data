You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nutrient retention and release from raw exhausted grape marc biochars and an amended agricultural soil: Static and dynamic investigation Biochar is the solid by-product of biomass thermochemical conversion via pyrolysis technique. Biochar addition to croplands as an organic amendment can improve soil properties and increase agricultural productivity. However, these positive effects depend largely on biomass feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. In this study, nutrient release from biochars derived from the slow pyrolysis of exhausted grape marc (EGM) at 300, 400 and 500 °C (EGM300, EGM400 and EGM500) was investigated through five successive leaching assays in batch mode for a total duration of 10 days. Then, nutrient leaching/retention kinetics of an agricultural soil amended with EGM500 (1% and 5% w/w) was assessed under dynamic conditions in columns. The batch experiments showed that with the exception of P, the nutrient release efficiency from the three biochars significantly increased with the increase of the number of leaching trials. The highest released amounts were observed at the fifth leaching cycle for K, Ca, P and Mg, which were about 45.5%, 41.5%, 229.5% and 48.9% higher than those registered during the first leaching assay. Regarding the column release experiments, a biochar content of 5% in the agricultural soil resulted in an increase of water leached NO 3 − and K + by about 181.4% and 521.3%, respectively, and a significant reduction in Na + and Ca2＋ transport as compared to unamended soil. In a second phase, outcomes of column feeding with a nutrient solution showed that PO 4 3 − and NO 3 − retention by biochar-amended soils is low. Thus, the use of EGM biochar as a slow release biofertilizer could be considered as a promising agricultural practice and a sustainable solution for biowaste management.
