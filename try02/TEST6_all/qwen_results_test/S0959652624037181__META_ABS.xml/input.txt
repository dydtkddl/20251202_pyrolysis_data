Advances in flexible material catalysts for environmental applications Flexible catalysts have gained significant attention in environmental functional materials due to their high surface area, tunable structure, and mechanical flexibility. However, current research lacks a comprehensive evaluation of their flexible characteristics from both macro- and microscopic perspectives compared to rigid materials. This review summarizes the synthesis methods of two types of flexible catalysts: flexible carrier catalysts and those with special morphologies, offering guidance for selecting materials tailored to specific applications. These catalysts are applicable in redox, adsorption, and cracking catalysis for the removal of pollutants such as CO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds, and heavy metals. Flexible catalysts enhance catalytic performance by acting as oxidizing/reducing agents, providing active sites for reactant adsorption, and facilitating electron transfer in redox reactions. By modulating their structure and morphology, researchers can improve the effective adsorption area and catalytic efficiency. Evaluating the chemical and mechanical properties of flexible catalysts is essential to optimize their environmental applications. Overall, flexible catalysts show great potential for advancing environmental remediation and resource conversion processes.
