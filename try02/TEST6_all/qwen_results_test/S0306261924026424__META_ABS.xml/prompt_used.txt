You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: Machine learning prediction, interpretation, and optimization Converting waste plastics into renewable energy through zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis is a promising strategy for combating plastic pollution and supplanting conventional fossil fuels, thereby facilitating emission mitigation. However, it is still challenging to comprehensively decipherer this conversion process and screen efficient catalysts for diverse plastic feedstocks to improve the yield and quality of the resultant liquid fuel. This work explored the importance and correlations of factors in zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis and aided the zeolite screening and optimization of operational conditions for improving the oil yield and quality via machine learning (ML)-based interpretation and inverse design. The results indicated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting model developed from the complied dataset after feature selection exhibited the best performance (testing R2 of 0.85 and 0.87) for predicting the yields of liquid oil and gasoline-range (C5-C12) hydrocarbons among three tree-based algorithms. The ML-based interpretation showed that the polyethylene ratio in plastic feedstock, the reaction temperature, specific surface area, and Si/Al ratio of zeolites were the top-four important features, and their impacts on the yields of liquid oil and C5-C12 hydrocarbons were discussed in detail. A maximum oil yield of 80.85 % was achieved from ML-based inverse design, and the corresponding optimal inputs from the model could guide the experimental investigation. It showed that a high oil yield of 87.82 % was obtained from experiment that was even higher than the model result with a small error of −7.93 %. This work provides a novel ML-based approach to understand the zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics and improve the yield and quality of liquid oil for sustainable energy production.
