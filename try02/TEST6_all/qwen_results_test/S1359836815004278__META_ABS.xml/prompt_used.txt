You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-functional hindered amine light stabilizers-functionalized carbon nanotubes for advanced ultra-high molecular weight Polyethylene-based nanocomposites Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer (HAS) molecules have been covalently linked on the outer surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the so-obtained multi-functional fillers (HAS-f-CNTs) have been compounded with Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) to get composite films. The success of the grafting reaction of the HAS molecules has been confirmed through spectroscopic and thermo-gravimetric analyses. Morphological analyses reveal a segregated microstructure, in which CNT-rich channels surround the polymer domains. This morphology results in improved mechanical properties and appreciable electrical conductive features. More importantly, the addition of only 1 wt.% of HAS-f-CNTs brings about a significant improvement of the photo-oxidation resistance, which neither HAS nor CNTs can provide if used separately. The origin of this synergic effect is discussed. Overall, our results demonstrate the possibility of using properly functionalized CNTs as multi-functional fillers to get high-performance polymer composites.
