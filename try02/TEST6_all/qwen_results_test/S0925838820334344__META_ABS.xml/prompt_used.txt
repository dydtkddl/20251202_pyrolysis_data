You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electronic structure tuning of FeCo nanoparticles embedded in multi-dimensional carbon matrix for enhanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis It is highly desirable to develop efficient, affordable and durable electrocatalysts to accelerate sluggish kinetics of both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for expanding the applications of Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Here, Fe1Co2 alloy nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes/carbon nanosheets (CNTs/CNSs) (denoted as Fe1Co2-NC) were synthesized in situ by pyrolyzing Fe-chitosan, Co-chitosan chelates and urea. It is demonstrated that the interaction of Fe and Co can effectively modulate electronic structure of Fe and Co, in which ionic state cobalt and iron were partially oxidized, contributing to the enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. Meanwhile, CNTs/CNSs multi-dimensional porous carbon frameworks facilitated adequate exposure of active sites and mass/electron smooth transport. Accordingly, the resulting Fe1Co2-NC catalyst exhibited a high half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) for ORR and a small over potential (0.356 V) for OER, rendering it with an ultralow potential difference (0.706 V) that can rival that of Pt/C + RuO2 (0.69 V). Impressively, the assembled ZABs with Fe1Co2-NC as a cathode catalyst achieved a high open circuit voltage (1.501 V), maximum power density (203.4 mW cm−2), energy density (820.30 W h kg−1) and robust durability with a slightly increased voltage gap (0.058 V) after 209 h charge-discharge test, shedding light on the great application potential.
