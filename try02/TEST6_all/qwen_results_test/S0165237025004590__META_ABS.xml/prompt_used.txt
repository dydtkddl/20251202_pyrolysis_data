You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress on photothermal catalytic conversion of waste plastics Photothermal catalysis, as an efficient recycling technology for waste plastics, can convert waste plastics into high value-added chemicals, which is an important way to achieve sustainable recycling of plastics. Both traditional catalytic pyrolysis and photocatalytic technologies have inherent defects, while photothermal catalysis technology effectively makes up for the shortcomings of a single technology by synergistic light-heat integration, thus elevating plastic conversion efficiency and selectivity. In this paper, we systematically introduce the latest progress in the photothermal catalytic conversion of waste plastics on various catalysts (semiconductors, metal nanoions, carbon materials and composite catalysts) to prepare chemicals, focusing on the effects of different catalysts and reaction devices on the photothermal catalytic process and product distribution. In addition, the reaction mechanisms involved in photothermal catalysis such as non-radiative relaxation in semiconductors, thermal vibration of molecules, and local heating of plasma are systematically discussed. Based on the current research progress, this paper further points out the key scientific problems and technical challenges faced by this technology in the application of plastic recycling, and provides an important reference for the development of efficient recycling technology of waste plastics.
