Sustainable synthesis of metal-organic frameworks and their derived materials from organic and inorganic wastes Due to the increasingdemandfor the scale-up of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and the implementation of their potential in more industrial applications, many challenges need to be overcome related to the cost and availability of some precursors and the MOF synthesis conditions. In order to achieve a level allowing the industrialization of the production of MOFs, it is highly important to develop alternative methods for more sustainable and green synthesis of MOFs and their derived materials. In the context of organic and inorganic precursors shortage, the use of waste derived resources as a reliable source for both organic and inorganic elements is now being targeted for the production of these high-value materials, while considering the associated cost, as well as the environmental impacts of the precursors and the synthesis procedures. Combining two or more waste materials as precursors can be highly beneficial value and cost-wise for materials. This review is focused on the use of sustainable approaches and low-cost strategies for the synthesis of MOFs based mainly on the extraction of organic and inorganic precursors from recyclable waste, more specifically i) PET waste bottles as a valuable source for organic ligands and ii) electronic inorganic solid materials and other solid wastes containing metallic precursors recovered from industrial wastewater and electroplating sludge (EPS), petroleum refinery waste, etc. as a source for metallic ions, in addition to the inorganic insoluble precursors as non-conventional resources to yield pristine MOF, MOF composites and their derived materials such as carbons and oxide composites for advanced applications. Some advantages of these MOFs resourced from wastes will be given and compared to their homologue prepared from commercial precursors. This review will give an overview of how alternative routes from organic and inorganic wastes are important for the new trend of MOFs.
