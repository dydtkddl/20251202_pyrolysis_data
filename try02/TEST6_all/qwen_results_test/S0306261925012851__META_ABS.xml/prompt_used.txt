You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State-of-the-Art review of liquid organic hydrogen carriers for hydrogen storage and transport: challenges and perspectives Despite the difficulty of creating safe and effective hydrogen storage technologies, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) technology offers promise for stable and effective hydrogen storage and transportation, allowing for long-cycle hydrogen storage and safe and affordable large-scale transoceanic transportation. This research is a bibliometric and systematic review regarding research trends from the year 2000 to 2024 on LOHCs. The analysis reveals a significant increase in the output of global scientific literature on the topic, with a growth rate of 38.67 and an average citation rate of 29.69, indicating that the LOHCs have had increasing attention in terms of their possible solutions for hydrogen storage and transportation. The focus areas included hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes, important studies on the development of efficient carrier molecules (dibenzyl-toluene, N-ethylcarbazole), optimization of catalyst systems (mostly platinum and ruthenium), and confirmation of thermodynamic characterization, thermal integration, and reactor efficiencies in the area. The thematic mapping is indicative of crossovers between molecular innovation and wider system energy strategies. Life cycle analysis and techno-economic assessments showed that LOHC systems today cannot be sustained and are expensive. Future research should therefore focus on quantum chemical simulations, life cycle assessments, and their coupling to green hydrogen integration and hybrid reactor designs. The proposed activities toward CO2-neutral and bio-feedstock-compatible multifunctional LOHCs, as well as more low-cost and thermally stable options, are needed to adapt LOHC technologies for a scalable sustainable hydrogen economy.
