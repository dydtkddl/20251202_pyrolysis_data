You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Monodispersed Co-N3 loaded carbon nitride mediated peroxymonosulfate activation for rapid degradation of trace urea via singlet oxygen The removal of trace urea presents a significant challenge in the production of electronic-grade ultra-pure water (UPW). This study proposed a simple strategy to regulate the low-coordination of a single-atom cobalt catalyst (RyCo-CN0.20) for the efficient removal of trace urea via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The optimal R0.50Co-CN0.20 with low-coordination Co-N3 sites was constructed by in-situ reduction of NaBH4 and significantly enhanced the PMS activation. The removal efficiency of trace urea achieved 94 % within 5 mins. The kobs of trace urea degradation in R0.50Co-CN0.20/PMS system reached 0.4576 min−1, which was much higher than previous reported systems. Experiments of free radical quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrated that singlet oxygen species were the dominant free radical. The corresponding steady concentration of singlet oxygen species in the R0.50Co-CN0.20/PMS system was enhanced to be 16.361 × 10–6 μM, which was twice of Co-CN0.20/PMS. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optimized electron distribution of the Co center in the Co-N3 sites processed a higher d band center (−1.08 eV) and richer electron transfer number (0.75 e−) compared with Co-N4 sites, hence realizing the stronger PMS activation. Continuous operation verified that R0.50Co-CN0.20/PMS could maintain the removal rate of trace urea above 80 % after 150 h operation. Moreover, R0.50Co-CN0.20/PMS in the pilot UPW production process effectively reduced the pollution caused by trace urea and ensured the quality of the terminal UPW (Total organic carbon <1 μg/L). This study provides a new approach for the removal of trace urea through PMS activation by low-coordination single-atom catalysts.
