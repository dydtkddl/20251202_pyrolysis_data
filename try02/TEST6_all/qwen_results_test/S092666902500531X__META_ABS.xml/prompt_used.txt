You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of Alhagi sparsifolia Shap biomass over HZSM-5: Thermal behavior, kinetics, thermodynamics and evolved products Biomass feedstocks and their complex components can yield a wide range of pyrolysis products. Furthermore, catalytic pyrolysis has emerged as a promising technology for the conversion of biomass into high-value chemicals. This study investigated the pyrolysis behavior, kinetics, thermodynamics and evolved products of Alhagi sparsifolia Shap (A. sparsifolia), a biomass from arid area. Its catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 catalyst was carried out and compared with the non-catalytic pyrolysis. The results indicated that the mass loss decreased from 69.35 to 74.98 wt% to 48.78–58.53 wt% upon the addition of HZSM-5. Both degradation process occurred in three stages: below 200 ℃, 200–500 ℃, and 500–900 ℃. The presence of HZSM-5 lowered the peak temperatures from 352.8 to 377.7 ℃ to 328.7–331.4 ℃. In addition, the average apparent activation energy decreased from 102.79 to 78.00 kJ mol−1. The master-plots method indicated that the experimental curves for both conversions were consistent with the diffusion-based model. Positive ΔH and ΔG values confirmed that both decompositions were endothermic and non-spontaneous. However, the inclusion of HZSM-5 enhanced the reactivity of the sample while reducing the energy requirement. GC-MS analysis revealed that the products formed at peak temperatures of 365 ℃ for non-catalytic pyrolysis were mainly phenols and ketones. In contrast, the catalytic pyrolysis at 335 ℃ simplified the product composition and favored the formation of acetic acid and furfural with higher selectivity.
