You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on H3PO4-activated carbon catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and LDPE to poly-generation syngas and aromatics at low temperature Biomass-derived carbon activated by H3PO4 was adopted to catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to produce syngas and aromatics on a fixed bed reactor. Effects of LDPE ratio in the feedstock, catalytic co-pyrolysis temperature and ratio of catalyst to feedstock on the yields and compositions of the products were investigated. The increase of LDPE ratio in liquid first improved and then reduced the relative content of aromatics, while it showed a positive effect on the yield and the H2/CO ratio of gas. 500℃ was an optimum temperature, under which the relative content of aromatics in liquid kept higher, meanwhile, avoided the undesirable polymerization reactions of monocyclic aromatics. At the same time, the content of H2 in gas reached a maximum (59.3%), which was in favor of poly-generation. H3PO4-activated carbon catalyst (H3PO4-ACC) with abundant functional groups on surface catalyzed cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, cyclization and aromatization reactions so as to facilitate the generation of aromatics. Non-condensable gas was dry reformed on P-ACC at the expense of CO2, CH4 and CO to generate char and H2. When the reaction condition was at a LDPE ratio of 50%, a catalyst/feedstock ratio of 2:1 and at 500℃, the relative content of aromatics in liqiud was 81.65% and the proportion of syngas component in gas was 79.73%. The volume ratio of H2/CO approached to 3:1 in gas under this condition. H3PO4-ACC catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and LDPE could obtain high quality gas and liquid products at a relative low reaction temperature, which provided a new research idea on high-value application of biomass and waste plastics.
