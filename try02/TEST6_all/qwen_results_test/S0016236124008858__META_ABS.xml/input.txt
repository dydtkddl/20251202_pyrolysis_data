Study on H3PO4-activated carbon catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and LDPE to poly-generation syngas and aromatics at low temperature Biomass-derived carbon activated by H3PO4 was adopted to catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to produce syngas and aromatics on a fixed bed reactor. Effects of LDPE ratio in the feedstock, catalytic co-pyrolysis temperature and ratio of catalyst to feedstock on the yields and compositions of the products were investigated. The increase of LDPE ratio in liquid first improved and then reduced the relative content of aromatics, while it showed a positive effect on the yield and the H2/CO ratio of gas. 500℃ was an optimum temperature, under which the relative content of aromatics in liquid kept higher, meanwhile, avoided the undesirable polymerization reactions of monocyclic aromatics. At the same time, the content of H2 in gas reached a maximum (59.3%), which was in favor of poly-generation. H3PO4-activated carbon catalyst (H3PO4-ACC) with abundant functional groups on surface catalyzed cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, cyclization and aromatization reactions so as to facilitate the generation of aromatics. Non-condensable gas was dry reformed on P-ACC at the expense of CO2, CH4 and CO to generate char and H2. When the reaction condition was at a LDPE ratio of 50%, a catalyst/feedstock ratio of 2:1 and at 500℃, the relative content of aromatics in liqiud was 81.65% and the proportion of syngas component in gas was 79.73%. The volume ratio of H2/CO approached to 3:1 in gas under this condition. H3PO4-ACC catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and LDPE could obtain high quality gas and liquid products at a relative low reaction temperature, which provided a new research idea on high-value application of biomass and waste plastics.
