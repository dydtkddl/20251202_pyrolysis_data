You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation of waste polyolefin composition on thermal conversion into petroleum-derived products Thermal pyrolysis of polyolefins has been proposed as one of the possible ways to obtain petroleum-derived products (fuels and chemicals) from waste plastics however, there is a lack of deep understanding of the correlation between the structure and composition of polyolefin feedstock with pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil has been obtained from polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) in a tubular reactor at 500 °C. TGA-DTG, 13C CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, and XRD were used to analyze the polyolefin (PE and PP) feedstock, while pyrolysis oil was characterized by GC–MS, FTIR, and 1H NMR techniques. The pyrolysis oil from virgin and waste PP yielded branched alphaolefins and cycloparaffins, while virgin and waste PE produce linear alpha olefins and linear paraffins. Mixed waste plastic (MWP) produces major amount of linear paraffins and linear alpha olefins, indicating the overall trend of branching in polyolefins (PE and PP) from feedstock to product oil is retained after pyrolysis. The alpha olefins can be used as chemical intermediates, while 2,4 dimethyl 1-heptene from PP can be used as a fine chemical precursor better feedstock for gasoline. Segregation of waste plastics is challenging task in real life but source segregation and selective collection of waste plastics from various sources can produce useful products like high octane gasoline range hydrocarbons and high-value chemicals.
