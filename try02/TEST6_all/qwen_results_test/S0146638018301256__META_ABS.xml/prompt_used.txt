You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cyclopentanones and 2-cyclopenten-1-ones as major products of hydrous pyrolysis of immature organic-rich shales Cyclopentanone is an important platform chemical for various industrial syntheses. It has been recently reported as a major product in biomass cellulose-derived biofuels but has rarely been reported in geochemical research. We report here the abundant occurrence of cyclopentanone, 2-cyclopenten-1-one and their alkyl derivatives in pyrolysates of organic-rich shales. Closed system pyrolyses at temperatures from 290 °C to 350 °C have been carried out on thermally immature organic-rich shale samples of Ordovician and Devonian age from Canada. GC–MS analyses of the pyrolysates show that cyclopentanones, 2-cyclopenten-1-ones and phenols dominate over hydrocarbons in the low temperature hydrous pyrolysates, and their abundance relative to hydrocarbons decreases with increasing thermal maturation. However, these low molecular weight cyclic ketones are only minor components compared with hydrocarbons in anhydrous pyrolysates, indicating that water has played an important role in the formation of these oxygen-containing compounds. In addition, n-alkan-2-ones in the range of C6–C35 are also detected in the hydrous pyrolysates, but they are at much reduced concentrations compared with the cyclic ketones. The potential precursors in the shale and the likely chemical reaction mechanism for the formation of these cyclic ketones are discussed in detail in the paper.
