You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of gasification fundamentals and new findings: Reactors, feedstock, and kinetic studies The purpose of this work is to comprehensively review recent findings on gasification kinetics related to the reaction mechanism, the effects of the experimental procedure on the overall reaction, and methods to evaluate kinetic models. Understanding the recent findings in gasification requires the presentation of selected publications that cover several potentially ambiguous concepts. Firstly, conventional reactor definitions are not sufficient given that three reactions (combustion, pyrolysis and gasification) occur in an industrial gasifier. Secondly, variables affecting char reactivity during gasification show that the char surface area is the most complex variable to analyze. Also, single-step kinetic models provide better descriptions of the reaction mechanism assuming kinetic control of the overall reaction. The new findings are related to the gasification reaction mechanism and the interpretation of kinetic results: (a) the maximum gasification rate observed is a consequence of the gas concentration development upon changing the inert gas for the gasifying agent, and not due to changes in the char surface during gasification, as proposed by Bhatia and Perlmutter in 1980; (b) increasing the time of holding the char at the reaction temperature in an inert gas decreases the gasification rate; (c) char micropore surface area and alkali content are the two most important variables affecting the gasification rate; and, (d) laboratory studies may not represent the real gasification mechanism under kinetically controlled conditions due to the presence of mass transfer limitations from interparticle diffusion. Therefore, the acceptance of intrinsic kinetics reported in the literature should be revalidated.
