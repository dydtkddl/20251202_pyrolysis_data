You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing the potential of the recycled plastic slow pyrolysis for the production of streams attractive for refineries The slow pyrolysis of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated in a batch autoclave reactor at 430–490 °C and reaction times of 15–60 min, with the aim of obtaining the maximum yield of plastic oil (PO) with an adequate composition for its subsequent valorization in refinery. Specifically, PO yields up to 85–90 wt% have been achieved operating at 430 °C and 15–37.5 min, noting that the obtained yields strongly depend on temperature and, to a lesser extent, on reaction time. Simulated distillation and gas chromatography analyses of PO have shown its potential for its valorization in a waste refinery scheme targeting the production of alternative fuels. Thus, the PO obtained at 430 °C and 15 min is suitable to be cofed to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit since it has a simulated distillation curve similar to that of vacuum gasoil (VGO). On the other hand, the PO obtained at 430 °C at the longest reaction time and those obtained at 460 °C are suitable to be fed together with light cycle oil (LCO) into a hydroprocessing unit. The composition of naphtha and middle distillates of PO reveals that these fractions are appropriate for their blending with commercial diesel and gasoline pools after a mild hydrotreating to reduce their olefin content.
