You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CaO and isopropanol transesterify and crack triglycerides to isopropyl esters and green diesel Fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) synthesized by transesterifying vegetable oil and fats with methanol are unsuitable for northern climates and alpine regions. Isopropyl esters derived from oil and isopropanol have superior cold flow properties and lower cloud point but reaction rates are slow in batch liquid phase processes. To accelerate the reaction rates by several orders of magnitude, we atomize mixtures of canola oil and isopropanol into a fluidized bed of CaO/Al2O3 operating at 450°C. Coke, CO, CO2, isopropyl esters and hydrocarbons in the C 5 - C 19 range form at contact times less than 1s. A solenoid valve cycles the feed composition between oil/isopropanol and air, which maximizes the reaction rates and maintains a constant level of coke. The dwell time of the catalyst in oil/isopropanol and air is 2min. The coke yield ranges from 3.5% to 34% and the isopropyl esters yield varies from 2% to 31% for isopropanol:triglycerides molar ratios equal to 28, 35 and 51. The coke yield decreases with isopropanol:triglycerides molar ratios and O2 flow during the regeneration step while the isopropyl esters yield increases. The highest hydrocarbons yield was 42%.
