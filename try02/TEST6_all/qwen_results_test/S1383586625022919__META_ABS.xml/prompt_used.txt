You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pelletizing zeolite templated carbon for carbon capture: Developing an analytics-driven framework for binder selection Pelletized sorbent particles were preferred over powders in large-scale CO2 capture applications since pelletized adsorbents with high mechanical strength can improve bed stability, reduce reactor pressure drop, reduce adsorbent particle attrition, and reduce equipment clogging. This study examines the pelletization of zeolite templated carbon (ZTC) as a promising CO2 adsorbent with a comprehensive experimental and analytical approach. Four binders, namely CMC-NH4, CMC, SBR, and PTFE, were employed to pelletize ZTC, and it was found that the ZTC pelletized by the CMC-NH4 binder exhibited the highest mechanical strength and CO2 adsorption capacity. CMC-NH4 on the ZTC surface has the strongest binding energy (−48.52 kcal mol−1) and it binds the ZTC particles together via a line-type connection, providing ZTC@CMC-NH4-10 wt% pellet the highest mechanical strength of 3.0 MPa. Meanwhile, the CMC-NH4 binder enhances ZTC surface polarity and provides new adsorption sites, increasing the pellet’s CO2 adsorption capacity. This was particularly true at a low CO2 concentration of 400 ppm, where the adsorption capacity of the pellets was 6 times that of ZTC powder. A generalized computationally accelerated binder selection framework was then developed by correlating the binder selection criteria for CO2 capture with computationally attenable pellet characteristics for different binders.
