Pelletizing zeolite templated carbon for carbon capture: Developing an analytics-driven framework for binder selection Pelletized sorbent particles were preferred over powders in large-scale CO2 capture applications since pelletized adsorbents with high mechanical strength can improve bed stability, reduce reactor pressure drop, reduce adsorbent particle attrition, and reduce equipment clogging. This study examines the pelletization of zeolite templated carbon (ZTC) as a promising CO2 adsorbent with a comprehensive experimental and analytical approach. Four binders, namely CMC-NH4, CMC, SBR, and PTFE, were employed to pelletize ZTC, and it was found that the ZTC pelletized by the CMC-NH4 binder exhibited the highest mechanical strength and CO2 adsorption capacity. CMC-NH4 on the ZTC surface has the strongest binding energy (−48.52 kcal mol−1) and it binds the ZTC particles together via a line-type connection, providing ZTC@CMC-NH4-10 wt% pellet the highest mechanical strength of 3.0 MPa. Meanwhile, the CMC-NH4 binder enhances ZTC surface polarity and provides new adsorption sites, increasing the pellet’s CO2 adsorption capacity. This was particularly true at a low CO2 concentration of 400 ppm, where the adsorption capacity of the pellets was 6 times that of ZTC powder. A generalized computationally accelerated binder selection framework was then developed by correlating the binder selection criteria for CO2 capture with computationally attenable pellet characteristics for different binders.
