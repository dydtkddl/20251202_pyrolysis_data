V2O5-based photocatalysts for environmental improvement: Key challenges and advancements In recent years, the photocatalytic process has been widely employed as a simple and economical approach for the removal of various harmful pollutants and the production of valuable chemical fuels. Considerable efforts have been made to develop efficient photocatalysts as a key for environmental improvement. In this prospective, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has attracted a lot of attention as a photocatalyst due to its outstanding properties such as low cost, narrow bandgap (∼2.3 eV), optical and chemical stability, and multiple oxidation states. This article presents a comprehensive review of the current research activities, including physicochemical properties of V2O5, performance optimization strategies, photocatalytic mechanism, and the relationship between structure and activity of various V2O5-based photocatalysts, especially V2O5-based heterojunction photocatalysts. Finally, the possible future development, opportunities, and key challenges of V2O5-based photocatalysts are also summarized. We expect to be able to provide some references and suggestions for the rational design and fabrication of highly efficient V2O5-based photocatalysts for environmental improvement.
