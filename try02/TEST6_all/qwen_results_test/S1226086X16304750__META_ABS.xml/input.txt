Hydrogenation of methyl methacrylate under mild conditions using biosynthesis Ru catalyst Hydrogenation of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was investigated over Ru-based catalyst supported on active carbons (AC), which was prepared by bio-reduction method, using C. Platycladi (CP) leaf extract as reductant. By varying reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure and reaction time, hydrogenation of MMA over the biosynthesis Ru-based catalyst was carried out, and resulted the optimum conditions, 30°C (room temperature), 2.0MPa, and 50min. The as-prepared Ru/AC catalyst showed high catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of MMA, affording 100% of MMA conversion even under mild conditions without solvent and methyl isobutyrate was the only product.
