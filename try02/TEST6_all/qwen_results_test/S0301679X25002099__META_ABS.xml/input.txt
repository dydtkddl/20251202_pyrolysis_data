Development of functionally graded films and coatings for biomaterials: Methods, properties, and challenges – A comprehensive review Coating metal substrates and biomaterial implants demand a balance of diverse properties. Functionally graded coatings (FGCs) offer tailored mechanical, thermal, electrical, and tribological benefits for engineering and biomedical uses. Recent advancements in FGCs have notably reduced aseptic loosening and fibrous tissue encapsulation by 30 % and 25 %, respectively, enhancing biocompatibility and mechanical stability. These improvements are driven by changes in the coatings' composition, structure, and porosity. This paper reviews the latest FGC processing techniques for bio-implants, emphasizing recent research, applications, and future challenges. It provides guidelines to help researchers navigate this complex field and achieve successful, patient-centered outcomes.
