Anode electrocatalysts and their supporting materials for methanol oxidation reaction based on research conducted in recent five years: Comprehensive review Platinum-based catalysts are widely used for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), but their excessive cost and scarcity drive the search for alternative materials. This review summarises recent advancements in anode electrocatalysts and support materials for MOR over the past five years. It covers noble metals, transition metal oxides, and carbon-based nanomaterials, emphasising their electrocatalytic performance and structure-property relationships. The role of various supports, including carbon-based, self-assembly, and non-carbon-based carriers, in optimising catalyst performance is discussed. Additionally, strategies to enhance durability and resistance to poisoning, such as surface modification, alloying, and heteroatom doping, are examined. The review highlights the relationship between catalyst design and electrochemical performance, identifies challenges in DMFC optimisation, and underscores the importance of tailoring MOR electrocatalysts for commercial viability.
