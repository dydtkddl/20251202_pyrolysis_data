You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing bioenergy Efficiency: Microwave-Assisted Co-pyrolysis of plastic and sludge waste with catalytic upgrading The growing accumulation of plastic and sewage sludge (SS) waste necessitates effective and sustainable valorization technologies. This study presents a novel integration of microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and SS, offering a dual solution for waste reduction and bioenergy recovery. The research uniquely combines synergistic feedstock interaction, catalyst performance and comprehensive energy analysis within a microwave-driven system, an area seldom explored in previous literature. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, PET/SS feedstock ratio and catalyst type (HZSM-5 and KOH) were systematically investigated. HZSM-5 significantly enhanced bio-oil yield (up to 49.5 wt%) and bioenergy density (31.88 MJ/kg), while KOH promoted higher biochar yield (up to 70.05 wt%) with improved fuel stability. Catalyst addition also influenced product composition, increasing valuable compounds like ketones and aromatic hydrocarbons while modulating biogas profiles (CO and CO2). GC-MS and GC-TCD analyses validated the compositional changes. The study demonstrated bioenergy extraction efficiencies ranging from 36.74 % to 92.50 %, although overall process energy efficiency remained lower due to energy losses at the lab scale. Nonetheless, catalysts induce lower reliance on operating temperature, enabling lower-temperature operation and indicating potential energy savings in scaled-up systems. The use of microwave energy also offers rapid, selective heating with reduced startup times, which is advantageous for continuous industrial processes. This work highlights the added value of catalyst, microwave synergy for improving energy yields and product quality from heterogeneous waste. The insights gained provide a critical foundation for designing scalable, efficient microwave pyrolysis systems and advancing waste-to-energy technologies in support of a circular economy.
