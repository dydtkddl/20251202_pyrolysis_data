You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An overview of swelling stress formation and control of metal hydride for high-safety and high-density hydrogen storage applications The storage of hydrogen is a crucial challenge in the advancement of hydrogen energy due to hydrogen's high diffusivity and flammability. Metal‑hydrogen reaction hydrogen storage (MHHS) realizes efficient and safe hydrogen storage at high hydrogen storage density and low hydrogen storage pressure by reacting metals with hydrogen to form metal hydrides (MHs). However, the expansion effect generated by MHs during hydrogen absorption can exert swelling pressure on the MH hydrogen storage reactor (MHR) equivalent to several times the hydrogen pressure, which may lead to reactor deformation or even cracking. Therefore, identifying the root causes of swelling stress and developing effective mitigation strategies are essential for ensuring the safety and stability of the MHHS system in engineering applications. This paper provides a new insight that non-uniform volume expansion of MHs under constraints is the root cause of swelling stress concentration and identifies the key factors influencing stress through a systematic multidimensional analysis encompassing alloy materials, reaction conditions, cycling number, and reactor orientation. Then, multi-scale numerical models from both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives are established to guide stress reduction based on the proposed formation mechanisms and the corresponding key factors. Furthermore, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of methods for reducing swelling stress at the material, bed, and reactor levels. These methods include enhancing the alloy's resistance to pulverization at the material level, increasing expansion space for MHs within the bed at the bed level, and optimizing MHR's structure at the reactor level, offering valuable technical guidance for safety-oriented large-scale engineering applications of MHHS.
