You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation-assisted design of a catalytic hydrogenation reactor for plastic pyrolysis fuels An enhancement of the properties of pyrolysis liquids (PL) from municipal plastic waste (mainly low-density polyethylene) by catalytic hydrotreatment is required to obtain automotive quality fuels. In this context, we report the design of a pilot catalytic hydrotreatment reactor using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This modelling technique considered fluid flows, gas diffusion, olefin hydrogenation reactions, and heat transfer. The built model allowed the development of different sensitive analysis to evaluate the influence of spatial time, heat transfer fluid (used as a reactor coolant) and hydrogen/pyrolysis liquid ratio. Possible phase changes (from gas to liquid) were analyzed by a thermodynamic approach. The results showed that the refrigerant oil allows alleviating possible temperature gradients arising from the exothermic hydrogenation reaction. It was also found that the system can be optimized in order to minimize the energy cost by adjusting the inlet temperature of the reactive gas (H2) and the refrigerant oil flow. Condensations in the reactive chamber could be avoided by working at intermediate pressures (40–60 bar) and/or increasing the feed of H2. Additionally, the results obtained with the CFD 3D model together with the condensation analysis allowed to optimize the operational regime and the pilot-reactor design in terms of dimensioning and construction materials.
