Exploration of reaction mechanisms on the plastic waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dissolved in phenol steam reforming reaction to produce hydrogen and valuable liquid fuels The recycling of plastic waste is a good idea for countries which concern air pollution, CO2 emission, and public health. In this research article, PET, as one of the significant plastic waste, was selected to dissolve in phenol for value‐added liquid fuels and hydrogen gas production. This research aims to provide insight into the mechanism of PET waste and phenol steam reforming reaction. The catalytic steam reforming of PET dissolved in phenol employing Ni-Pt/Al-Ti catalyst was conducted in a fixed bed reactor. The reaction test illustrated that Ni-Pt/Al-Ti catalyst possesses high activity and stability in a long time on stream experiment. It was found that valuable liquid fuels such as styrene, acetic acid, benzoic, benzene, and many other components successfully produced from the PET-phenol steam reforming reaction. It was found that during the catalytic reforming of PET, several types of reactions such as dehydrogenation reaction, thermal cracking, steam reforming, water gas shift reaction, carbenium ion reaction, free radical reaction, dihydroxylation reaction, and coke formation occurred.
