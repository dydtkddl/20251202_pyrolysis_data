Low-temperature dechlorination methods for pyrolysis oil of municipal plastic waste Pyrolysis oil produced from municipal plastic waste can be utilized as fuel and various valuable chemicals as an alternative to petroleum. However, pyrolysis oil usually contains a relatively high concentration of chlorinated compounds, obstructing its utilization in the chemical industry. The present research reveals that pyrolysis oil contains inorganic chlorine and organochlorine compounds, and differentiated approaches should be considered to remove Cl from covalent and ionic chlorine linkages. Transition metal-based ZSM-5 catalysts showed remarkable dechlorination performance via mild C-Cl cracking of 1-chlorooctane and 4-chlorotoluene at 180 °C or below. The neutralization method of mixing pyrolysis oil with an alkaline solution quickly eliminated ionic chlorine from inorganic chlorine compounds, reducing Cl concentrations by up to 70 % at temperature below 40 °C. Based on the different dechlorinating pathways, an ideal combination of these two methods was suggested to enhance chlorine removal efficiency from pyrolysis oil.
