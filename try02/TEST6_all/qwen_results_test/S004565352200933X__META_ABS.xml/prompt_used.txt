You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of film waste over Co/Ni pillared montmorillonites towards H2 production The transformation of plastic waste into valuable fuel products via catalytic pyrolysis is a promising and eco-friendly strategy. Herein, a series of Co/Ni pillared montmorillonites were developed as low-cost and effective catalysts for the pyrolysis of post-consumer film waste, which is one of the representative plastic wastes in nature. The best-performing catalyst produced 80.2% of liquid product, with a high selectivity of 43.5% of hydrocarbons at C10–C13 range, and 42.0 vol% of H2 which is nearly increased by 40-fold as compared to that in non-catalytic run. The improved results were ascribed to the pillared structure, the oxidation state of Co/Ni, and the distribution of acid sites. Particularly, the Lewis acidity (which governs the cyclization and alkanisation) coupled with high surface area and uniform dispersion of transition metallic sites, were found to promote the selectivity of condensable product. The pyrolytic mechanism towards H2 production was explored by theoretical calculations. The lattice oxygen bonded to both Ni and Co in an octahedral environment was found to promote the adsorption of the fragment of polymer in dehydrogenation. Additionally, the solid residues are potentially applied for the production of valuable carbonaceous materials since they displayed high heating value. This work is expected to provide a direction for the development of pyrolysis technology for fuel production with sustainability and economic viability.
