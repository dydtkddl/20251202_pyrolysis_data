Numerical evaluation and parameter optimization of bischofite pyrolysis: A new approach to solid waste treatment In this study, we introduce an innovative treatment process for bischofite, utilizing a sophisticated decomposition model in conjunction with a multi-step chemical reaction of Magnesium chloride hydrate. The thermochemical conversion processes are rigorously evaluated through numerical simulations within a cyclone spray pyrolysis furnace. The temperature and flow rate of hot carrier gas and the amount of raw material are analyzed and optimized using response surface methodology, with fuel consumption serving as a critical indicator. The results show that the numerical model is reliable. The mass fraction of solid phase product MgO increases with the increase of hot carrier gas inlet temperature, inlet flow rate and furnace height. Through careful analysis, we have determined the optimal operating parameters for the pilot furnace to be a raw material handling capacity of 227 kg/h, a hot carrier gas inlet temperature of 1273 K, and an inlet flow rate of 2.28 m3/s, yielding a minimum fuel consumption per ton of raw material of 3.40 GJ.
