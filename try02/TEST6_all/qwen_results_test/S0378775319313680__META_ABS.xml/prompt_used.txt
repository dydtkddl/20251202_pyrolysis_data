You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on NiFe-based electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential electrochemical reaction in water-splitting and rechargeable-metal-air-batteries to achieve clean energy production and efficient energy-storage. At first, this review discusses about the mechanism for OER, where an oxygen molecule is produced with the involvement of four electrons and OER intermediates but the reaction pathway is influenced by the pH. Then, this review summarizes the brief discussion on theoretical calculations, and those suggest the suitability of NiFe based catalysts for achieving optimal adsorption for OER intermediates by tuning the electronic structure to enhance the OER activity. Later, we review the recent advancement in terms of synthetic methodologies, chemical properties, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and catalytic performances of several nanostructured NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts, and those include layered double hydroxide (LDH), cation/anion/formamide intercalated LDH, teranary LDH/LTH (LTH: Layered-triple-hydroxide), LDH with defects/vacancies, LDH integrated with carbon, hetero atom doped/core-shell structured/heterostructured LDH, oxide/(oxy)hydroxide, alloy/mineral/boride, phosphide/phosphate, chalcogenide (sulfide and selenide), nitride, graphene/graphite/carbon-nano-tube containing NiFe based electrocatalysts, NiFe based carbonaceous materials, and NiFe-metal-organic-framework (MOF) based electrocatalysts. Finally, this review summarizes the various promising strategies to enhance the OER performance of electrocatalysts, and those include the electrocatalysts to achieve ~1000 mA cm−2 at relatively low overpotential with significantly high stability.
