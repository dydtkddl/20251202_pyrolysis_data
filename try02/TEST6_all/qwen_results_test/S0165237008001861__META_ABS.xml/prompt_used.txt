You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polymer degradation studies using laser pyrolysis-FTIR microanalysis In this study a new method (LP-FTIR) was introduced to promote the better understanding of polymer degradation, as well as the effect of flame-retardant additives. The technique is based on FTIR analysis of gaseous products which originate from laser induced decomposition in a specific combustion cell. In situ FTIR analysis of the gaseous degradation products, produced by pyrolysing various samples of polymer and flame-retarded polymer composites (in air or inert atmosphere) at different laser power (0.1–10W), allows their identification and quantification without loss of any component. Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and polypropylene (PP) were used as model substrate for setting the parameters and for investigation of dependence of the results and the reproducibility on the laser power and atmosphere. The method has been utilized for determining the degradation products of EVA/Al(OH)3/melamine borate flame-retarded composites, which were also characterized by FTIR coupled cone calorimeter technique. In order to study the chemical changes in solid phase LP-FTIR technique was combined with ATR-IR spectroscopy. Based on the results, the new and a conventional method (cone calorimeter-FTIR) were compared.
