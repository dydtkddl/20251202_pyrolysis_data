You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The rise of borophenes and their composites for optimized hydrogen production: A holistic review of material designs, properties, coordination chemistry, and catalytic performances The global push toward low-carbon energy systems has intensified the search for clean and efficient hydrogen (H2) production technologies. Wherein, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting offer sustainable alternatives to fossil-fuel-based H2 generation, yet their commercial application remains limited by the scarcity of cost-effective, stable, and high-performance catalysts. Recently, borophene, an emerging two-dimensional boron-based material, has attracted significant attention due to its unique physicochemical properties, including high electronic conductivity, mechanical strength, structural anisotropy, and tunable phases. These characteristics make borophene and its composites highly suitable for energy-related applications, particularly H2 production. Building upon this interest, in this review, we provide a systematic overview of borophene's preparation strategies, both bottom-up and top-down approaches, followed by a detailed discussion of its key physicochemical properties, such as electronic, optical, adsorption, superconducting, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical behaviors. Special emphasis is given to the H2 evolution reaction (HER), where borophene’s surface reactivity, high charge carrier mobility, and tunable adsorption energies play a pivotal role in enhancing catalytic efficiency. This review further examines the HER potential of borophene-based systems, including pure borophene sheets, phase-engineered borophene composites, and hybrid materials such as borophene/MXene, borophene/graphene, and borophene combined with metal oxides, sulfides, selenides, and nanoparticles. By consolidating theoretical insights and experimental findings, we identify key design principles and future directions for optimizing borophene-based materials for scalable H2 production. This work aims to bridge the knowledge gap between borophene’s fundamental material properties and its practical application in clean energy technologies.
