You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Functional polyesters via ring-opening copolymerization of α–hydroxy–γ–butyrolactone and ε-caprolactone: La[N(SiMe 3)2]3 as an efficient coordination-insertion catalyst The growing awareness of environmental concerns and the fossil resources depletion have raised the need to develop sustainable and degradable polymers such as aliphatic polyesters. γ-Lactone-based polyesters are of great interest today due to their ability to depolymerize. The introduction of functional groups appeared also useful to tune the properties of such polyesters. This can be addressed by the use of functional monomers such as the sugar-based α-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (HBL). In this study, the synthesis of random copolyesters of HBL and ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) was investigated via ring-opening copolymerization in the presence of La[N(SiMe 3)2]3 as a catalyst. High polymerization temperature (80 °C) was required for fast and high monomer conversions. The characterization of the copolyesters and kinetic investigations provided better insight into the polymerization mechanism and formation of various HBL monomer units (cyclic, linear and branched). La[N(SiMe 3)2]3 catalyst afforded high HBL conversion ratio (over 85 %) for the copolymerization reaction enabling the synthesis of copolyesters with a ratio of HBL units ranging from 9 to 63 %.
