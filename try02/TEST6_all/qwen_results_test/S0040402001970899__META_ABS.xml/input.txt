Reaction of benzyne with cycloheptatriene preparation and thermolysis of some benzo(C9H10) hydrocarbons The title reaction gave a 2+2 cycloadduct, 8,9-benzo-cis-bicyclo[5.2.0]nona-2,4,8-triene 7, together with ene product, 7-phenylcycloheptatriene. The structure of 7 was confirmed by catalytic reduction to give 8,9-benzo-cis-bicyclo[5.2.0]non-8-ene, which was also obtained in the reaction of benzyne with cycloheptene, and by reduction of the known 8,9-benzobicyclo[5.2.0]nona-1,8-diene. Other benzo(C9H10) hydrocarbons which have been synthesised are 7,8-benzobicyclo[4.2.1]nona-2,4,7-triene 5, 2,3-benzobicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene 28 and 4,5-benzobicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene 29. The thermolysis of 7, 28, 29 and of 3,4-benzo-exo-endo-tetracyclo[4.3.1.03,4.07,9]dec-3-en-10-one, 25, is described.
