You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction of benzyne with cycloheptatriene preparation and thermolysis of some benzo(C9H10) hydrocarbons The title reaction gave a 2+2 cycloadduct, 8,9-benzo-cis-bicyclo[5.2.0]nona-2,4,8-triene 7, together with ene product, 7-phenylcycloheptatriene. The structure of 7 was confirmed by catalytic reduction to give 8,9-benzo-cis-bicyclo[5.2.0]non-8-ene, which was also obtained in the reaction of benzyne with cycloheptene, and by reduction of the known 8,9-benzobicyclo[5.2.0]nona-1,8-diene. Other benzo(C9H10) hydrocarbons which have been synthesised are 7,8-benzobicyclo[4.2.1]nona-2,4,7-triene 5, 2,3-benzobicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene 28 and 4,5-benzobicyclo[6.1.0]nona-2,4,6-triene 29. The thermolysis of 7, 28, 29 and of 3,4-benzo-exo-endo-tetracyclo[4.3.1.03,4.07,9]dec-3-en-10-one, 25, is described.
