Distributed lump kinetic modeling for slurry phase vacuum residue hydroconversion A detailed distributed lumped kinetic model for slurry phase Vacuum Residue hydroconversion process (boiling range 525 + °C) has been constructed. Simulated distillation and Gel Permeation Chromatography analysis results were combined to estimate feedstock and product compositions over the whole boiling range. The model uses 21 distributed lumps to represent the hydrocarbons, takes hydrogen consumption into account and calculates reaction rates using molar concentrations. Vapour liquid mass transfer resistances and vapour-liquid equilibrium are also accounted for. The resulting model represents the evolution of the reaction mixture physical properties well and provides a good fit with the experimental data. From estimated parameters, it is deduced that thermally activated and catalytic reactions in cascade occur simultaneously and also that material boiling above 750 °C is converted in a different manner to lighter material.
