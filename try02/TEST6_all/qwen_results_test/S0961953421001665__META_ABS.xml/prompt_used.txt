You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of the influence of activated biochar properties on methane production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge This work describes the impacts of biochar (BC) addition to the anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste activated sludge (WAS). Three BCs, produced by pyrolysis at 550 °C of different waste biomasses (soft wood, sewage sludge and rice husk), then physically activated at 900 °C with CO2, were investigated as additives. AD tests were performed in batch mode at 37 °C, feeding 2% total solids and 10 g L−1 BC. While none of the considered BCs increased biogas yield compared to control digesters, the activated BCs with higher surface area, porosity and hydrophobicity (RH550a from rice husk and SS550a from sewage sludge) boosted methane yield (up to 105% for RH550a). The experimental methane production were: 0.037 Nm3 kgVS−1 for SWP550a, 0.081 Nm3 kgVS−1 for SS550a, 0.142 Nm3 kgVS−1 for RH550a and 0.069 Nm3 kgVS−1 for control reactors. CO2 adsorption (3.14 mmol g−1 for RH550a, 0.97 mmol g−1 SS550a) calculated from experimental data was consistent with literature (0.4–2.3 mmol g−1 BC). The fitting of experimental methane productions through the modified Gompertz equation showed an acceleration of methane production for all BCs, with a reduction of the lag phase compared to control reactors (0.5 days vs 2.6 days). This work, although confirming literature data about CO2 adsorption, brings new insights on the influence of specific physico-chemical properties of BC as additive in AD of WAS. Surface area, porosity, hydrophobicity and alkali and alkaline metals content in ashes were the most important BC properties affecting AD of activated sewage sludge.
