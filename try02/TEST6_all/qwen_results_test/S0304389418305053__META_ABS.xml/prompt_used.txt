You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic removal of mercury from waste carbonaceous catalyst by microwave heating Waste carbonaceous catalyst (WCC) from vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) production is a potential environmental threat due to the mercury toxicity. Microwave heating (MWH) was used to decontaminate WCC. Treatment temperature had a stronger influence on mercury removal than that of treatment time while mercury removal was highly depended on treatment time at lower temperature. When WCC was treated at 350 °C for 60 min, 400 °C for 30 min and 450 °C or more for 10 min, leaching toxicity of mercury conformed to the US EPA standard. 99.98% of total mercury was removed and residual mercury concentration was only 4.5 mg kg−1 when treated at 500 °C for 30 min. Soluble and exchangeable Hg and Hg combined with labile organics were more easily to be removed than that of Hg bound to crystalline Fe/Al oxides, Hg combined with non-labile organics and HgS. The removal limit for different mercury species may be achieved at 500 °C. Evaporation removal of mercury followed exponential decay model. Activation energy for mercury removal was reduced due to the catalytic effect of MWH. Removal mechanisms of mercury included thermal evaporation, breakdown of molecular bonds, selective stripping of carbonaceous impurities.
