BTEX in the environment: An update on sources, fate, distribution, pretreatment, analysis, and removal techniques BTEX are highly toxic environmental compounds that have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in humans. These components are ubiquitous in environmental samples like water, air, and soil, which increase the risk of human exposure. Therefore, it is necessary to develop rapid, inexpensive, accurate, sensitive, and efficient sample-preparation and analytical methods to detect BTEX, thus reducing the harmful effect of BTEX on the environment and human health. This research reviewed the sources, fate, and distribution of BTEX in the general environment. In addition, a comprehensive summary and comparison of the current determination methods and different removal techniques in various environmental samples is discussed in detail. Also, the analytical and removal challenges and the futuristic development strategies established for BTEX are provided. In conclusion, the current review presents comprehensive evaluation on cutting-edge technologies in the field of BTEX determination and removal.
