You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential for optimisation of fuel yield and hydrocarbon distribution from plastic waste pyrolysis using Nanopyroxene catalysts Plastic waste is a global concern, driven largely by the widespread use of single-use plastics. Despite advances in recycling technologies, scalable, and cost-effective plastic waste management solutions remain limited. Thermal pyrolysis offers a complementary pathway for plastic waste valorisation through energy recovery, but conventional processes are constrained by slow reaction rates, high energy demands, and low fuel yields. This study introduces, for the first time, nanopyroxene as a novel catalytic additive for plastic waste pyrolysis in a locally fabricated batch reactor, aiming to improve fuel yield and hydrocarbon distribution. A mixture of Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), High-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP) (2:1:2 ratio) was thermally decomposed under catalysed and non-catalysed conditions. The physico-chemical properties of the resulting plastic-derived fuel oils (PDFOs) were benchmarked against commercial diesel. Catalytic pyrolysis significantly increased the fuel oil yield to 77 %, compared to 56 % from non-catalytic pyrolysis (p 0.05) between PDFOs and commercial diesel in key fuel properties, all of which fell within recommended standards. However, PDFOs exhibited higher volatility, density, and flammability, with lower flash and fire points (39 °C, 48 °C), suggesting suitability for high-energy combustion applications. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanopyroxene to enhance fuel yield and quality from plastic pyrolysis, though further optimisation, detailed catalytic mechanisms, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments are necessary for large-scale adoption.
