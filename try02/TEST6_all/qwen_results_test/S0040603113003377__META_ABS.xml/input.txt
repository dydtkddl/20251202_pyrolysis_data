Thermal properties and flammability of ethylene-vinyl acetate rubbers (EVM) and their cross-linked blends with nitrile rubber (NBR) This paper presents the investigation results concerning the thermal stability, fire hazard and flammability of non-cross-linked and cross-linked EVM rubbers as well as their cross-linked blends with NBR. Thermal analysis was carried out under both air and inert gas within the temperature range of T =−100 to 700°C. The destruction activation energy of the materials investigated was determined with the use of two non-isothermal methods: Flynn-Wall-Ozawa's and Kissinger's methods. The fire hazard of the vulcanizates investigated was determined by means of a micro-calorimeter and the coupled TG-FTIR method. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the gaseous thermal decomposition products of the material tested were determined by the GC–MS technique.
