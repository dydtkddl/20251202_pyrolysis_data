You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dinitriles and nitriles are common intermediates of pyrrole pyrolysis Pyrrole is a typical fuel nitrogen model compound of coal and it is the precursor of fuel-NOx. The mechanism and kinetics of pyrrole pyrolysis were studied in a jet-stirred reactor coupled with a synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet molecular beam mass spectrometer and a gas chromometer over the temperature range of 940–1240 K at atmospheric pressure. Two sets of new data of pyrrole pyrolysis were provided. Based on the photoionization efficiency analysis, nitrogenous products are mainly produced in the form of nitriles and dinitriles. Of the pyrrole pyrolysis products, six nitriles were newly identified including methyl isocyanide (C2H3N), cyanogen (NCCN), isocyanogen (CNCN), propionitrile (C3H5N), propanedinitrile (C3H2N2), butanedinitrile (C4H4N2). Mole fractions of pyridine (C5H5N), C3H2N2, cyanovinylacetylene (C5H3N), and benzonitrile (C7H5N) were also quantified. HCN is the dominant nitrogenous product of pyrrole pyrolysis. C2H2 and CH4 are the major carbonaceous products. An updated pyrrole kinetic model was proposed comprising 196 species and 2939 reactions. The production of pyridine and several nitriles during pyrrole pyrolysis could be reasonably predicted using the current model. C3H2N2 is mainly produced by the reaction between CH2CN and other nitriles, and it is converted into CH2CN and CH3CN. The reaction between CH3 and C3H2N2 is the most sensitive reaction for promoting the consumption of C3H2N2. Results of this work confirm the importance of dinitriles and nitriles during the pyrolysis of pyrrole as an important fuel-NOx model compound of coal and other nitrogen-containing fuels.
