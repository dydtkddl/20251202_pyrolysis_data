You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental approach to the catalysed cracking reaction of tar from wood pyrolysis The purpose of this work is to examine the introduction of catalysts to the TNEE dual fluidized-bed pyrolysis process, in order to decrease the tar content of the gases. Two different sets of apparatus were constructed. In the first, tar is isolated and reinjected in a reactor where it undergoes a controlled pyrolysis; this allows the rate of reaction in the presence of different potential catalysts and under identical experimental conditions to be measured and compared. In the second, tar is mixed with the gases from the biomass pyrolysis, as in all comparable industrial processes since tar cracking consists of many different reactions, the only way of reaching reliable kinetic parameters is to study it at a very high degree of completion. The variation in the time necessary for tar to be “completely” pyrolyzed as a function of the reaction temperature for many different catalysts has been determined by special procedures. Metallic salts deposited on active and inactive supports, i.e. alumina, silica, silico-alumina, decarbonated and recarbonated dolomite, and various charcoals, have all been investigated. Among such preparations, Ni catalysts produce the highest activity; alkali and alkaline earth metal catalysts are less active but produce a gas with the highest content of hydrocarbons. Among the others, a high specific surface area activated charcoal presents the best catalytic activity but is consumed by the reaction. Decarbonated dolomite seems to be the best suited for use in an industrial process.
