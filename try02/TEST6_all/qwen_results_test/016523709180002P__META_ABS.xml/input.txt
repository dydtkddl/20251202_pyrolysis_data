Experimental approach to the catalysed cracking reaction of tar from wood pyrolysis The purpose of this work is to examine the introduction of catalysts to the TNEE dual fluidized-bed pyrolysis process, in order to decrease the tar content of the gases. Two different sets of apparatus were constructed. In the first, tar is isolated and reinjected in a reactor where it undergoes a controlled pyrolysis; this allows the rate of reaction in the presence of different potential catalysts and under identical experimental conditions to be measured and compared. In the second, tar is mixed with the gases from the biomass pyrolysis, as in all comparable industrial processes since tar cracking consists of many different reactions, the only way of reaching reliable kinetic parameters is to study it at a very high degree of completion. The variation in the time necessary for tar to be “completely” pyrolyzed as a function of the reaction temperature for many different catalysts has been determined by special procedures. Metallic salts deposited on active and inactive supports, i.e. alumina, silica, silico-alumina, decarbonated and recarbonated dolomite, and various charcoals, have all been investigated. Among such preparations, Ni catalysts produce the highest activity; alkali and alkaline earth metal catalysts are less active but produce a gas with the highest content of hydrocarbons. Among the others, a high specific surface area activated charcoal presents the best catalytic activity but is consumed by the reaction. Decarbonated dolomite seems to be the best suited for use in an industrial process.
