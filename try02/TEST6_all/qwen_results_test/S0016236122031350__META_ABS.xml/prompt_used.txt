You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of herbal medicine wastes over zeolite catalyst for aromatic hydrocarbons production Catalytic pyrolysis is an effective method to upgrade biomass pyrolytic bio-oil. In this study, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of licorice residue (LR) over ZSM-5 was conducted using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The effects of temperature, Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) and catalyst to feedstock (C/F) ratio on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) were investigated. The results indicated that ZSM-5 effectively converts oxygenates into AHs. Specifically, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene and naphthalene (BTEXN) were the dominant components. The pyrolysis temperature and acidity of zeolite exert a greater influence on the formation of BTEXN. The maximum content of BTEXN was 73.45 % at 500 °C and 72.21 % at lower SARs (27 and 36). Coke can be formed and deposited on the zeolite during CFP of LR, which cause the deactivation of catalyst. A higher pyrolysis temperature and C/F ratios inhibits the coke formation, while a higher SAR is beneficial to coke formation. The large oxygenated molecules and aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHCs) was the precursors of coke during catalytic pyrolysis. The coke was tended to disperse on the surface of catalyst at low temperature. However, it was largely deposited in the channels of zeolite catalyst at high temperatures. This study reveals that ZSM-5 is an effective catalyst for the utilization of herbal medicine wastes. The pyrolytic bio-oil has high potential for use in fuels or renewable chemical production.
