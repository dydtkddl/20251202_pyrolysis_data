You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent Advancements in the Surface Modification of Additively Manufactured Metallic Bone Implants Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the production of metal bone implants, enabling unprecedented levels of customization and functionality. Recent advancements in surface-modification technologies have been crucial in enhancing the performance and biocompatibility of implants. Through leveraging the versatility of AM techniques, particularly powder bed fusion, a range of metallic biomaterials, including stainless steel, titanium, and biodegradable alloys, can be utilized to fabricate implants tailored for craniofacial, trunk, and limb bone reconstructions. However, the potential of AM is contingent on addressing intrinsic defects that may hinder implant performance. Techniques such as sandblasting, chemical treatment, electropolishing, heat treatment, and laser technology effectively remove residual powder and improve the surface roughness of these implants. The development of functional coatings, applied via both dry and wet methods, represents a significant advancement in surface modification research. These coatings not only improve mechanical and biological interactions at the implant-bone interface but also facilitate controlled drug release and enhance antimicrobial properties. Additionally, micro- and nanoscale surface modifications using chemical and laser techniques can precisely sculpt implant surfaces to promote the desired cellular responses. This detailed exploration of surface engineering offers a wealth of opportunities for creating next-generation implants that are not only biocompatible but also bioactive, laying the foundation for more effective solutions in bone reconstruction.
