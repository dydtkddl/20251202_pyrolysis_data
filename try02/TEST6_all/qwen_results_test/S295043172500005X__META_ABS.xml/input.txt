Recent Advancements in the Surface Modification of Additively Manufactured Metallic Bone Implants Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the production of metal bone implants, enabling unprecedented levels of customization and functionality. Recent advancements in surface-modification technologies have been crucial in enhancing the performance and biocompatibility of implants. Through leveraging the versatility of AM techniques, particularly powder bed fusion, a range of metallic biomaterials, including stainless steel, titanium, and biodegradable alloys, can be utilized to fabricate implants tailored for craniofacial, trunk, and limb bone reconstructions. However, the potential of AM is contingent on addressing intrinsic defects that may hinder implant performance. Techniques such as sandblasting, chemical treatment, electropolishing, heat treatment, and laser technology effectively remove residual powder and improve the surface roughness of these implants. The development of functional coatings, applied via both dry and wet methods, represents a significant advancement in surface modification research. These coatings not only improve mechanical and biological interactions at the implant-bone interface but also facilitate controlled drug release and enhance antimicrobial properties. Additionally, micro- and nanoscale surface modifications using chemical and laser techniques can precisely sculpt implant surfaces to promote the desired cellular responses. This detailed exploration of surface engineering offers a wealth of opportunities for creating next-generation implants that are not only biocompatible but also bioactive, laying the foundation for more effective solutions in bone reconstruction.
