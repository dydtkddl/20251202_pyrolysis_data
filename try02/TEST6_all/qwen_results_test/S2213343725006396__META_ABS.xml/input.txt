Carbon aerogel with solid and magnetic coating prepared from freeze-thawed pomelo peel waste for oil adsorption This work shares a preparation and modification method of a sustainable oil adsorbent derived from pomelo waste. Firstly, the freeze-thawed pomelo peel is converted into hydrophobic carbon aerogel (PP3–300) via pyrolysis at 300℃. By dip-coating in the solution of γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) and Fe3O4, the aerogel forms a hard and magnetic shell (MPP). Compared to unfreeze-thawed pomelo peel, the porosity of PP3-300 increases, while the density decreases, leading to a doubling of the adsorption capacity, reaching up to 20–50 times its own weight. Additionally, the adsorption rate increases by 6 times. The modification of APTES and Fe3O4 enhances the hardness, wear-resistance, and magnetic properties of MPP. In this study, the freeze-thawing cycles is innovatively used to modify the pore structure of biomass, thereby doubled the adsorption capacity of pomelo peel without additional chemicals. Compared to other modifications, the APTES modification does not invade the aerogel's pores and fully preserves the original pore structure of the pomelo peel. MPP can effectively absorb oil from the water surface and can be recovered via magnetic force.
