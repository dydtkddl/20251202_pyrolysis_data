You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon aerogel with solid and magnetic coating prepared from freeze-thawed pomelo peel waste for oil adsorption This work shares a preparation and modification method of a sustainable oil adsorbent derived from pomelo waste. Firstly, the freeze-thawed pomelo peel is converted into hydrophobic carbon aerogel (PP3–300) via pyrolysis at 300℃. By dip-coating in the solution of γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) and Fe3O4, the aerogel forms a hard and magnetic shell (MPP). Compared to unfreeze-thawed pomelo peel, the porosity of PP3-300 increases, while the density decreases, leading to a doubling of the adsorption capacity, reaching up to 20–50 times its own weight. Additionally, the adsorption rate increases by 6 times. The modification of APTES and Fe3O4 enhances the hardness, wear-resistance, and magnetic properties of MPP. In this study, the freeze-thawing cycles is innovatively used to modify the pore structure of biomass, thereby doubled the adsorption capacity of pomelo peel without additional chemicals. Compared to other modifications, the APTES modification does not invade the aerogel's pores and fully preserves the original pore structure of the pomelo peel. MPP can effectively absorb oil from the water surface and can be recovered via magnetic force.
