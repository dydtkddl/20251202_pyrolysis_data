You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of plastics as hydrogen donor on catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose to produce monocyclic aromatics Hierarchical ZSM-5 (Z-40) was synthesized via a simple two-step hydrothermal crystallization without using any organic template. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as hydrogen donor was added into the catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose to enhance deoxygenation and the formation of BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene). Cellulose and LDPE showed the strongest synergistic effect at a feed ratio of 1, and the obtained experimental BTX yield (22.9 %) was 52.7 % higher than the theoretical yield (15 %). Co-catalytic pyrolysis (CCP) of two polymers followed similar cracking behavior to CCP of their pyrolysis vapor model compounds (furfural and n-octane), mainly including pyrolysis, catalytic cracking of pyrolysis fragments in external surface and hydrocarbons pool reactions of small cracking fragments in the internal micropores of zeolite. Z-40 showed better catalytic performance than the commercial ZSM-5 (higher BTX yield and less coke deposition) due to the appropriate acidic properties and distinctive pore structure. The optimal condition for CCP of cellulose/LDPE was temperature at 550 °C, feed ratio at 1:1 and catalyst/feed ratio at 2:1, and the achieved BTX yield reached 24.5 % with high BTX selectivity of 86.7 %. This work provided a cost-effective method for synthesis of ZSM-5 and production of high value-added BTX via a green non-oil route.
