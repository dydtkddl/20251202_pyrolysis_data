You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ pyrolysis of Undaria pinnatifida as a green carbo-catalyst for degradation of organic contaminants: Role of inherent N and P in the degradation pathway Tetracycline (TC) is one of the most used antibiotics for human, veterinary medicine, and food additives. The consumption of TC is not thoroughly utilized, and the residual TCs are released from the human and animal bodies by renal excretion. It leads to the accumulation of TC in the environment, which causes adverse effects on the ecosystem. Thus, it is necessary to remove TC from water bodies. The present study demonstrates a single-step biochar preparation method from seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) which can be applied for groundwater treatment. Physicochemical characterization of the seaweed-derived biochar (SWBC) reveals that pyrolysis temperature plays a crucial role in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and tetracycline (TC) degradation performance. Complete degradation of TC (10 mg L−1) was achieved in 60 min with 0.5 mM of PMS and 0.1 g L−1 of SWBC pyrolyzed at 800 °C (SWBC800). The TC removal trends were further verified by the pseudo- (PFOKM) and two-compartment (TCFOKM) first-order kinetic models. Chemical scavenger experiments and electron spin resonance spectra (ESR) confirmed that both radical (hydroxyl radical, HO, and sulfate radical, SO4 −) and non-radical (singlet oxygen, 1O2) reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed in the SWBC800/PMS system. The quantification of ROS was calculated to be 2.45 × 10−2, 1.97 × 10−2, and 4.05 × 10−2 mg min−1 for HO, SO4 −, and 1O2, respectively, indicating singlet oxygen is more dominant in the catalytic process. Furthermore, an electrochemical analysis also verified that a non-radical reaction mechanism and an electron-transfer pathway occurred in the SWBC800/PMS system. The SWBC800 catalyst with the PMS system successfully demonstrated reusability in TC degradation. Based on the toxicity analysis SWBC800 is found to be an eco-friendly catalyst for groundwater treatment.
