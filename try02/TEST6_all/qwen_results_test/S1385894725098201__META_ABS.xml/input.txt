Solid wastes microplastic and nanoplastic in water and wastewater: environmental impacts and recent advances in their electrocatalytic degradation focusing on anode materials on EAOPs Solid wastes microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have emerged as pervasive environmental pollutants due to their chemical stability, small size, and widespread distribution in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This comprehensive review critically examines the environmental impacts of MPs/NPs and evaluates recent advancements in their electrochemical degradation, with particular emphasis on anode materials employed in Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOPs). EAOPs have shown remarkable potential for MP/NP degradation through the in-situ generation of powerful reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radicals ( HO • ) and sulfate radicals ( SO 4 • − ). The performance of these processes is highly dependent on the choice of anode material, with non-active anodes (e.g., boron-doped diamond (BDD), PbO2, SnO2, and Ti4O7) demonstrating superior efficiency due to their high overpotential for oxygen evolution and ability to produce weakly adsorbed HO • radicals. In contrast, active anodes (e.g., RuO2, IrO2 and Ta2O5) are more effective in chloride-rich media through the generation of active chlorine species. Recent innovations, such as modified anode materials, chlorine based- electrolytes, H2O2 and surfactant-assisted electrooxidation, hybrid systems combining electrooxidation (EO) with ultrasound (UEO) or photoanode (PEO), and flow-through microfiltration electrochemical reactors, have significantly enhanced degradation efficiency. However, challenges remain in terms of energy consumption, electrode stability, and the potential formation of toxic byproducts. This review underscores the need for further research to optimize reactor designs, develop cost-effective electrode materials, and integrate renewable energy sources to improve process sustainability. Additionally, it highlights the importance of policy interventions to regulate microplastic emissions and promote advanced treatment technologies. By addressing these challenges, EAOPs can emerge as a viable solution for mitigating the growing threat of MPs/NPs pollution in water systems.
