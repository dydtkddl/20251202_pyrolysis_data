Decomposition of NO over Cu-ZSM-5 Zeolites A Transient Kinetic Study Transient kinetic method has been utilized to investigate the mechanism of NO dcomposition over Cu-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts prepared by solid state ion exchange of the H+ form with CuCl2 at 800 K. At higher temperatures the activity decreased and the decomposition was found to be of first order with respect to the NO in the ranges of 0.4–2 vol% NO in the range of 600–750 K. The apparent energy for activation was found to be 36k J mol−1. The TPD of NO revealed three peaks one of them being at 690 K corresponds to the working temperature range of the catalyst. Isothermal transients during NO pulses indicated reversible poisoning of the catalyst by NO and oxygen. N2 overshoot at the leading edge and O2 peak at the tailing part of the pulse was also observed. The rate of reaction under the steady state condition was controlled by the desorption of O2 which in turn was hindered by NO.
