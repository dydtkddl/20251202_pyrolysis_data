You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolysis with reactive molecular dynamics PE pyrolysis is considered as an important process for converting plastic solid waste into fuel or other valuable chemicals to alleviate the environmental burdens. A computational approach can be of help for fully understanding the mechanisms and reaction pathways during PE pyrolysis in various industrial applications. In this paper, ReaxFF molecular dynamics was for the first time applied in simulating the pyrolysis of a High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) model system with 7216 atoms. Detailed reaction mechanisms and generation pathways of primary gas molecules were obtained by further analysis of the trajectories within a total of 250 ps simulation in NVT ensemble at 2000–3000 K using a newly created program, VARMD. The product profile and primary gas products evolution tendencies with temperature agree reasonably with the observations in Py-GC/MS experiments and literature data. The overall kinetics of ∼ C31 were analyzed and used to predict the reaction time for 90% weight loss of HDPE thermolysis that falls in around the reported time observed experimentally in the literatures. The reaction mechanisms based on the detailed reactions from the simulation trajectories are in broad agreement with what reported in literatures. The work presented here validates that ReaxFF MD is a promising method to help building a systematic understanding of the detailed chemical reactions in pyrolytic process for polymers.
