Nordic perspectives on the emerging biochar business Biochar production offers various benefits related to climate change mitigation, circular economy, waste management, renewable energy, and reduced dependency on fossil carbon. Despite these advantages, the biochar market in the Nordic region is still developing. This study explores the current state and future potential of the Nordic biochar market, identifying existing and potential market segments, the role of biochar and its co-products, and factors affecting market growth. The study involved an online survey conducted in 2021, targeting key Nordic biochar stakeholders, including business actors, academic researchers, and other relevant groups (N = 72, representing 64 organizations). The findings reveal that the Nordic biochar market is in its nascent stages, with producers often considering biochar production as a side business. The market faces challenges such as inadequate legal and policy support, limited public awareness, lack of established norms, and uncertainties regarding profitability, technological efficiency, and market potential. However, the industry holds substantial growth potential due to its environmental and climate benefits, provided that current barriers are overcome. Key applications of biochar include carbon removal, water filtration, soil remediation, landscaping, and composting. Additionally, co-products such as energy-dense gases and bio-oil have the potential to enhance the economic viability of biochar production. To facilitate market development, integrating established scientific knowledge into industry standards and policies is crucial. The study underscores the importance of biochar networks and associations in advocating for industry development and highlights the need for enhanced collaboration among stakeholders to overcome existing barriers. Additionally, focused research on the varied applications of biochar is needed, with an emphasis on thoroughly evaluating its environmental, economic, and social impacts.
