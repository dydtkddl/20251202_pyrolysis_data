You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nordic perspectives on the emerging biochar business Biochar production offers various benefits related to climate change mitigation, circular economy, waste management, renewable energy, and reduced dependency on fossil carbon. Despite these advantages, the biochar market in the Nordic region is still developing. This study explores the current state and future potential of the Nordic biochar market, identifying existing and potential market segments, the role of biochar and its co-products, and factors affecting market growth. The study involved an online survey conducted in 2021, targeting key Nordic biochar stakeholders, including business actors, academic researchers, and other relevant groups (N = 72, representing 64 organizations). The findings reveal that the Nordic biochar market is in its nascent stages, with producers often considering biochar production as a side business. The market faces challenges such as inadequate legal and policy support, limited public awareness, lack of established norms, and uncertainties regarding profitability, technological efficiency, and market potential. However, the industry holds substantial growth potential due to its environmental and climate benefits, provided that current barriers are overcome. Key applications of biochar include carbon removal, water filtration, soil remediation, landscaping, and composting. Additionally, co-products such as energy-dense gases and bio-oil have the potential to enhance the economic viability of biochar production. To facilitate market development, integrating established scientific knowledge into industry standards and policies is crucial. The study underscores the importance of biochar networks and associations in advocating for industry development and highlights the need for enhanced collaboration among stakeholders to overcome existing barriers. Additionally, focused research on the varied applications of biochar is needed, with an emphasis on thoroughly evaluating its environmental, economic, and social impacts.
