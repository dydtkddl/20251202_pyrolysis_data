You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing heavy metals filtration: Synergistic effects of banana peel-derived activated carbon and layered double hydroxides in ultrafiltration membranes This study presents a novel approach for enhancing the performance of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes in removing heavy metals from wastewater by incorporating banana peel-derived activated carbon (BPAC) and ternary layered double hydroxides (LDH) into a polyethersulfone (PES) matrix. BPAC was synthesized via pyrolysis and fused into the polymeric matrix using the phase inversion technique. The developed PES-BPAC membranes exhibited higher permeability and maximum rejection compared to control membranes, attributed to the highly porous nature of BPAC. Further functionalization of the PES-BPAC membrane with Mg-Al-Fe-LDH at concentrations ranging from 4 to 16 % resulted in superior performance, with the 12 %LDH-BPAC membrane exhibiting the highest water flux of 354.6 LMH and 91.7 % rejection of Ni2+ ions. The superior composite membrane was tested in cross-flow and dead-end filtration and electrically regenerated to ensure long-term applicability. Comparative analysis with existing membranes and regeneration ability confirmed the commercial potential of the developed membranes for effective heavy metal removal from wastewater streams. This study highlights the synergistic effects of BPAC and LDH in enhancing UF membrane performance, providing an innovative and sustainable approach to wastewater treatment and biomass waste management.
