Recent progress in the recycling of spent graphite anodes: Failure mechanisms, repair techniques, and prospects Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (S-LIBs) is an effective strategy for addressing environmental concerns and the increasing demand for critical energy minerals. This process involves the recyclization of spent graphite (S-Gr), a key component of LIB anodes, which has been less studied compared to the recovery of high-value elements from the cathode. Despite its lower market value, graphite possesses unique properties and plays a vital role in LIBs, emphasizing the need for innovative recycling solutions due to the economic and environmental impacts of graphite extraction and processing. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the failure mechanisms and structural characteristics of S-Gr, offering valuable insights into the complexities of graphite anode recyclization. Existing methodologies and advancements in S-Gr recyclization are thoroughly summarized. Additionally, surface modification strategies for S-Gr recovery are analyzed, aiming to repair the damaged surface structure and restore its electrochemical performance. Finally, the prospects and challenges associated with S-Gr recyclization are presented, contributing to the sustainable development of LIB technologies and promoting the global transition toward renewable energy sources.
