You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exergoeconomic assessment of CHP-integrated biomass upgrading The objective of this work is to assess the exergoeconomic performance of three biomass upgrading processes, namely wood pellets, torrefied wood pellets and pyrolysis slurry (a mixture of pyrolysis char and oil), integrated with a municipal combined heat and power plant. The work is a continuation of work published earlier (Kohl et al., 2013) and the same simulation model results are used as input for the calculation of the exergy flows within the system. Economic data of the assessed processes has been obtained from the literature and has been combined with the exergy data following the specific exergy costing approach in order to perform the exergoeconomic analysis. The highest exergy destruction is caused in the combustion equipment, whereas the upgrading processes appear highly efficient. The systems’ exergetic efficiency can be improved by 22%, 26% and 31% for the integration with pyrolysis slurry, torrefied wood pellets and wood pellets, respectively, making wood pellets the most efficient integration option. However, the integration of pyrolysis slurry production yields the highest profit under the projected price scenario. In addition it also reacts moderately on possible price fluctuations as is shown in a sensitivity analysis. Considering the generally acknowledged future technical potential of pyrolysis products for replacing fossil oil-based products transport fuel production as well as the commonly expected further price increase for fossil oil, pyrolysis slurry constitutes as the best option to be integrated with the municipal combined heat and power plant.
