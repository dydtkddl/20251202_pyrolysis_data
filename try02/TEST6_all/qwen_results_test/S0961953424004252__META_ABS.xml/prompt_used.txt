You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the mechanism of hydrogen production from bamboo gasification in supercritical water by ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation In the context of sustainable development, biomass and clean energy have garnered significant attention. At present, the inefficient utilization of biomass leads to a significant waste of resources. Supercritical water gasification technology not only facilitates the resourceful utilization of biomass but also generates hydrogen. This paper presents a molecular dynamics simulation study on bamboo as the subject for investigation, complemented by experimental validation to ascertain the efficacy of the simulation outcomes. The bamboo model is prepared by mixing Crystalline Cellulose Iβ, (1 → 4)-β-D-xylopyranose, α-L-arabinofuranose-(1 → 3)-β-D-xylopyranose, and two syringyl units connected by a β-O-4 bond in a ratio of 46:13:15:26. The study analyzes the influence of various parameters on the gasification results and elucidates the gasification reaction mechanism of bamboo in supercritical water. The results indicate that at a reaction temperature of 4300 K and a feedstock concentration of 5 wt%, the H₂ yield reaches 85.6 % of the total output. Additionally, the reactive force field molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the SCWG process of bamboo, providing theoretical support for improving gasification efficiency. The simulation results show that bamboo decomposition is accompanied by chain cleavage, ring-opening reactions, and the formation of small molecules. Furthermore, the study explored the formation pathways of carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
