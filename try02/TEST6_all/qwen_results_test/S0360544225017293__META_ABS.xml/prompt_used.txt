You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction of product yields and heating value of bio-oil from biomass fast pyrolysis: Explainable predictive modeling and evaluation In this study, optimized ensemble learning algorithms were employed to predict and analyze the product distribution and higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil from biomass fast pyrolysis, based on feedstock characteristics, operating conditions, and reactor parameters. The results reveal that pyrolysis temperature, biomass carbon and hydrogen content, and feedstock volatile matter are the most influential factors for achieving high bio-oil yield, while deoxygenation pretreatment and moderate pyrolysis temperatures (approximately 500 °C) are critical for enhancing HHV. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses further elucidated the complex interactions among these parameters, providing actionable insights for optimizing pyrolysis processes. Additionally, the developed ML models demonstrated robust predictive accuracy, with R2 values exceeding 0.93 for bio-oil yield prediction, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to facilitate practical applications. Finally, when evaluated on the external dataset, the optimized LightGBM model demonstrates a moderate linear relationship between predicted and true values, achieving an accuracy of approximately 80 %, with a peak of 84 %. The residual distribution reflects strong generalization capabilities, validating the effectiveness of the optimization strategy. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of biomass pyrolysis behavior and valuable guidance for industrial process optimization.
