You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Superficial Pd nanoparticles supported on carbonaceous SBA-15 as efficient hydrotreating catalyst for upgrading biodiesel fuel Facile synthesis of superficial Pd nanoparticles supported on carbonaceous SBA-15 (denoted as Pd/@SBA-15) as a new hydrotreating catalyst with enhanced activity and sulfur tolerance was accomplished for the production of partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME), a high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monosaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME) that can be used in high blends. Characterization, especially high-resolution electron microscopes and temperature-programmed techniques, indicated that the Pd nanoparticles (∼7 nm) formed spontaneously at the superficial area of carbonaceous SBA-15 with a hydrophobic surface and low acidity. In the synthesis of H-FAME using commercial palm oil-derived biodiesel fuel as a feedstock under mild conditions (<100 °C, 1 MPa), this new Pd/@SBA-15 catalyst offered high hydrotreating activity with excellent selectivity toward mono-FAME, especially the cis product, and high sulfur resistance, presumably due to fast diffusion and suitable interactions of the reactant and hydrogenated molecules through superficial Pd nanoparticles on the carbonaceous surfaces as the catalytically active sites. On the other hand, commercial Pd catalysts with Pd nanoparticles randomly impregnated inside the supporting materials showed lower activity in H-FAME synthesis and poorer selectivity toward saturated fatty acid methyl esters as undesirable products and lower sulfur tolerance level per Pd site, demonstrating the superiority of our system.
