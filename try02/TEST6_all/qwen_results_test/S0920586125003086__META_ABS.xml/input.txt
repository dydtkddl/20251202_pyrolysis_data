Enhanced hydrodeoxygenation of biocrude using NiMo carbide catalysts Agricultural feedstocks such as oilseeds-derived meals have high oxygen content, which ends up in the biocrude during hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), resulting in lower energy density and poor stability of the biocrude produced. Oxygen removal through hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is essential for improving biocrude quality. While conventional sulfided NiMo and CoMo/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used for conventional crude oil hydrotreatment, hydrochar-based catalysts have gained interest due to their carbon neutrality, high stability, durability, and cost-effectiveness. In this study, sawdust-derived hydrochar via HTL was functionalized with nitric acid to enhance oxygen functional groups from 5.4 wt% to 27.9 wt%, providing effective support for NiMo catalysts. The resulting functionalized hydrochar support, impregnated with 15 wt% Mo and 5 wt% Ni, demonstrated high deoxygenation performance (65.2 %) for biocrude produced from canola and mustard meals. XPS analysis confirmed the presence of active carbide phases, which played a crucial role in enhancing HDO selectivity and efficiency. For pure biocrude with an initial oxygen content of 9.2 wt%, HDO optimized using the Box-Behnken design achieved a minimum oxygen content of 3.2 wt% at 375 °C, 5.9 h, and 3.41 wt% catalyst loading. To assess the effect of solvent on HDO, a 50:50 biocrude-ethyl acetate blend was employed, resulting in a minimum oxygen content of 3.4 wt% under optimized conditions of 377.2 °C, 1.6 h, and 3.3 wt% catalyst loading. HDO of pure biocrude preserved longer hydrocarbon chains, maintaining carbon integrity, whereas the presence of the solvent promoted excessive cracking. The products distribution and reaction pathways were further investigated using GC-MS, NMR, and simulated distillation to gain insight into the influence of solvent addition during the HDO of HTL-derived biocrude.
