Research progress on pyrolysis gasification and resource utilization of tobacco waste: Component analysis and recovery strategies Tobacco waste represents a unique biomass resource due to its high content of nicotine and alkaloids, distinct from conventional agricultural residues.These components, along with its abundant cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, impart special characteristics to its pyrolysis and gasification products. This review systematically examines the composition of tobacco waste and its influence on the distribution of products—biochar, tar, and syngas—during Pyrolysis and gasification.conversion. Key findings highlight the potential for obtaining high-value chemicals such as phenols and nicotine-derived compounds from tar, producing syngas (H₂/CO/CH₄) for energy applications, and applying biochar for soil remediation. Future research should focus on (1) advanced extraction of nicotine, (2) heavy metal removal, (3) tar upgrading, and (4) process scale-up to enhance the economic and environmental feasibility of tobacco waste valorization.
