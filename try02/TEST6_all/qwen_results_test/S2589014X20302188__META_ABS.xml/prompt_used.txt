You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics of Tepidimicrobium xylanilyticum as a lactate-utilising bacterium in polylactic acid decomposition during thermophilic anaerobic digestion Global production of polylactic acid (PLA) is projected to increase to approximately 0.33 million tons by 2024. Therefore, better understanding of the biological mechanism of PLA decomposition is essential for waste management. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of lactate accumulation on PLA depolymerisation and identify the lactate-utilising bacteria (LUB) during thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD). Evaluation of PLA decomposability and characterisation of the isolate cultivated from PLA-treated TAD were conducted using batch testing. In high lactate concentrations, 34%–44% reduction of physicochemical PLA depolymerisation was observed, suggesting that LUB were important lactate scavengers for rapid PLA depolymerisation process. The isolate EN5CB1 was identified as Tepidimicrobium xylanilyticum; however, several of its characteristics differed from that of the PML14T. Strain EN5CB1 demonstrated high lactate consumption and H2, CO2, and acetate productivity. These findings provide new insights into the role of T. xylanilyticum in PLA treatment through TAD.
