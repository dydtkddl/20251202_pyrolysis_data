Optimization of process parameters for the photophysical synthesis of colloidal Ag, Au, and Cu nanoparticles using femtosecond laser ablation in water Nanoparticle (NP) synthesis employing pulsed laser ablation of a target in liquids (PLAL) offers ligand-free NPs with relatively narrow size distributions that may be further laser treated to produce monodisperse colloids. Targets of group IB metals silver, gold, and copper were used to study the influence of the femtosecond laser processing parameters on the NP synthesis yield, size distribution, and plasmonic properties of the NPs. It was determined that efficient NP synthesis reaching 6 mg/h in ultra-pure water for different metals takes place at quite different Yb:KGW femtosecond laser pulse densities (10 000 p/mm for Ag and Cu, 50 000 p/mm for Au) and fluences (6.1 J/cm2 for Au and Cu, 3.0 J/cm2 for Ag). Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) analysis of PLAL synthesized NPs has shown a similar electron-phonon coupling relaxation time constant ca. 1 ps and revealed their differences in decay processes for all three investigated metals. Different aging properties of the NPs were observed, where silver and gold colloids were stable for months, while some of the copper samples tended to oxidize and were stable only for days.
