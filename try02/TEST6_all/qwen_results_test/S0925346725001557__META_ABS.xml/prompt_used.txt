You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of process parameters for the photophysical synthesis of colloidal Ag, Au, and Cu nanoparticles using femtosecond laser ablation in water Nanoparticle (NP) synthesis employing pulsed laser ablation of a target in liquids (PLAL) offers ligand-free NPs with relatively narrow size distributions that may be further laser treated to produce monodisperse colloids. Targets of group IB metals silver, gold, and copper were used to study the influence of the femtosecond laser processing parameters on the NP synthesis yield, size distribution, and plasmonic properties of the NPs. It was determined that efficient NP synthesis reaching 6 mg/h in ultra-pure water for different metals takes place at quite different Yb:KGW femtosecond laser pulse densities (10 000 p/mm for Ag and Cu, 50 000 p/mm for Au) and fluences (6.1 J/cm2 for Au and Cu, 3.0 J/cm2 for Ag). Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) analysis of PLAL synthesized NPs has shown a similar electron-phonon coupling relaxation time constant ca. 1 ps and revealed their differences in decay processes for all three investigated metals. Different aging properties of the NPs were observed, where silver and gold colloids were stable for months, while some of the copper samples tended to oxidize and were stable only for days.
