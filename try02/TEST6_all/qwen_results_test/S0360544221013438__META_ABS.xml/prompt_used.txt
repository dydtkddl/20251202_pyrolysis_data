You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics and kinetic analysis of pyrolysis of forestry waste promoted by microwave-metal interaction In the present work, a method of pyrolyzing forestry waste (FW) under microwave-metal interaction was proposed. The kinetic analysis of the process was carried out using a microwave thermogravimetric analyzer. The mechanism of FW pyrolysis under microwave-metal interaction was discussed from the perspective of microwave-induced metal discharge and non-discharge processes. The initial pyrolysis temperature T i reduced, and the maximum pyrolysis rate R m and pyrolysis characteristic index S increased by employing a method where microwave and metal were coupled. The number of metals inserted also significantly affected the pyrolysis behavior. R m in the presence of one metal was 92.3% higher than that recorded in the absence of metal. The results of kinetic analysis revealed in the presence of metal, the activation energies at 400 W and 560 W were 51.7% and 57.5% lower, respectively, than the activation energy recorded in the absence of metal. Multiple effects of light, heat, and plasma produced by microwave-induced discharge caused the local pyrolysis of FW. The promotion of FW pyrolysis in the non-discharge stage was primarily caused by the microwave absorption of carbon into heat and the conversion of current on the metal surface into Joule heat.
