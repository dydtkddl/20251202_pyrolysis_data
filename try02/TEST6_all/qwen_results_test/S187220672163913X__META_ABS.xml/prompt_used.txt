You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

M/C3N4/AC (M = Au, Pt, Ru)-catalyzed acetylene coupling with ethylene dichloride: How effective are the bifunctionalities? Acetylene coupling with ethylene dichloride, which uses both coal and oil resources, is attractive for sustainable PVC manufacturing. Herein, highly active and stable carbon nitride-based catalysts were developed by a novel pre-oxidation-pyrolysis process, affording unprecedented dehydrochlorination activity with good durability. The best-performing system was further modified with different precious metals (Au, Pt, and Ru) to promote the hydrochlorination chemistry between the in-situ formed hydrogen chloride and acetylene co-feed. The presence of metal centers intensifies the hydrochlorination activity but weakens the dehydrochlorination ability due to competitive adsorption between the two reactants at the metal sites. Superior coupling performance was achieved over C3N4/AC and single-atom Au/C3N4/AC catalysts in cascade reactors. Our results strongly suggest that dehydrochlorination is an essential step in the coupling reaction, and the activation of acetylene and ethylene dichloride molecules requires different active sites that should be engineered in future work.
