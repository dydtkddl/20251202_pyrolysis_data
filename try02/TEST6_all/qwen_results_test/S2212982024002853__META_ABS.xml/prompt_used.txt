You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of the activation heating source on the carbon capture performance of two new adsorbents produced from household-mixed-plastic waste This study reveals the impact of the activation with microwave and conventional heating sources on textural properties and CO2 uptake of a mixed plastic-based char. Two mixed plastic-based adsorbents, one activated using microwaves and the other using conventional heating, were produced at optimum activation conditions, and subsequently compared. The findings show that both heating sources produced microporous adsorbents, but activation heating sources influenced their physicochemical properties and CO2 uptake. The microwave-produced activated carbon (AC) displayed superior BET surface area, total, micro- and ultra-micropore volumes compared to the conventionally produced AC. The microwave-produced AC possessed CO2 adsorption capacities of 1.66 and 2.37 mmol/g under dynamic and equilibrium conditions, respectively, at 25 °C and 1 bar. These capacities represent an 8 and 30 % higher uptake, respectively, compared to the 1.53 and 1.66 mmol/g displayed by the conventionally prepared AC under the same adsorption conditions. Both samples displayed stable and excellent CO2 recyclability over 10 adsorption-desorption cycles, with desorption efficiencies ranging from 93.46 % to 96.72 % (microwave- and conventionally- produced ACs respectively). The Avrami model most accurately described the experimental CO2 adsorption data under dynamic conditions, while the Sip model gave the best fit for equilibrium conditions. These findings apply to both types of ACs at various temperatures, irrespective of the heating source. Overall microwave heating is more efficient than conventional heating, requiring 300°C lower temperature, 115 minutes shorter time, 0.79 kWh less energy, and less KOH. It improves CO2 uptake and reduces production costs by 80 %, offering a sustainable alternative for CO2 adsorbent production.
