You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation of pyrolysis process for waste plastics using Aspen Plus: Performance and emission analysis of PPO-diesel and PPO-biodiesel blends As the global population increases, so does the usage of plastics in households, water bottles, and garbage bags, posing significant environmental threats. Plastics, being inorganic waste with long degradation periods, contaminate air, water, and soil when disposed of in landfills. Given the rise in global plastic production, effective waste management strategies are essential. This study utilized Aspen Plus simulation to analyze the pyrolysis process of waste plastics, specifically PE, PS, and LDPE. Simulations were conducted with temperature variations between 350 °C and 550 °C to determine the optimum conditions. Additionally, the study compared engine performance and emissions using mixtures of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO), biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO), and diesel. Engine performance tests were conducted with variations in engine speed and load for PPO-diesel and PPO-biodiesel mixtures. Simulation results showed that the optimal pyrolysis temperature for the highest PPO yield was 450 °C, producing 89 % for PS plastic. Pyrolysis at 500 °C yielded 85 % oil for PE, 83 % for LDPE, and 60 % for mixed plastics. Engine performance tests indicated that adding PPO to diesel and WCO biodiesel significantly affected engine performance and emissions. A 5 % PPO blend in diesel demonstrated better brake thermal efficiency and lower BSFC compared to higher PPO blends.
