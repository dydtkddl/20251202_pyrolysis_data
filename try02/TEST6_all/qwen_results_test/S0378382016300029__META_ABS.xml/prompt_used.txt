You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of surrounding conditions and fuel size on the gasification rate of biomass char in a fluidized bed While the operational conditions of a fluidized bed are known to influence the fuel axial mixing, the effect of the resulting axial location of the fuel particles on the char gasification rate remains unexplored. In this work, a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidized bed was used to investigate how the gasification rate of biomass char was influenced by the fuel axial location (during pyrolysis and char gasification), the pyrolysis atmosphere, the fuel size, and the fuel concentration. When pyrolysis at the bed surface was followed by char gasification inside the dense bed the char gasification rate was up to 2-fold lower than the other combinations of the fuel axial location, which held similar rates. Cooling the char after pyrolysis decreased the char gasification rate in all cases studied. The gasification rate increased when the fuel particle size was decreased, and its dependence on the degree of char conversion was also affected. Thus, the operational conditions of a fluidized bed reactor, through modified fuel axial mixing, can influence the char gasification rate. Furthermore, experimental determination of reactivity data in laboratory-scale systems must account for the axial location of the fuel at the desired end-scale, using similar fuel particle sizes.
