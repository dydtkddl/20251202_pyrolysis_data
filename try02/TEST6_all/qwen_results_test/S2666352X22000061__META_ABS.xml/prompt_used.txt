You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapor to bio-aromatics hydrocarbon: A review In order to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution, the production of bio-aromatics from renewable biomass resources has become an effective way. However, due to the complexity of the composition and structure of biomass resources, the conversion mechanism of bio-aromatics is relatively complex, and the problems such as low yield of target products, poor selectivity and deactivation of catalysts limit its further application. Therefore, it is necessary to understand deeply the mechanism of biomass conversion to highly selective bio-aromatics. Although considerable progress has been made in the development of bio-aromatics from biomass, the detailed process and reaction mechanism of bio-aromatics are still lack of a comprehensive summary. This paper reviews the latest progress in the development of biomass to bio-aromatics, including biomass raw materials and biomass-derived model compounds, catalysts, hydrogen-rich reagents, synergistic catalysis on aromatics selectivity. The effects of process conditions on the yield of bio-aromatics were discussed, and the advantages, disadvantages of various catalysts and product characteristics were compared in detail. The mechanism and pathways for bio-aromatic via different catalysts and hydrogen-rich reagents was discussed in detail. Some challenges and prospects were put forward for the existing problems of this technology, which provided an important theoretical basis for the preparation of high value-added bio-aromatics in the field of biomass catalytic pyrolysis in the future.
