Advanced catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis vapor to bio-aromatics hydrocarbon: A review In order to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution, the production of bio-aromatics from renewable biomass resources has become an effective way. However, due to the complexity of the composition and structure of biomass resources, the conversion mechanism of bio-aromatics is relatively complex, and the problems such as low yield of target products, poor selectivity and deactivation of catalysts limit its further application. Therefore, it is necessary to understand deeply the mechanism of biomass conversion to highly selective bio-aromatics. Although considerable progress has been made in the development of bio-aromatics from biomass, the detailed process and reaction mechanism of bio-aromatics are still lack of a comprehensive summary. This paper reviews the latest progress in the development of biomass to bio-aromatics, including biomass raw materials and biomass-derived model compounds, catalysts, hydrogen-rich reagents, synergistic catalysis on aromatics selectivity. The effects of process conditions on the yield of bio-aromatics were discussed, and the advantages, disadvantages of various catalysts and product characteristics were compared in detail. The mechanism and pathways for bio-aromatic via different catalysts and hydrogen-rich reagents was discussed in detail. Some challenges and prospects were put forward for the existing problems of this technology, which provided an important theoretical basis for the preparation of high value-added bio-aromatics in the field of biomass catalytic pyrolysis in the future.
