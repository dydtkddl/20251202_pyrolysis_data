You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface integrity in metal machining - Part II: Functional performance Material removal operations play a pivotal role in the manufacture of key components, required for engineering systems to operate safely and efficiently under ever more advanced functional requirements and over extended life cycles. To further step up the loading capability of machined parts, fundamental understanding of how of machining-induced features can influence the performance of advanced materials under complex service conditions is necessary over finer temporal and spatial scales. As discussed in Part I of this review, when engineering surfaces are generated by material removal processes, a wide range of physical mechanisms (e.g. mechanical, thermal, chemical and their combinations) drive the characteristics of workpiece surface integrity. In Part II of this review, the interplay between the metallurgical and micro-mechanical condition induced by material removal processes and their in-service response will be thoroughly explored, by a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in the field. Specifically, attention is focused on recent advances made towards the understanding of the mechanisms determining the resistance of machined surface to fatigue crack nucleation (Section 2), corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking (Section 3), and wear (Section 4). Furthermore, the impact of relevant post-machining treatments on the in-service behaviour of machined surfaces is analysed, and the possible strategies for the enhancement of the functional performance of machined surfaces are presented (Section 5). Finally, the current research gaps and the prospective challenges in understanding the in-service behaviour of machined surfaces are critically discussed, providing an interpretation of the possible directions of future scientific development of this field.
