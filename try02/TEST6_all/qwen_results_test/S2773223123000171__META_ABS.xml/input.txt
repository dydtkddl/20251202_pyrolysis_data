Metal-based catalysis for biomass and renewables valorization- current status Biomass, a renewable and carbon neutral energy source, is highly promising within the upcoming decades for addressing several consumer goods and fuel requirements of humankind. Using catalysts in the biomass valorization industry increases the recyclability of feedstock, offers higher selectivity in products, reduces environmental impact, and controls the reactivity of the procedures. In this review, we have scrutinized the status of the development of multifunctional metal-based catalysts that can help convert various biomass into high-value fine goods. The catalytic systems have been divided into subgroups to deeply study their structural characteristics and active sites towards intrinsic reactivity and selectivity in the transformation of biomass intermediates, which mostly occurs via hydrolysis, dehydration, hydrodeoxygenation, and oxidation pathways In this review, we mainly focus on the role and significance of metal oxide-based catalysts, metal-oxide supported catalysts, heteropoly acids, aluminosilicates, and mesoporous catalysts in biomass valorization. Recent developments in photocatalytic materials for the oxidation of small molecules produced from biomass (such sugars, alcohols, and carboxylic acids) and lignin model compounds are described, as well as the function of various heteroatoms in enhancing photo-electronic characteristics. Bimetallic catalytic systems' acid-base supports and metal nanoparticulate sites work together synergistically to enable one-pot multistep cascade reactions.
