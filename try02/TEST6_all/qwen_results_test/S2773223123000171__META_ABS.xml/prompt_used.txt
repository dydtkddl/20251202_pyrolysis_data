You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-based catalysis for biomass and renewables valorization- current status Biomass, a renewable and carbon neutral energy source, is highly promising within the upcoming decades for addressing several consumer goods and fuel requirements of humankind. Using catalysts in the biomass valorization industry increases the recyclability of feedstock, offers higher selectivity in products, reduces environmental impact, and controls the reactivity of the procedures. In this review, we have scrutinized the status of the development of multifunctional metal-based catalysts that can help convert various biomass into high-value fine goods. The catalytic systems have been divided into subgroups to deeply study their structural characteristics and active sites towards intrinsic reactivity and selectivity in the transformation of biomass intermediates, which mostly occurs via hydrolysis, dehydration, hydrodeoxygenation, and oxidation pathways In this review, we mainly focus on the role and significance of metal oxide-based catalysts, metal-oxide supported catalysts, heteropoly acids, aluminosilicates, and mesoporous catalysts in biomass valorization. Recent developments in photocatalytic materials for the oxidation of small molecules produced from biomass (such sugars, alcohols, and carboxylic acids) and lignin model compounds are described, as well as the function of various heteroatoms in enhancing photo-electronic characteristics. Bimetallic catalytic systems' acid-base supports and metal nanoparticulate sites work together synergistically to enable one-pot multistep cascade reactions.
