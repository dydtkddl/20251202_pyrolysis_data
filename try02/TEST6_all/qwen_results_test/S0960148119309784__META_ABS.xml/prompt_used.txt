You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Anaerobic co-digestion of the process water from waste activated sludge hydrothermally treated with primary sewage sludge. A new approach for sewage sludge management Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a suitable technology for managing wastes with a high moisture content, providing a carbon-rich and high energy density material called hydrochar and a process water (PW) with significant organic matter content. The aim of this work was to develop a new approach to sewage sludge management involving anaerobic digestion (AD) of the PW of dewatered waste activated sludge (DWAS) with primary sewage sludge (PSS). The process was optimized by performing semi-continuous experiments with different feed mixture compositions (10% PW/90% PSS and 5% PW/95% PSS, on a COD basis), organic loading rates (OLR; 1.5 and 2.5 g COD L−1 d−1), and temperature regimes (mesophilic and thermophilic). The combination of mesophilic conditions, a 10% PW/90% PSS feed mixture and OLR of 1.5 g COD L−1 d−1 provided concentrations of volatile fatty acids <400 mg COD L−1 in addition to a methane yield (172 ± 11 mL CH4 g−1 CODadded), 1.15 times the value for the control test (100% PSS). Therefore, the energy content of hydrochar from HTC of DWAS followed by AD of the process water with primary sewage sludge enhances the valorization of this renewable residue.
