You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of metal-organic frameworks/graphitic carbon nitride composites for solar-driven green H2 production, CO2 reduction, and water purification The rapid increase in population growth and economic development led to the increase in utilization of fossil fuels energy per capita. Thus, the consumption of these fossil fuel's energy resources poses serious implications for our environment. Photocatalysis plays an essential role in sustainable energy development and environmental remediation. The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been efficiently employed in photocatalysis due to its abundance, low price, high stability, appropriate band gap, and encouraging environmental impacts. As the photocatalytic efficiency of single component g-C3N4 is still not satisfactory for efficient photocatalysis. Hence, its composites with various functional nanomaterials have been widely prepared and employed for efficient photocatalysis. Among the widely coupled functional nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely explored for energy production and controlling environmental pollution due to their large surface area, tunable pore size and window, and tailored functionalities. The significance of MOF/g-C3N4 composites flourished for green hydrogen (H2) production, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion, and environmental pollution control. In this review, we comprehensively highlighted the recent advancements and challenges of g-C3N4 and MOFs heterojunctions in the field of green H2 production. Besides, we discussed the up-to-date applications of g-C3N4-based composites with MOFs for CO2 conversion to useful fuels. Furthermore, the association between MOFs and g-C3N4 composites and their performance for water purification are also discussed. Finally, we proposed the future potential of MOF/g-C3N4 composites to be used for the generation of green energy in order to solve environmental issues. We suggest that this review can help to design MOF/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts for prospective applications in energy harvesting and controlling environmental pollution.
