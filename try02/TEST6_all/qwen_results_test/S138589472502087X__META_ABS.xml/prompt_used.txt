You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of monolith reactor design for autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over a MoVTeNbOx catalyst We use a multi-scale coarse-grained reduced order model that accounts for pore diffusion to analyze the ignition-extinction behavior during oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) in a monolith reactor coated with a MoVTeNbOx (M1) catalyst. We determine the optimal catalyst layer thickness and monolith substrate properties so as to maximize the region of autothermal operation (or per pass conversion of ethane) as well as selectivity to ethylene. Our modeling results indicate that metallic monoliths with intermediate length, high substrate conductivity and high cell density (or small hydraulic radius) are optimal to approach the so called “homogeneous lumped thermal reactor (LTR) limit” which leads to the best reactor performance. It is also shown that operation of the reactor in the external mass or heat transfer controlled regime with strong interphase gradients can lower ethylene selectivity. We also report the feasibility of carrying out ODHE at high pressure (5 bar) with fixed linear velocity and examine the impact of feed dilution on reactor performance and compare the same with that obtained in the steam cracking of ethane.
