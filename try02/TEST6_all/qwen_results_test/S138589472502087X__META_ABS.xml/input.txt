Optimization of monolith reactor design for autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over a MoVTeNbOx catalyst We use a multi-scale coarse-grained reduced order model that accounts for pore diffusion to analyze the ignition-extinction behavior during oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) in a monolith reactor coated with a MoVTeNbOx (M1) catalyst. We determine the optimal catalyst layer thickness and monolith substrate properties so as to maximize the region of autothermal operation (or per pass conversion of ethane) as well as selectivity to ethylene. Our modeling results indicate that metallic monoliths with intermediate length, high substrate conductivity and high cell density (or small hydraulic radius) are optimal to approach the so called “homogeneous lumped thermal reactor (LTR) limit” which leads to the best reactor performance. It is also shown that operation of the reactor in the external mass or heat transfer controlled regime with strong interphase gradients can lower ethylene selectivity. We also report the feasibility of carrying out ODHE at high pressure (5 bar) with fixed linear velocity and examine the impact of feed dilution on reactor performance and compare the same with that obtained in the steam cracking of ethane.
