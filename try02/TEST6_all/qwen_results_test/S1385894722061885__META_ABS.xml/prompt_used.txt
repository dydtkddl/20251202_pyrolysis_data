You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bayesian tuned kinetic Monte Carlo modeling of polystyrene pyrolysis: Unraveling the pathways to its monomer, dimers, and trimers formation The current kinetic models for polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis contain many simplifications to reduce their size and the corresponding simulation time. Moreover, they are often based on rate coefficients determined using non-ideal experimental data featuring ambiguous process conditions with respect to mixing and temperature uniformity. The practical interest of PS pyrolysis is the production of styrene monomer to be reused as a feedstock in the polymerization of styrene. In the present work, a lab-scale tree-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model is presented that differentiates between 18 reaction families and 26 end-group pairs to study the product yield variations for thermal degradation of PS. Model parameters follow from Bayesian optimization to experimental data recorded with an in-house micro-pyrolysis unit coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. Low chain length (CL) anionic-made PS is specifically considered to gain an understanding of the role of specific end-groups. The experimental yields of the major products (monomer: 74.7–80.8 wt%, dimer: 5.1–5.5 wt%, trimer: 1.6–7.7 wt%) are well-predicted with the fine-tuned parameters. The main reaction pathway in the formation of styrene monomer is end-chain β-scission, while mid-chain β-scission is primarily involved in the formation of the styrene dimer and trimer. Our model shows that the pyrolysis of low CL anionic-made PS leads to better rate coefficients than those obtained from state-of-the-art pyrolysis of long CL PS, in which end-groups play a much smaller role.
