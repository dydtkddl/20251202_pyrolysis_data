Recent developments on metal hydride hydrogen compressors – A comprehensive review It is well known that hydrogen is the most abundant, which has the potential to play a significant role towards Sustainable Development. One of the major challenges of the hydrogen economy is its storage in a compressed gaseous form for onboard applications. This issue can be addressed with an employment of Type IV/Type V cylinders, however, the main challenge is to compress hydrogen to high pressure (i.e. > 700 bar) using low grade energy. A thermally-driven metal hydride hydrogen compressor (TD-MHHC) can be a promising and suitable method to compress hydrogen without causing any significant environmental damage. In addition, the type and thermodynamics of metal hydrides play a crucial role in the compression performance. Optimisation of specific features such as plateau pressure, slope factor, hysteresis, and cycling stability is essential for efficient performance. In this comprehensive review, the different types of hydrogen compressors are compared, in addition, various classes of metal hydrides are presented with suitable applications. Later, various metal hydrides (72 MHs) are employed to estimate the thermodynamic performance of MHHC i.e. compressor work, efficiency, and compression ratio, in addition to techno economic analysis. The maximum efficiency of MHHC is estimated as 48 % using LaNi4.61Mn0.26Al0.13 whereas the maximum compression ratio of 84.5 is obtained for MmNi4.8Al0.3 at absorption temperature of 20°C and desorption temperature of 150°C.
