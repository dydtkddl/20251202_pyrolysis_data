You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments on metal hydride hydrogen compressors – A comprehensive review It is well known that hydrogen is the most abundant, which has the potential to play a significant role towards Sustainable Development. One of the major challenges of the hydrogen economy is its storage in a compressed gaseous form for onboard applications. This issue can be addressed with an employment of Type IV/Type V cylinders, however, the main challenge is to compress hydrogen to high pressure (i.e. > 700 bar) using low grade energy. A thermally-driven metal hydride hydrogen compressor (TD-MHHC) can be a promising and suitable method to compress hydrogen without causing any significant environmental damage. In addition, the type and thermodynamics of metal hydrides play a crucial role in the compression performance. Optimisation of specific features such as plateau pressure, slope factor, hysteresis, and cycling stability is essential for efficient performance. In this comprehensive review, the different types of hydrogen compressors are compared, in addition, various classes of metal hydrides are presented with suitable applications. Later, various metal hydrides (72 MHs) are employed to estimate the thermodynamic performance of MHHC i.e. compressor work, efficiency, and compression ratio, in addition to techno economic analysis. The maximum efficiency of MHHC is estimated as 48 % using LaNi4.61Mn0.26Al0.13 whereas the maximum compression ratio of 84.5 is obtained for MmNi4.8Al0.3 at absorption temperature of 20°C and desorption temperature of 150°C.
