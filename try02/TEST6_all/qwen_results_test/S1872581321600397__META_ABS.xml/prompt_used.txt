You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on direct conversion of Naomaohu coal pyrolysis heavy oil to aromatics The pyrolysis tar from Naomaohu coal was separated by distillation apparatus. Four components of heavy oil above 320°C were analyzed. The result showed the colloid content was 28.84% and the asphaltene content was 35.12%, and both were difficult to convert in hydrogenation. 13C-NMR results showed that the relative molar ratio of aromatic carbon in heavy oil was 71.16%, which indicated that aromatic compounds in heavy fraction were dominant. The heavy fraction was treated by suspension bed and fixed bed cracking. The asphaltene and colloid were almost completely converted. The yield of naphtha with boiling point below 180°C was 66.95%, and the diesel with boiling point higher than 180°C was 17.84%. Oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur contained in heteroatoms were almost completely removed. Catalytic reforming of naphtha was carried out. The results showed that the number of cycloalkanes decreased by 60.23%, and the number of aromatics increased by 65.8%, which indicated that the dehydrogenation and aromatization of cycloalkanes occurred mainly. While the number of n-alkanes decreased by 13.42%, which indicated that the isomerization and cyclization of n-alkanes occurred simultaneously. The catalytic reforming oil contained more benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene, and the contents were 11.97%, 23.15%, 21.43% and 3.48% respectively. In the direct conversion process of heavy oil from coal pyrolysis, the transmissibility of basic structural units of coal was significantly reflected.
