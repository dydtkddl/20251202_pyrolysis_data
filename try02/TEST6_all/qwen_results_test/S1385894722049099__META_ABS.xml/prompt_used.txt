You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A synergistic route of heterointerface and metal single-atom configurations towards enhancing microwave absorption Derivatized multi-void composite microplates (CoNXC) were successfully fabricated for high-efficient electromagnetic wave absorption (EMA) using a two-step pyrolysis process assisted by molten dual-salt-mediated template. Structural analysis indicated that cobalt single atoms coexisted stably with Co nanoparticles in the derived carbon matrix, exhibiting the coupling of Co/graphite heterointerface. Various bonding configurations of Co/N atoms could be modulated by N-doping, in which the percentage of Co-NX single-atom coordination ranged from 18.58 % to 37.62 %, including CoN2, CoN3 and CoN4 configurations. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the Co/graphite heterointerface and the Co single-atom configurations could significantly change the charge status and distribution, and synergistically promote dielectric polarization relaxation and electrons transport, which was in favor of strengthening the dielectric loss capacity. Benefiting from these, CoNXC remained high EMA performance even with filler loading of 10 wt%. In this regard, CoN20C exhibited strong RL peaks in multiple bands involving C-, X- and Ku-band, and its RLmin value reached −63.4 dB at 8.3 GHz, which were superior to most reported derivatized carbon-based composites. This work not only elucidates the synergistic mechanism of EMA by metal single-atom coordination and heterointerface, but also provides a new strategy for developing advanced carbon-based absorbers.
