Kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of garden waste gasification for clean syngas production This study investigates the gasification of pelletized garden waste with high ash content in a pilot-scale downdraft fixed-bed gasifier, integrating experimental reactor data with thermal decomposition kinetics via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Garden waste pellets were analyzed at heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 °C/min using the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM), yielding activation energies ranging from 46.56 kJ/mol (α = 0.1) to 122.12 kJ/mol (α = 0.9). The optimal gasification condition was observed at an equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.37, producing syngas with 16.76 ± 1.18 % H2 and 9.46 ± 0.84 % CO, and a lower heating value (LHV) of 4.17 ± 0.06 MJ/Nm3. Maximum cold gas efficiency (CGE) and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) reached 60.62 ± 1.22 % and 80.95 ± 2.37 %, respectively. Tar content decreased from 2.2 ± 0.05 to 0.72 ± 0.02 g/Nm3 with increasing ER, and GC–MS analysis identified phenolic compounds (e.g., 40.01 % 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol) as dominant species. Kinetic–performance correlation revealed that high activation energy at later stages (α > 0.7) coincides with increased thermal demand and slagging, influenced by ash constituents (e.g., CaO, SiO2). The integration of DAEM kinetics and reactor performance offers a predictive framework for optimizing waste-to-energy systems using heterogeneous, ash-rich biomass.
