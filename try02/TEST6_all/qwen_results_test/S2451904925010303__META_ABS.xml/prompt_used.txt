You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of garden waste gasification for clean syngas production This study investigates the gasification of pelletized garden waste with high ash content in a pilot-scale downdraft fixed-bed gasifier, integrating experimental reactor data with thermal decomposition kinetics via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Garden waste pellets were analyzed at heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 °C/min using the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM), yielding activation energies ranging from 46.56 kJ/mol (α = 0.1) to 122.12 kJ/mol (α = 0.9). The optimal gasification condition was observed at an equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.37, producing syngas with 16.76 ± 1.18 % H2 and 9.46 ± 0.84 % CO, and a lower heating value (LHV) of 4.17 ± 0.06 MJ/Nm3. Maximum cold gas efficiency (CGE) and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) reached 60.62 ± 1.22 % and 80.95 ± 2.37 %, respectively. Tar content decreased from 2.2 ± 0.05 to 0.72 ± 0.02 g/Nm3 with increasing ER, and GC–MS analysis identified phenolic compounds (e.g., 40.01 % 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol) as dominant species. Kinetic–performance correlation revealed that high activation energy at later stages (α > 0.7) coincides with increased thermal demand and slagging, influenced by ash constituents (e.g., CaO, SiO2). The integration of DAEM kinetics and reactor performance offers a predictive framework for optimizing waste-to-energy systems using heterogeneous, ash-rich biomass.
