Chemical looping gasification of high-moisture content biomass: The interactions between H2O and oxygen carrier The control and utilization of water is crucial during chemical looping gasification of high-moisture-content biomass waste. In this study, digestate, as a typical high-moisture-content biomass, was selected as the feedstock. Three types of gasification conditions, including self-moisture pyrolysis (SMP), self-moisture CLG (SMCLG), and externally injected steam CLG (SCLG), were tested to comparatively investigate the effects of different types of H2O on CLG. The transformation of H2O during gasification and the interactions between H2O and LaCu0.5Fe0.5O3 OC were also explored. Results showed that, SMCLG showed the best performance, and the highest gasification efficiency reached 81.83% when the self-moisture content was 40%. The characterization results showed that OC could absorb H2O at low temperature and release it at higher temperature, thus facilitating the gasification of pyrolytic char. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the migration path of H2O on OC was explained. The adsorption of H2O was mainly due to the formation of FeO bond between Fe and H2O, and then H2O dissociated into OH and H on Fe atom. H is transferred to La atom to form LaH. This study investigated the effect of OC on the migration and transformation of H2O in CLG, which provided a new perspective and development direction for the engineering treatment of digestate, as well as scientific support for the promotion and application of CLG.
