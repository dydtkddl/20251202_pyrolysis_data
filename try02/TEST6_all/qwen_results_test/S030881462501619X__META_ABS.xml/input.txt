Thermally optimized subcritical water hydrolysis for green extraction of bioactive compounds from sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus This study investigated the bioactive compounds in Stichopus japonicus extracts obtained using subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) at nine temperatures (115 °C–235 °C at 15 °C intervals). Increasing temperature enhanced the extraction efficiency and decreased the average molecular weight, extracts had abundant amino acids and phenolic compounds. Maximum protein (832.66 ± 15.00 mg BSA/g) and polysachchrides (32.02 ± 0.88 mg glucose/g) contents were achieved at 175 °C, while the highest phenolic content (23.93 ± 0.16 mg GAE/g) and antioxidant activity were observed at 220 °C. The highest α-amylase (18.62 % ± 1.17 %) and α-glucosidase (24.31 % ± 1.43 %) activities were observed at 115 °C. However, there was no significant trend between temperature and anti-inflammatory or anticholesterol activities. GC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of bioactive compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anticholesterol potential. In conclusion, our results indicate that SWH is a sustainable approach for extracting bioactive compounds from S. japonicus, with promising applications in functional foods and therapeutics.
