You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermally optimized subcritical water hydrolysis for green extraction of bioactive compounds from sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus This study investigated the bioactive compounds in Stichopus japonicus extracts obtained using subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) at nine temperatures (115 °C–235 °C at 15 °C intervals). Increasing temperature enhanced the extraction efficiency and decreased the average molecular weight, extracts had abundant amino acids and phenolic compounds. Maximum protein (832.66 ± 15.00 mg BSA/g) and polysachchrides (32.02 ± 0.88 mg glucose/g) contents were achieved at 175 °C, while the highest phenolic content (23.93 ± 0.16 mg GAE/g) and antioxidant activity were observed at 220 °C. The highest α-amylase (18.62 % ± 1.17 %) and α-glucosidase (24.31 % ± 1.43 %) activities were observed at 115 °C. However, there was no significant trend between temperature and anti-inflammatory or anticholesterol activities. GC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of bioactive compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anticholesterol potential. In conclusion, our results indicate that SWH is a sustainable approach for extracting bioactive compounds from S. japonicus, with promising applications in functional foods and therapeutics.
