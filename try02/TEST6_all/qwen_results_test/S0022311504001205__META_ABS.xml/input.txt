The European integrated materials and technology programme in fusion The paper reviews the present EU long-term programme, which is focused on the R&D of the materials and key technologies needed for the DEMO reactor. The mission of the EU power plant conceptual study, some major results and its consequences on future materials development are reported. Thereafter, the EU portfolio is presented including: material R&D from ferritic–martensitic steels and enhanced ODS steels to materials for high temperature application (SiC/SiC and tungsten), theoretical modeling of irradiation effects, the unique effort in building a fusion nuclear database on activation and transport files and codes, design activities for TBMs for ITER and DEMO as well as R&D and design performed for IFMIF.
