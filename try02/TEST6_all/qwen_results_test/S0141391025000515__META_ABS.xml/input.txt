Recent advancements in upcycling of polyolefins by hydrocracking: Effect of various heterogeneous catalysts and reaction parameters Plastic production and usage are increasing daily, leading to a rise in the disposal of plastic waste. However, recycling plastic waste is limited, posing a threat to human and environmental systems. The chemical recycling method is superior to mechanical and other recycling methods as it produces chemicals and various fuel hydrocarbons. Hydrocracking, a chemical recycling method, has the advantage of directly producing saturated fuel hydrocarbons. This review primarily focuses on the hydrocracking of various waste polyolefins (PO) using different heterogeneous catalysts. Zeolites and metal oxides have been explored more in hydrocracking polyolefins. Zeolite-supported metal catalysts promote hydrocracking efficiency due to their bi-functional characteristics. The review also elaborates on the influence of different reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, solvents, additives like heavy residue, and biomass. Waste plastic acts as a hydrogen donor while co-hydrocracking with biomass due to the high H/C ratio. Each section discusses various examples and summarizes different catalysts and their product distribution. Finally, the hydrocracking mechanism is discussed, and recent advancements and progress in this field are addressed in each section.
