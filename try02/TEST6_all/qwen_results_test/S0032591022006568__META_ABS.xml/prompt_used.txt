You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution by coal gangue-based zeolite granules in a fluidized bed: Fluidization characteristics and continuous adsorption Methylene blue (MB) pollution in wastewater has become an environmental problem. Batch and continuous adsorption experiments were performed to study the adsorption mechanism of MB by coal gangue-based zeolite granules in a fluidized absorber. The results showed that MB adsorption of coal gangue-based zeolite granules was mainly chemical adsorption in a fluidized bed, which was mainly affected by its size fraction (d), fluid velocity (v), bed weight (m), and initial concentration (c o ). Under suitable operating conditions (d ≤ 0.5 mm, v = 1.3 v mf (i.e., minimum fluidization velocity), m = 100 g, and c o = 100 mg/L), the fluidized bed formed by zeolite granules had the best adsorption performance for MB, with an adsorption saturation of 0.444 g/g and an equilibrium uptake of 108.041 mg/g, which is higher than that of the traditional packed bed. The results provide a theoretical basis for the industrial application of coal gangue-based zeolite granules.
