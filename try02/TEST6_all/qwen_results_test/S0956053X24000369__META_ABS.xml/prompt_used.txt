You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction of MSW pyrolysis products based on a deep artificial neural network Pyrolysis is a promising method for recovering resources and energy products from municipal solid waste (MSW). Predicting MSW pyrolysis products is crucial for establishing an efficient pyrolysis system for resource recovery. In this study, a database was established based on MySQL to record relevant information on MSW pyrolysis, which includes the MSW ultimate analysis results, proximate analysis results, parameters of pyrolysis operation and yields of pyrolysis products, etc. Based on the database and with help of a deep artificial neural network (ANN) which contains 10 hidden layers, a prediction model was successfully established to predict the yield of char, liquid and gas products from MSW pyrolysis. The results showed that the coefficients of determination for predicting the yields of char, liquid and gas from the MSW pyrolysis are 0.841, 0.84, and 0.85, respectively; these values demonstrate an accuracy comparable to that achieved for product prediction from single biomass, indicating a successful model performance. The results also show that ash content and temperature are the most important input factors influencing the outputs, namely, yields of char, liquid and gas. The results of this study can help to achieve a more efficient design of the pyrolysis system and improve the recovery of the desired pyrolysis products.
