You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of low-density polyethylene into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through continuous microwave pyrolysis with ex-situ dual-catalyst beds The single-use of polyolefins-based individual protective equipment has led to the rapid generation of substantial plastic waste. This study aimed at cleaner disposal of the polyolefin waste, and carried out the continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over dual-catalyst beds of MCM-41 and HY. The dual-catalyzed trial was able to produce more condensate fractions with higher selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), compared with using only MCM-41 or HY zeolite. It was because the larger pore size of the MCM-41 catalyst (4.00 nm) could crack long-chain polyolefin intermediates into shorter chains. This alleviates steric and diffusional resistance while entering and exiting the micropores of the HY zeolite (0.74 × 0.74 nm). The maximum liquid yield (63.75 wt%) and MAHs selectivity (78.21%) were achieved at a catalysis temperature of 450 °C, feedstock to catalyst ratio of 8:3, and HY to MCM-41 ratio of 2:1. In addition, the performance of the CMP reactor was also compared favorably with the batch microwave pyrolysis (BMP) reactor under the same conditions. It has been found that the CMP reactor generated more MAHs products, whereas the BMP reactor was more selective for the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and gas products. The combination of CMP and the co-catalysis process offers new insight into sustainable management and value-added recovery of medical plastic waste.
