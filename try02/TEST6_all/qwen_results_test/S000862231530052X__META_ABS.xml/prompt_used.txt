You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The chemical transformation of hydrocarbons to carbon using SO3 sources To develop low-cost carbon fiber, The Dow Chemical Company and others have explored the sulfonation of polyethylene fibers as an alternative to the incumbent poly(acrylonitrile) route. Although the process of polyethylene sulfonation and subsequent thermal carbonization in an inert atmosphere has been known to provide carbonaceous material for over 35years, we have found the chemical understanding of this transformation to be insufficient. Herein, we report a series of studies that have led to our current understanding for both the sulfonation and subsequent thermal treatment steps. Sulfonation of hydrocarbon model compounds yields completely conjugated and functionalized products. Spectroscopic data suggest that sulfonated polyethylene is similar; containing extended conjugated systems with sulfonic acids and various other oxygen-containing functional groups. Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure data have identified that between 150 and 200°C the polymer undergoes a cross-linking step, while evolved gas analysis has identified concomitant release of SO2 and H2O. Above 600°C, H2 is produced and a graphenic carbon microstructure is obtained.
