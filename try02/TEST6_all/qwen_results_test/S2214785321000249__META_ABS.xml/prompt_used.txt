You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of scrap tire by utilizing zeolite as catalyst Pyrolysis of waste tyres has been taken along 2 stage bed reactor. Waste tyres has been 1rst pyrolysis under perfect bed reactor, letter included pyrolysis gases has been forwarded by secondary catalytic reactor involved along 2 kinds of zeolite catalysts, which has been ultras table HY type & ZSM-5 catalyst. The Temperature of catalytic has been calculated regards observing issues on yield of products through waste tyres pyrolysis catalyst. Under this paper outputs shows that along enhance temperature of catalytic yield of gas enhanced at increase of yield of oil. It was describing that there was dramatic enhancement under concentration regards single ring aromatic compounds under fraction regards catalysis of derived oils. A un-catalyst tire pyrolysis was carried out under this paper, under order to correlate the pyrolysis of idle tires along the HY Impetus & ZSM-5 Impetus. The pyrolysis temperature was changed through 450 to 600 OC the impulses were replaced along similarly sized Such like ignorance reached counts under fraction of light around 11.63 wt%, o-xylen 4.40 wt%, benzene 1.7 wt% & m/p-xylen 12.3 wt% along HY catalyst, at temperature of pyrolysis, temperature of catalysis & ration of catalyst tyre around 400, 500 & 0.5, Under which light fraction is around 70.8 wt% under derived oil. Waste tires Synergist pyrolysis uses catalyst of zeolite HY & ZSM-5 which was observed related to effect regards temperature of reactant under yield items. Results show that effect of ZSM5 & catalyst zeolite HY has been to prove diminish yield regards oil along confirming enhancement under yield of gas.
