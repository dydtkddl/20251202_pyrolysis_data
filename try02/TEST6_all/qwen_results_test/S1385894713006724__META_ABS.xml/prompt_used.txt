You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Applying new kinetic and deactivation models in simulation of a novel thermally coupled reactor in continuous catalytic regenerative naphtha process Naphtha reforming unit occupies a key position in refineries to obtain high octane gasoline and BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) components which are the basic substances of petrochemical industries. In this study, a novel thermally coupled reactor for continuous catalytic regenerative naphtha process has been proposed to boost the aromatics and hydrogen productions and to produce aniline as a valuable product. In this configuration, the naphtha reforming (endothermic reaction) and nitrobenzene hydrogenation (exothermic reaction) reactions are carried out simultaneously. According to complex kinetic of reforming process a new kinetic model including 32 pseudo components with 84 reactions is proposed. As well, a novel catalyst deactivation model considering acidic and metallic functions of catalyst is presented to predict the behavior of the reactions which subject to the catalyst deactivation. Mathematical modeling of coupled reactor is considered in two dimensions (radial and axial directions). In order to assess the performance of the new configuration, the modeling results of thermally coupled reactor (TCR) is compared with the obtained results of conventional reactor (CR). By employing coupled reactors, aromatics production rates is improved acceptably (about 92kmol/h in comparison with conventional system), and the amount of produced hydrogen is increased greatly (190kmol/h compared to CR).
