You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physicochemical characterization, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of chitosan film containing Sauropus androgynus extract prepared by solution casting and supercritical impregnation Sauropus androgynus extract (SAE) was incorporated with chitosan to produce solution casting film (SAE-SCF) and supercritical impregnation film (SAE-SIF). The physicochemical characterization and biological activities of SAE-SCF and SAE-SIF films were evaluated and compared. In terms of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC), SAE-SCF (TPC: 49.14–71.88 mg GAE/g; TFC: 32.73–57.05 mg QE/g) obtained higher results than SAE-SIF (TPC: 8.40–18.90 mg GAE/g; TFC: 1.97–12.34 mg QE/g). FTIR results confirmed the interaction between SAE-active compounds and chitosan via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction. Due to the formation of hydrogen bonding or cross-linking effects in SAE-chitosan film, the light opacity (1.748–3.375 AU), water vapor permeability (2.87–3.92 × 10−11 g m−1.s−1.Pa−1), and mechanical properties (tensile strength; 8.65-15.72 MPa; elongation at break: 7.95–13.25%) were enhanced compared to neat chitosan film, with SAE-SCF showing higher performances than SAE-SIF. The antioxidant activities of both films were evaluated using ABTS (IC50: 55.98–97.85 μg/mL) and DPPH assays (IC50: 53.68–143.04 μg/mL), with SAE-SCF showing higher inhibition of free radicals than SAE-SIF. The ferric-reduction power was recorded (28.17–94.95 Trolox μmol/mL), and SAE-SCF achieved a higher reduction power than SAE-SIF. In antimicrobial analysis, SAE-SCF demonstrated the best reduction of viable growth of all tested foodborne microorganisms. Overall, the functional performance of SAE-SCF is better than SAE-SIF in all tested aspects. The results revealed the potential of SAE-SCF to be utilized as a food packaging material.
