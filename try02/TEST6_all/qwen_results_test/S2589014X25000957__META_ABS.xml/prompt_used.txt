You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modified Sugarcane leaf biochar for remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from wastewater: Activation, optimization, mechanism Adsorbents from biomass, particularly biochar, have shown great efficacy in treating wastewater because of their easy synthesis and favorable surface properties. Economic considerations are crucial for biochar to be a sustainable biosorbent in the long run. Sugarcane, a globally abundant crop, provides valuable post-harvest waste that can be converted into high-quality biochar. This study explores producing activated biochar from sugarcane leaves using CO2 to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from wastewater. Naphthalene (NAP) and Phenanthrene (PHE) were used as model PAHs for the study. Using response surface methodology, synthesis conditions were optimized, achieving an activated biochar with a surface area of 382.04 m2/g and a yield of 19.57 %. PAHs batch adsorption experiments were conducted, and depending on the process parameters, a removal efficiency of 88 – 90 % was achieved. Cost analysis showed that producing 1 kg of sugarcane leaf-activated biochar costs $1.37, with a removal cost of $0.030 to $0.035 per gram of PAHs. These findings indicate the potential of activated biochar from sugarcane leaves as an effective, cost-efficient adsorbent for PAH remediation in wastewater.
