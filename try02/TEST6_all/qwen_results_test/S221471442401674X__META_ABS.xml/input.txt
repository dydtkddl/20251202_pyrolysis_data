Efficient removal of pollutants using microfluidics liquid-liquid extraction: A comprehensive overview Recent decades have witnessed significant progress in microfluidic technology, propelled by its advantages such as minimal sample volume requirements, swift response times, enhanced safety, and cost-effectiveness. This study aims to evaluate the use of microfluidic liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in the removal of various environmental pollutants, with a special focus on heavy metals and dyes from wastewater. By leveraging the advantages of microchannels—such as improved mass transfer and increased surface areas—this research highlights the efficiency of these systems in pollutant extraction compared to traditional methods. Through experimental investigations, we identified optimal conditions for the extraction of pollutants such as dyes and heavy metals using different microchannel designs and operational parameters. These findings highlight the potential of microfluidic LLE systems as a powerful tool for environmental remediation, addressing the pressing challenge of water pollution. Although the removal of heavy metals has been thoroughly investigated with this technique, the study of other pollutants remains relatively unexplored. Future research should focus on expanding the application of microfluidics to other types of pollutants and refining the technology for larger-scale environmental applications.
