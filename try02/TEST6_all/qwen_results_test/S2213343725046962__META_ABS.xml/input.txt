Membrane bioreactor strategies for enhanced microplastic removal in wastewater: A review Microplastics (MPs), as emerging contaminants, are widely detected in municipal wastewater due to their potential toxicity and bioaccumulation, raising increasing environmental concerns. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs), through the synergistic effects of membrane filtration and biological degradation, have demonstrated significant advantages in MPs removal. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the application of MBRs for MPs pollution control. It highlights the retention pathways and performance differences among various MBR configurations, and evaluates the retention mechanisms and stability of polymeric, ceramic, and composite membranes. The combined effects of membrane pore size, MPs characteristics, and operational parameters are also discussed. Moreover, the enrichment behavior of MPs in sludge, membrane fouling mechanisms, and their impacts on biological treatment performance are critically analyzed. The potential of advanced and hybrid MBR systems, enhanced via bioaugmentation, adsorption media, and oxidative coupling technologies, for deep MPs removal is further assessed. Based on peer-reviewed studies from 2016 to 2025, this review provides an up-to-date, integrated assessment of MBR performance, modeling approaches, process-intensification strategies, sludge management, and policy considerations to support the scale-up and engineering deployment of MBR technologies for MPs remediation.
