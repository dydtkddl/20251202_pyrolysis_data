You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Membrane bioreactor strategies for enhanced microplastic removal in wastewater: A review Microplastics (MPs), as emerging contaminants, are widely detected in municipal wastewater due to their potential toxicity and bioaccumulation, raising increasing environmental concerns. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs), through the synergistic effects of membrane filtration and biological degradation, have demonstrated significant advantages in MPs removal. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the application of MBRs for MPs pollution control. It highlights the retention pathways and performance differences among various MBR configurations, and evaluates the retention mechanisms and stability of polymeric, ceramic, and composite membranes. The combined effects of membrane pore size, MPs characteristics, and operational parameters are also discussed. Moreover, the enrichment behavior of MPs in sludge, membrane fouling mechanisms, and their impacts on biological treatment performance are critically analyzed. The potential of advanced and hybrid MBR systems, enhanced via bioaugmentation, adsorption media, and oxidative coupling technologies, for deep MPs removal is further assessed. Based on peer-reviewed studies from 2016 to 2025, this review provides an up-to-date, integrated assessment of MBR performance, modeling approaches, process-intensification strategies, sludge management, and policy considerations to support the scale-up and engineering deployment of MBR technologies for MPs remediation.
