You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The fast co-pyrolysis study of PVC and biomass for disposing of solid wastes and resource utilization in N2 and CO2 This study investigated the fast pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and wood powder (WP). Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) was used to study their pyrolysis characteristics in N2 and CO2, and the interaction of them were studied in a fixed bed reactor. The results showed that the addition of WP advanced the two stages of the pyrolysis of PVC and increased the maximum weight loss temperature, the pyrolysis modes of PVC and WP were same in N2 and CO2. Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased after WP was added, while the aromatic hydrocarbons with more than six carbons decreased. And the more WP was added, the more obvious the inhibitory effect. Compared with pyrolysis in N2, CO2 improve further the pyrolysis efficiency of waste and effectively inhibited the generation of harmful substances such as PAHs. The content of CO and CO2 increased and the content of CH4 and H2 decreased when WP was added. According to the experimental results, the mechanism of formation of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was deduced. These studies provided a theoretical basis for the co-pyrolysis of PVC and biomass to obtain low carbon hydrocarbons.
