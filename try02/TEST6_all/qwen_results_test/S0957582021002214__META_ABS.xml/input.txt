The fast co-pyrolysis study of PVC and biomass for disposing of solid wastes and resource utilization in N2 and CO2 This study investigated the fast pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and wood powder (WP). Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) was used to study their pyrolysis characteristics in N2 and CO2, and the interaction of them were studied in a fixed bed reactor. The results showed that the addition of WP advanced the two stages of the pyrolysis of PVC and increased the maximum weight loss temperature, the pyrolysis modes of PVC and WP were same in N2 and CO2. Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased after WP was added, while the aromatic hydrocarbons with more than six carbons decreased. And the more WP was added, the more obvious the inhibitory effect. Compared with pyrolysis in N2, CO2 improve further the pyrolysis efficiency of waste and effectively inhibited the generation of harmful substances such as PAHs. The content of CO and CO2 increased and the content of CH4 and H2 decreased when WP was added. According to the experimental results, the mechanism of formation of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was deduced. These studies provided a theoretical basis for the co-pyrolysis of PVC and biomass to obtain low carbon hydrocarbons.
