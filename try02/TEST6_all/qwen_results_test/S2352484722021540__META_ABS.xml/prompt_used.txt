You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Automobile fuels (diesel and petrol) from plastic pyrolysis oil—Production and characterisation Plastics like high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), and Polypropylene (PP) constitute a large portion of municipal solid waste. Plastics can be pyrolysed for reuse, but the end-product qualities are critical to industry refining processes. Pilot-scale pyrolysis and vacuum distillation were used to thermally degrade the plastics and convert it to petrol (gasoline) and diesel. Batch pyrolysis of HDPE, PS, and PP at 540 oC yielded plastic pyrolysis crude oils. The crude oil was separated into different fractions starting with distillation temperatures of less than 170 OC, 170 to 380 °C, and above 380 °C. The quality of the produced crude oil, gasoline, and diesel cuts was evaluated analytically according to the fuel specifications. This study demonstrated that pyrolysis of plastics can convert up to 80% of solids by weight) into liquid crude oil. HDPE pyrolysis produces lower quantities of oil due to the production of wax. A high calorific value (38.1 to 42.9 MJ/kg) similar to fossil fuels indicates that the liquid product of plastic pyrolysis could be a viable energy source. Plastic pyrolysis crude oil from PS mostly yielded gasoline at around 70% by weight, while HDPE and PP yield predominantly diesel at more than 50% by weight. The distilled oil characterisation results were outstanding, confirming that the quality of produced petrol and diesel from plastics pyrolysis oil suppress minimum specifications for automotive fuel standards. The cetane index of HDPE and PP diesel was found to be 60 and 55 respectively, significantly above the required value of 46 for automotive diesel. Higher heating values of most petrol cuts were in the range of 41.1 to 44.6 MJ/kg. These and other fuel qualities are within or near the approved range for automotive fuel. Thus, the findings can be used to build a foundation for the industrial manufacture of automotive quality fuels from plastic solid waste.
