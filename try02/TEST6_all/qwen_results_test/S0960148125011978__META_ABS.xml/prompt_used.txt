You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Innovative recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic panels with the aim of polymer degradation and valuable chemical production Recycling end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) panels is challenging, as multiple-layer structure makes separation and material recovery processes complex and resource-intensive. This study embarks on an innovative chemical recycling technique based on the liquefaction of organic fractions of PV panels in an oxidative environment. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of virgin PV waste showed the mass loss in three stages, with residual mass left in the range of 32–40 %. During oxidative liquefaction following a well-constructed experimental (Central Composition and Fractional Factorial) design effects of three different parameters, including temperature ranging from 200 to 300 °C, hydrogen peroxide serving as an oxidant (30–60 % overall volume of liquid), and the waste-to-liquid ratio of 12.5–37.5 %, were studied. Total polymer degradation (TPD) was calculated in the range of 20–100 %. The liquid fraction obtained after the process was analyzed through gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID), to quantify the yield of oxygenated chemical compounds (OCCs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis identified various structural modifications and the degradation of polymeric components. An inverse analysis of the process heating behavior was performed to identify the temperature span over which degradation of polymers occurs and specify the nature of the reaction (exothermic or endothermic). An analysis of variance ANOVA was performed to identify the optimal values of parameters supporting maximum TPD and OCCs yield against the minimum energy consumption, a meaningful input for a potential scale-up of the PV panel recycling technique.
