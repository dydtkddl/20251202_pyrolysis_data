Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of microwave torrefied biomass with waste plastics using ZSM-5 as a catalyst for high quality bio-oil This study aims to produce high quality bio-oil by microwave co-pyrolysis of torrefied biomass (rice straw) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) using ZSM-5 as a catalyst. A central composite experimental design was used to optimize the reaction condition by response surface methodology analysis. The effects of reaction temperatures and catalyst dosages on the product yield and chemical selectivity of bio-oil were investigated. Results suggested that bio-oil obtained from torrefied biomass contained a lower water content compared with the control.The major chemical compounds of bio-oil were hydrocarbons, ketones, phenols, esters and alcohols (∼80%).Bio-oils with high hydrocarbon content (∼40% in the bio-oil) were obtained in the development of this experiment. Quadratic models were used to predict the bio-oil yield and chemical selectivity of the bio-oil obtained during the reactions.
