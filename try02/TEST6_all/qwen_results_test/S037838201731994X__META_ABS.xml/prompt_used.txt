You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave assisted co-pyrolysis of biomasses with polypropylene and polystyrene for high quality bio-oil production In this study, co-pyrolysis of five lignocellulosic biomass residues, viz. groundnut shell (G), bagasse (B), rice husk (RH), Prosopis juliflora (PJF) and mixed wood sawdust (MWSD), with two synthetic plastics, polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), was conducted to improve the quality of bio-oil. Equal composition of biomass and plastic was pyrolyzed at 450 W microwave power using graphite susceptor, and the yields of bio-oil, char and gas fractions were determined. The bio-oil yields from PS-biomass blends varied in the range of 51–60 wt%, with maximum yield obtained from PS-MWSD, while that from PP-biomass blends were 25–41 wt% with maximum yield obtained from PP-RH. The higher heating value of co-pyrolysis bio-oil was high (38–42 MJ kg−1) as compared to bio-oil obtained from only biomass pyrolysis (20–30 MJ kg−1). Energy yield of co-pyrolysis bio-oil was significantly higher with PS mixtures (73–81%) than PP mixtures (32–62%). Importantly, the bio-oil, char and gas yields, and organic composition of bio-oil were non-additive with respect to that obtained from pyrolysis of the individual feedstocks. The presence of PS boosted the production of aromatic hydrocarbons (48–54 wt%), while PP promoted aliphatic hydrocarbons (19–33 wt%) in co-pyrolysis bio-oil. Specifically, high selectivity towards alkanes in bio-oil was obtained from PP-RH mixture. Co-pyrolysis bio-oil contained less moisture with lower acidity compared to pyrolysis bio-oil. RH-PS and RH-PP mixtures were shown to be the better biomass-plastic combinations from the viewpoint of recovering high energy in bio-oil. The microwave co-pyrolysis process efficiency was also high (63–68%) and promising.
