You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One step synthesis of cerium-based porous carbon microsphere by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and its adsorption of rhodamine B Cerium-based porous carbon microsphere (Ce/PCM) was synthesized by one step ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP), and the structure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Raman spectrometer. Furthermore, the adsorption performance of Ce/PCM was tested by Rhodamine B. (Rh B). The characteristic’s results showed the structure and specific surface area of Ce/PCM were affected by the pyrolysis temperature, and 800-Ce/PCM had the maximum specific surface area as 472.9 m2·g−1. The adsorption evaluation showed that 800-Ce/PCM had the best removal efficiency, and the maximum adsorption capacity was as high as 508.2 mg·g−1. The results suggested the adsorption kinetics of Ce/PCM for Rh B follows pseudo second-order dynamics and Freundlich model, which indicated that the adsorption process includes chemical adsorption and multilayer adsorption. Kinetic thermodynamic studies proved the absorption was endothermic reaction. The analysis of absorption mechanism indicated that the removal mechanism mainly includes pore filling, hydrogen bonding and surface adsorption.
