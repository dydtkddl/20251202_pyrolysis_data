You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of zinc-based active sites on porous carbon and electrochemical properties in lithium-sulfur batteries Hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) is considered as one of the promising cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) owing to its appealing merits. However, it is still preventing the shuttle effect poorly due to the weak interaction between nonpolar carbon and polar polysulfide (LiPS). Herein, we report a facile method to prepare polar hierarchically porous carbon by in-situ loading the different amounts of zinc-based active sites (p-HPC-X) onto the HPC materials. The close combination of a carbon interconnected skeleton and ZnS nanoparticles derived zinc-based active sites forms the strong interaction that suppresses the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect and catalyzes the kinetics redox reactions of lithium polysulfide/sulfide. Moreover, the effect of polar sites introduced in situ on the morphology/porosity of carbon materials is also focused on. Crystallization of zinc-based active sites during the freeze-drying process and self-assembly during carbonization allow the pore size distribution of porous carbon to be customized, which offers fast lithium-ion and electron transport channels. Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical pore structure and suitable polarity sites, the p-HPC-X exhibits high capacity and good cycling performance. Especially p-HPC-1, it yields a high reversible capacity of 683.7 mAh g−1 and a low fading rate of 0.041% per cycle over 900 cycles at a current density of 1 C. This work offers novel insights into realizing the effect of in-situ loaded active sites on pore structure and electrochemical performance in LSBs.
