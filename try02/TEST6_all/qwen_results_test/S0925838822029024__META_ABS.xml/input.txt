Synthesis chemical methods for deposition of ZnO, CdO and CdZnO thin films to facilitate further research Thin film materials have been used in semiconductor devices, wireless communications, telecommunications, integrated circuits, rectifiers, transistors, solar cells, lightemitting diodes, photoconductors and light crystal displays, lithography, micro- electromechanical systems (MEMS) and multifunctional emerging coatings, as well as other emerging cutting technologies. The ZnO, CdO and CdZnO thin films were deposited by chemical routes such as chemical bath deposition, spray pyrolysis, Sol-Gel spin coating, electrodeposition, SILAR, chemical vapour deposition, atomic layer deposition, and pulsed vapour deposition are discussed. Furthermore, the ZnO, CdO and CdZnO thin films depend on various preparative parameters such as the molarity, pH of the solution, deposition time, annealing temperature, annealing time, thickness, substrate used and pressure etc are also discussed.
