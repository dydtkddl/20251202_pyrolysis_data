Desulfurization reactions of thiophene and cyclohexane over Zn and Nb modified zeolites in FCC process In refineries, one of the most important production units is Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC). In them, the incorporation of additives to the catalyst is a very interesting option to reduce the sulfur content of gasoline, and thus obtain commercial fuel specifications. In this study, the transformation of thiophene into a cyclohexane (HC) stream for its in-situ desulfurization has been investigated, using catalysts based on niobium or zinc (6 wt%) incorporated into three types of zeolites: HUSY, HBeta and HZSM-5. Catalytic tests were carried out at 773 K in an automatically controlled fixed-bed tubular reactor. The reaction products were analyzed online by gas chromatography, with FID detector for hydrocarbons and SCD for sulfur compounds, and the catalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, N2 adsorption isotherms, HRTEM, XRF, 29Si and 27Al solid state NMR, NH3-TPD and FTIR-pyridine techniques. The results indicate that the addition of metals did not significantly alter the textural and structural properties of the zeolites, and that the Nb/HB and Nb/HY catalysts were the most effective in the conversion of thiophene, and selective toward paraffins and H2S mainly. The performance of these materials was attributed to the existence of an optimal balance between the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which increased the hydrogen transfer coefficient (HTC) during the cyclohexane transformation, resulting in higher desulfurization activity. The addition of zinc drastically increased the density of the Lewis acid sites and decreased the HTC, favoring the production of aromatics and thiophene condensation reactions, thus transferring sulfur to the gasoline streams. In general, the catalysts investigated are of significant interest as additives for sulfur reduction in FCC gasoline streams, either by producing easily removable H2S or by transferring sulfur to heavier fractions.
