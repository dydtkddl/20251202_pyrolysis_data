You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An overview of processes and considerations in the modelling of fixed-bed biomass combustion Biomass fuel is an environmentally friendly renewable energy source and carbon-neutral (non-fossil) fuel alternative. To facilitate its wider uptake, significant efforts are undertaken to model and experimentally study biomass combustion processes, in both industrial-scale (grate fired) and small-scale (lab-scale) combustors. In many studies, the core aim is to better understand the relationship between thermal conversion processes (drying, pyrolysis, char conversion) and their interrelationship to combustor performance (efficiency, emissions, process temperatures, scale formation, and instabilities). However, due to the complexity of solid fuel (particle) conversion and fuel bed behaviour, precise modelling of all aspects of biomass fixed-bed combustion is not readily achievable. Despite the existence of excellent experimental and modelling studies on numerous aspects related to the characteristics of forestry derived biomass fuels and their combustion, research in this field is challenging. Complications arise from the multitude of fuels used, the varying geometries and combustor configurations investigated and the different modelling methodologies adopted to resolve steady-state and transient operation. The literature includes works on various aspects of biomass combustion, including that undertaken in fixed-beds. However, whilst these works are valuable, they do not sufficiently cover the methods and fundamentals to model direct thermal conversion, at the bed and particle-level. The aims of the present study are to provide a fundamental overview of the methodologies employed in the modelling of laboratory-scale fixed-bed combustors. The paper also includes treatment of the fundamental thermo-physical fuel characteristics which need to be considered when undertaking macro-scale (bed-level) modelling. The paper concludes with summary observations in relation to the modelling of fixed-bed combustion as well as some opportunities which warrant further research and the challenges to be overcome.
