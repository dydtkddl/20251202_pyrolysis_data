You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regeneration of coked catalysts via ozonation: Experimental study of diffusion–reaction mechanisms at pellet and reactor scales This work focuses on regeneration of coked catalysts using ozonation as an alternative process to typical coke combustion with oxygen. Different samples of coked ZSM-5 zeolites obtained during catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene at 450 °C were exposed to an ozone enriched stream in a fixed-bed reactor. The influence of main operating parameters (time of exposure, temperature, O3 inlet concentration and gas volumetric flowrate) were studied by evaluating coke removal efficiency and by observing regeneration behavior both at pellet and reactor scales. These experimental results led to a better insight of the diffusion–reaction phenomena occurring during the process. Diffusion limitations were illustrated thanks to an innovative method, the analytical acquisition of carbon radial profiles on catalyst pellets, while the apprehension and quantification of competing reactivity (thermal, catalytic and oxidation) gave a better understanding of the ozonation process. Time of exposure and temperature were found to significantly affect carbon removal efficiency, while inlet ozone concentration and flowrate influence were respectively moderate and null in the investigated range. Similarly to combustion, coke ozonation is driven by a balance between diffusion and reactivity, leading to the appearance of a mix of known regeneration regimes depending on the operating conditions: homogeneous and shrinking-core.
