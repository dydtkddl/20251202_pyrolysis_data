Boosting medium- and high-temperature NH3-SCR performance over FeMOR with distorted tetra-coordinated framework Al species The coordination environment of aluminum species plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite-based ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) catalysts. Herein, we present a novel strategy to boost medium- and high-temperature NH3-SCR activity through the employment of a FeMOR zeolite enriched with distorted tetra-coordinated framework Al species (denoted as Al(IV)-2). The obtained FeMOR-K demonstrates outstanding high-temperature deNOx performance, achieving a wide temperature window of 315–650 °C with a 90% NOx conversion. Systematical characterization reveals that the interaction between Fe species and tetra-coordinated framework Al species (denoted as Al(IV)-1) leads to transformation of Al(IV)-1 into Al(IV)-2. The resulting Al(IV)-2 species enhance the dispersion and stability of iron through the Fe-O-Al bridging structures and provide additional acidic sites for NH3 adsorption, thereby facilitating the NH3-SCR reaction at medium- and high temperatures. Kinetic analysis indicates that FeMOR-K has a lower activation energy compared to its counterpart with less Al(IV)-2 species. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations unveil that the synergistic anchoring interaction between Al and Fe species governs the formation of Al(IV)-2 species and determines the final state of Fe species in the catalyst. This comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the distorted tetra-coordinated framework Al species and metal active sites provides new insights for developing superior medium- and high-temperature NH3-SCR catalysts.
