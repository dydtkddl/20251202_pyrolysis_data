You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Boosting medium- and high-temperature NH3-SCR performance over FeMOR with distorted tetra-coordinated framework Al species The coordination environment of aluminum species plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite-based ammonia selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) catalysts. Herein, we present a novel strategy to boost medium- and high-temperature NH3-SCR activity through the employment of a FeMOR zeolite enriched with distorted tetra-coordinated framework Al species (denoted as Al(IV)-2). The obtained FeMOR-K demonstrates outstanding high-temperature deNOx performance, achieving a wide temperature window of 315–650 °C with a 90% NOx conversion. Systematical characterization reveals that the interaction between Fe species and tetra-coordinated framework Al species (denoted as Al(IV)-1) leads to transformation of Al(IV)-1 into Al(IV)-2. The resulting Al(IV)-2 species enhance the dispersion and stability of iron through the Fe-O-Al bridging structures and provide additional acidic sites for NH3 adsorption, thereby facilitating the NH3-SCR reaction at medium- and high temperatures. Kinetic analysis indicates that FeMOR-K has a lower activation energy compared to its counterpart with less Al(IV)-2 species. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations unveil that the synergistic anchoring interaction between Al and Fe species governs the formation of Al(IV)-2 species and determines the final state of Fe species in the catalyst. This comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the distorted tetra-coordinated framework Al species and metal active sites provides new insights for developing superior medium- and high-temperature NH3-SCR catalysts.
