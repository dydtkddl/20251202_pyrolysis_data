You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A bottom-up approach to prepare cobalt-based bimetallic supported catalysts for hydrolysis of ammonia borane Catalysis is an important research topic in the field of hydrogen generation by hydrolysis of boron-based hydrides. A typical example is hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3), 1 mol of which is able to liberate up to 3 mol H2 at temperatures lower than 80 °C. However, the presence of a catalyst, generally metal-based, is necessary. The present work was thus conducted in this framework. Herein, we propose a bottom-up approach to prepare cobalt-based bimetallic supported catalysts. The general idea was: first, to screen cobalt-based bimetallic nanoparticles and select the best combination, which was found to be CoCu with a weight ratio 70:30 – its reactivity was discussed in terms of electronic and geometric effects; second, to prepare Ni foam-supported CoCu through a 2-stage process – CoCu/Ni showed a hydrogen generation rate of ca. 25 mL min−1, which almost 5 times better than that observed for the monometallic counterparts Co/Ni and Cu/Ni; third, to propose a new concept of CoCu supported catalysts using a plastic film (light, easy to handle and to prepare) – it showed to be stable and, despite a low hydrogen generation rate (because most of the nanoparticles were embedded in the film), totally converted AB. Our main results are reported and discussed herein.
