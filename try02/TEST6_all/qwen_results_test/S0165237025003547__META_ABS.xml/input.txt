A review on current technologies for plastic waste treatment with focus on pyrolysis for energy recovery Plastic waste pollution is a growing global concern as the rate of plastic production continues to rise, far exceeding current recycling capabilities. A significant portion of this waste is discarded into the environment, where it poses serious threats to ecosystems and human health due to its non-biodegradable nature. With traditional recycling proving to be insufficient and economically challenging, there is an urgent need to explore more sustainable and efficient methods for plastic waste disposal. This article presents a critical review of various plastic waste management strategies, focusing particularly on pyrolysis, an emerging thermochemical technique that offers promising results. Pyrolysis involves the thermal degradation of plastic waste in the absence of oxygen, converting it into high-calorific-value products such as pyrolysis oil, syngas, and char. These products can be reused as alternative fuels or chemical feedstocks, supporting both energy recovery and resource circularity. Compared to conventional disposal methods like landfilling and incineration, pyrolysis generates fewer toxic emissions and offers higher material recovery efficiency. As plastic consumption and waste generation are expected to increase, pyrolysis provides a viable, scalable, and environmentally friendly alternative for waste reduction. This review emphasizes the role of pyrolysis as a key technology for plastic depolymerization, highlighting its advantages, limitations, and future potential in the context of sustainable waste management. The adoption of pyrolysis, supported by regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and public awareness, could significantly reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste while contributing to the development of a circular economy and sustainable energy systems.
