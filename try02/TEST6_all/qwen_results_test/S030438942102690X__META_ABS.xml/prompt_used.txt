You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sensing and annihilation of ultra-trace level arsenic (III) using fluoranthene decorated fluorescent nanofibrous cellulose probe Besides presence of heavy metals, especially arsenic in water bodies, northern India is striving to obliterate crop residue, which is otherwise burnt to make the fields ready for subsequent crop, causing acute air pollution. Through this study, an effort has been made to utilize wheat-straw cellulose to develop inexpensive and efficacious sensing cum annihilation system for deleterious arsenite ions As(III) in water by grafting a novel fluorophore, 3-bromofluoranthene on cellulose (BF@CFs). BF@CFs were characterized for structural, morphological and thermal properties using FTIR, XRD, TGA, FESEM, EDS and TEM, which confirmed the successful insertion of fluoranthene molecule on cellulose while preserving its crystalline nanofibrous structure. Fluorescent studies indicated strong affinity of BF@CFs towards arsenite ions exhibiting “turn on” fluorescence response attributed to inhibition of photo induced electron transfer (PET) and metal ion chelation with a limit of detection of 2.8 ng L−1, lower than WHO prescribed limit of 10 μg L−1. Besides sensing, the porous fibrous network of BF@CFs exhibited good adsorption of As(III) ions with maximum adsorption of 171.2 μg g−1 at 35 min under optimized conditions. BF@CFs displayed 95.2% removal efficiency with 2 μg L−1 concentration of As (III) ions at room temperature and neutral pH observed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer coupled with hydride generation assembly (HG-AAS) measurements. BF@CFs retained adsorption 97.3% efficiency after five adsorption/ desorption cycles displaying excellent reusability and stability, strengthening its potential as dual functional sensor and adsorbent.
