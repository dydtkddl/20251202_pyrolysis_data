Efficient application of newly synthesized green Bi2O3 nanoparticles for sustainable biodiesel production via membrane reactor Introduction of waste and non-edible oil seeds coupled with green nanotechnology offered a pushover to sustainable and economical biofuels and bio refinery production globally. The current study encompasses the synthesis and application of novel green, highly reactive and recyclable bismuth oxide nanocatalyst derived from Euphorbia royealeana (Falc.) Boiss. leaves extract via biological method for sustainable biofuel synthesis from highly potent Cannabis sativa seed oil (34% w/w) via membrane reactors. Advanced techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Diffraction X-Ray (EDX), and FT-IR were employed to illustrate the newly synthesized green bismuth oxide nanoparticles. 92% of FAMEs were produced under optimal reaction conditions such as a 1.5% w/w catalyst weight, 1:12 oil to methanol molar ratio, and a reaction temperature of 92 ⸰C for 3.5 h via membrane reactor. The synthesized Cannabis biodiesel was identified using the FT-IR and GC-MS techniques. The fuel properties of synthesized biofuels (acid number 0.203 mg KOH/g, density 0.8623 kg/L, kinematic viscosity 5.32 cSt, flash point 80 °C, pour point −11 °C, cloud point −11 °C, and Sulfur 0.00047 wt %, and carbon residues 0.2) were studied and established to be comparable with internationally set parameters. The experimental data (R2 = 0.997) shows that this reaction follow pseudo first-order kinetics. These findings affirm the application of green bismuth oxide nanoparticles as economical, highly reactive and eco-friendly candidate for industrial scale biodiesel production from non-edible oil seeds.
