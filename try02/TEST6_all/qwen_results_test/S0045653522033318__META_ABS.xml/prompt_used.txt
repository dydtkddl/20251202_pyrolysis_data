You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient application of newly synthesized green Bi2O3 nanoparticles for sustainable biodiesel production via membrane reactor Introduction of waste and non-edible oil seeds coupled with green nanotechnology offered a pushover to sustainable and economical biofuels and bio refinery production globally. The current study encompasses the synthesis and application of novel green, highly reactive and recyclable bismuth oxide nanocatalyst derived from Euphorbia royealeana (Falc.) Boiss. leaves extract via biological method for sustainable biofuel synthesis from highly potent Cannabis sativa seed oil (34% w/w) via membrane reactors. Advanced techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Diffraction X-Ray (EDX), and FT-IR were employed to illustrate the newly synthesized green bismuth oxide nanoparticles. 92% of FAMEs were produced under optimal reaction conditions such as a 1.5% w/w catalyst weight, 1:12 oil to methanol molar ratio, and a reaction temperature of 92 ⸰C for 3.5 h via membrane reactor. The synthesized Cannabis biodiesel was identified using the FT-IR and GC-MS techniques. The fuel properties of synthesized biofuels (acid number 0.203 mg KOH/g, density 0.8623 kg/L, kinematic viscosity 5.32 cSt, flash point 80 °C, pour point −11 °C, cloud point −11 °C, and Sulfur 0.00047 wt %, and carbon residues 0.2) were studied and established to be comparable with internationally set parameters. The experimental data (R2 = 0.997) shows that this reaction follow pseudo first-order kinetics. These findings affirm the application of green bismuth oxide nanoparticles as economical, highly reactive and eco-friendly candidate for industrial scale biodiesel production from non-edible oil seeds.
