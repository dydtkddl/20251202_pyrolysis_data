You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structural functionalized TiO2-mediated photocatalysts as dye degradation agents: A systematic review Water contaminated with dyes severely impacts human health and the aquatic ecosystem, thus becoming a global problem. Photocatalysis is considered the most promising method for dye remediation and degradation. In this context, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is considered an ideal photocatalyst due to its nontoxicity, biodegradability, abundance, recyclability, and improved properties. However, the application of TiO2 for the removal of organic pollutants faces numerous challenges, including its wide band-gap, low affinity, mass transfer limits, particle aggregation, and regeneration issues. Due to its superior physical and chemical properties compared to pure TiO2, considerable efforts have been made to modify TiO2 with various materials. Structural modifications can be achieved in various ways, particularly through the introduction of dopants and the use of support materials. These factors are important for increasing the number of active sites and slowing the recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This review presents photo-assisted dye degradation and recent advances in supported and doped TiO2 photocatalysts. Furthermore, the role of dopants and support materials and their contribution to improving the photocatalytic potential of TiO2 were reported. The structural properties of TiO2 and possible mechanisms of TiO2-mediated dye degradation, as well as its future potential, are also discussed.
