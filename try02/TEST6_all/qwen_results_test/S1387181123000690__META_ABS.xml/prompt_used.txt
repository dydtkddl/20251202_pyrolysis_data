You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Core-shell SAPO-34@ZSM-5 composite via in situ solid-solid transformation of pre-coating MCM-41 shell and its application in methanol-to-olefins Hierarchically core-shell-structured SAPO-34@ZSM-5 composite zeolite was successfully achieved by an in situ solid-solid transformation of a pre-coating MCM-41 shell layer with the help of ZSM-5 seeds under a traditional hydrothermal crystallization route. As a result, a uniform nano-sized polycrystalline ZSM-5 shell closely grows on the core SAPO-34 microsphere, thus forming a desirable core-shell structured zeolite composite. Besides, the SAPO-34 core and the polycrystalline ZSM-5 shell are intimately connected through mesosilica substrates as a “bridge” which guarantees the integrity of the core-shell structure very well, even under harsh ultrasonic treatment at a high frequency. More crucially, this innovative method effectively overcomes the chemical and structural incompatibility between the core crystals and the shell zeolite during synthesis, and simultaneously avoids the collapse and dissolution of SAPO-34 crystals mainly derived from the shielding effect of MCM-41 shell layer under a highly alkaline gel precursor yielding ZSM-5. Furthermore, the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) was selected as a probe reaction so as to investigate the catalytic performance of the core-shell SAPO-34@ZSM-5. It is found that besides obtaining high light olefins yield (12.3% more than that on the reference catalyst), the catalytic lifetime over core-shell SAPO-34@ZSM-5 catalyst is greatly improved, about 3 times as long as that over the pristine SAPO-34 and 2.6 times as long as that on the corresponding physically-blended SAPO-34+ZSM-5. The superior catalytic performances on the core-shell SAPO-34@ZSM-5 can be attributed to the synergetic effects between SAPO-34 (core) and ZSM-5 (shell) including different framework structures, moderate acidic properties, and well-defined hierarchical architectures.
