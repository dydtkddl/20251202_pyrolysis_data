You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Laser powder bed fusion of oxide dispersion-strengthened IN718 alloys: A complementary study on microstructure and mechanical properties In this study, two new grades of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Inconel 718 (IN718) alloys were designed by the thermochemical CALPHAD method and produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique. Alloys designated as IN718-YF and IN718-YFH, that consist Y2O3–FeO and Y2O3–FeO–Hf, respectively, were fabricated with >99.9 % densification using optimized process parameters. CALPHAD calculations were highly consistent with experimental findings, highlighting the formation of Al-containing Y–Ti–O and Y–Hf–O nano-oxides in both alloy types. Texture analyzes revealed no significant texture development in as-built (AB) or heat-treated (HT) alloys. Heat treatment was applied at 1050 °C for 1 h to enhance nano-oxide density. The nano-oxide number density remained similar in IN718-YF while it decreased in IN718-YFH alloy as a result of carbide formation after the heat treatment. Besides, formation of secondary γ′ particles was observed in the IN718-YFH/HT alloy. Even though the yield strengths of IN718-YF and IN718-YFH alloys in both AB and HT conditions were similar, the ductility of IN718-YFH was ∼50 % less in almost all conditions compared to the ductility of IN718-YF. This has been shown to be as a result of irregular shaped micron-sized Y-Hf-O oxides, martensite formation in AB condition, increased amount of carbides and existence of secondary γ′ particles in HT condition in IN718-YFH. High density of stacking faults (SF) forming at the interface of the nano-oxides have been detected in IN718-YF alloys. Besides dislocation/nanoparticle interactions, SFs which are responsible for the delocalization of the deformation improve the ductility of IN718-YF alloys. Overall, high temperature mechanical tests exhibit that both alloys have higher strength with improved ductility compared to the standard IN718 alloys, indicating the contribution of the nano-oxides.
