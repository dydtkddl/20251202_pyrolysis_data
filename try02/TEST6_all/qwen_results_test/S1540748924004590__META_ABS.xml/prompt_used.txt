You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cellulose pyrolysis kinetic model: Detailed description of volatile species Lignocellulosic biomass is typically composed by a major fraction of cellulose. Its decomposition influences on large extent the biomass rate of pyrolysis and product distribution, affecting process behaviour in thermochemical conversion processes. Containing approximately 90 % of volatile matter, volatile products from cellulose pyrolysis are very important in the characteristics of flames and ignition properties. Recent developments in analytical methods allowed a detailed identification of these volatile products, giving valuable information to process development and better understanding of kinetics. Predictions of a previous kinetic model are compared with these new findings, revealing large space for improvements. In this work, we propose a multi-step kinetic model of cellulose pyrolysis, incorporating the most recent experimental findings into the detailed product description. The model consists of four main reactions for the decomposition of cellulose, with formation of gases, volatiles, char and metaplastic species. The release of metaplastic species is described by a set of six reactions. The formation and release of 13 oxygenated hydrocarbons is predicted by the model, including anhydrosugars, furans, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones and carboxylic acids. The model also describes the formation of levoglucosan in metaplastic state before its release, explaining high heating rate mass loss behaviour. The model is compared with a large variety of experiments from literature, and validated for mass loss rates and product distribution, achieving overall good agreement despite experimental uncertainties and the large simplifications characteristic of the model formulation. Besides effectively quantifying the yields of gaseous, condensable and solid products, the model accurately captures the distribution of volatiles in terms of functional groups and C-chain length.
