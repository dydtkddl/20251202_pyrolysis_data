IR laser-induced co-decomposition of trisilane and thiirane for deposition of polycarbosilthiane films TEA CO2 laser irradiation of gaseous trisilane–thiirane mixtures results in the co-decomposition of both components and allows chemical vapor deposition of polycarbosilthiane films that undergo reaction with air moisture, evolve H2S and develop to polycarbosiloxanes. Laser-induced fluorescence experiments allowed detection of transient SiS in the gas phase. The gas-phase formation of SiS and polycarbosilthiane, accounted for on the basis GC/MS analysis of final volatile products and in situ measured FTIR spectra of the deposited polymers, involves reactions between silylenes and S atoms that are respective intermediates of trisilane and thiirane decomposition.
