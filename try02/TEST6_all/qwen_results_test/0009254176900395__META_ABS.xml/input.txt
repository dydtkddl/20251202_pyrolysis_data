Pyrolysis-hydrogenation-gas chromatography of carbonaceous material from Australian sediments, part I: Some Australian coals A technique consisting of pyrolysis at 700°C in hydrogen, followed by catalytic hydrogenation and gas chromatography of the products, has been developed for studying the carbon-skeleton structure of coal or kerogen. As a result of the hydrogenation step, the only organic compounds produced were saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis-hydrogenation of coal produced light hydrocarbon gases, n-alkanes from pentane to pentadecane, benzene, toluene, xylenes and other unidentified hydrocarbons. Samples of some coals were used to show the quantitative and qualitative reproducibility of the technique and to examine the relationship between the yields of various hydrocarbons and the usual coal parameters. The results indicated that coals have an appreciable component of long unbranched carbon chains. This component is decreased, and the aromatic component is increased, with increasing coal rank, although the relationship is complicated, probably by variations in maceral composition. The total yield of hydrocarbons from a coal was found to bear a linear relationship to its hydrogen content. This relationship could be explained on the basis of stoichiometry.
