You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High quality products from microwave catalytic pyrolysis of heavy oil and polyethylene Heavy hydrocarbon residue management has always been an environmental issue; thus, it is essential to find a method for upgrading heavy oils and plastic waste to high quality products as an alternative source of chemicals and fuels. In this study, the microwave catalytic pyrolysis (MCP) of heavy oil (HO) and LDPE (as plastic source) was proposed by employing a unique design of the catalyst, SiC foam@HZSM-5. This special catalyst design provided sufficient mass and heat transfer and enhanced the available catalyst surface area during the pyrolysis process. The effect of microwave power and the HO:LDPE ratio were investigated to optimize the product yield and quality. The results showed that the hazardous and unwanted elements of HO were eliminated by adding LDPE to the feedstock. More importantly, it was observed that the secondary and side reactions were accelerated due to a positive synergistic effect ( Δ Y ), which occurred because of hydrogen donors from the LDPE degradation and the non-thermal effect of microwave heating. The HO:LDPE ratio of 1:1 with a microwave power of 800 W and 10 min heating time were the optimum conditions; the liquid yield was about 42 wt% with around 90% of aromatics (mono- and polycyclic) relative concentration. Furthermore, the proportion of BTX was about 82% of the liquid oil, while the concentration of oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds was less than 2%. Under the above conditions, the proportion of collected non-condensable gases was around 46 wt%, which comprised light olefins (C1-C6) at about 37%, and a considerable proportion of H2 as well. Additionally, adding more LDPE to the feedstock decreased solid residue by promoting the conversion of HO, which improved catalyst efficiency.
