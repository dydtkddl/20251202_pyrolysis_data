You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation of biodegradable plastics by anaerobic digestion: Morphological, micro-structural changes and microbial community dynamics The serious environmental problem caused by traditional plastics has stimulated the popularization of biodegradable plastics (BPs). However, the rigorous prerequisite for the efficient degradation of BPs has not eliminated its potential hazard to nature. In most biosystems exists the anaerobic environment, but it is still controversial whether BPs can be degraded under such condition. Therefore, this study systematically assessed the anaerobic degradation performance of ten common BPs under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Results showed that four BPs were degraded evidently under mesophilic condition with the biodegradability of 57.9%–84.6%, while during thermophilic condition, five BPs showed remarkable degradation performance with the biodegradability of 53.0% to 95.7%. According to morphological and micro-structural analysis, the biodegradation of the BPs probably proceeded via bulk and/or surface erosion. Under mesophilic condition, Anaerolineales, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales, SBR1031, and Synergistales appeared to play an important role. During thermophilic condition, the hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis of most BPs were mainly conducted by Coprothermobacter and the archaea Methanothermobacter. This work not only provides crucial data on the anaerobic biodigestibility of BPs but also enriches the understanding of the BPs degradation mechanisms, which are of great importance for future popularization of BP products and simultaneously relieving the environmental pollution.
