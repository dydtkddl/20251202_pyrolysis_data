Direct liquefaction of low rank lignite with peach seed kernel and waste polypropylene for alternative fuel production In this study, alternative fuel potentials to petroleum were investigated by direct liquefaction of peach seed kernel (PSK), Muğla-Yatağan lignite (MYL) and waste polypropylene (wPP) separately and together. The effects of PSK and wPP on the yield and selectivity of oil products obtained by direct liquefaction of MYL were also examined. Direct liquefaction experiments were performed in a batch reactor at 1/3 solid/solvent, reaction temperature of 400 °C and reaction time of 60 min. The highest total conversion and oil + gas yield were 95% and 85% direct liquefaction of wPP, respectively. According to the calorific value analysis of the chars, the highest gross calorific value of chars was 7709 cal/g in the liquefaction of PSK, and the lowest net calorific value was 2783 cal/g in the liquefaction of MYL. PSK and wPP increased oil yield of MLY from 28% to 60% and 68%, respectively. According to the GC-MS analysis of oils (light liquid products), alternative fuels to gasoline can be produced by direct liquefaction of PSK, wPP and wPP/MYL. Alternative fuels to diesel can be produced by direct liquefaction of MYL and PSK/MYL. The co-liquefaction of MYL with wPP and PSK improved the yield and product components of the oils. The oil + gas yield of MYL was approximately increased PSK by 12% and wPP by 6%.
