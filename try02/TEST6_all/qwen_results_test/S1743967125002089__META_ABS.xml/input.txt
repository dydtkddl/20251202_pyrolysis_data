Multi-algorithm synergy in biomass pyrolysis via TG-FTIR-GC/MS: kinetic triplet resolution with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the specific product evolution This study presents a comprehensive kinetic analysis of biomass thermal decomposition by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with TG-FTIR-GC/MS hyphenated techniques. Systematic pyrolysis of wheat straw (WS) and pine sawdust (PS) under varied heating rates revealed feedstock-specific decomposition mechanisms. Model-free kinetic analysis demonstrated distinct activation energies (PS: 158.2 kJ/mol; WS: 147.3 kJ/mol), reflecting lignocellulosic divergence. Crucially, a PSO-optimized parallel reaction model resolved kinetic triplets with exceptional accuracy (R 2 > 0.99), identifying cellulose-dominated degradation in PS versus hemicellulose-driven decomposition in WS. Volatile evolution analysis decoupled temperature-dependent product profiles: PS generated aromatic compounds at high temperatures, while WS favoured furans and phenolics. By integrating multi-scale pyrolysis kinetics and volatile chemistry, this work establishes a novel framework for targeted biomass valorization via algorithmic optimization and multi-technique synergy.
