You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of lignin with polystyrene into high-value aromatics through co-pyrolysis and post-plasma refining Lignin was co-pyrolyzed with polystyrene to subject volatiles to post-plasma refining for potential aromatic production, mainly focusing on effects of blend ratio and plasma parameters. Firstly, the co-pyrolysis at equal mass ratio was beneficial for reducing residual char and reaction energy barrier. Secondly, elevating polystyrene blend ratio could improve oil yield, fuel-grade, and aromatic selectivity, but the improvement was compromised, showing volatiles synergy and plasma excitation were more favorable at a balanced ratio, because the H-donation of polystyrene and the bond-cleavage ability of lignin-derived oxyradicals were fully utilized. Thirdly, increasing plasma current enhanced plasma emission spectra, meaning more energetic reactive species, while extending discharge length had a little effect on the spectra, but doubling the discharge length had a more obvious refining effect than increasing the discharge current by equal steps. Fourthly, increased plasma parameters contributed to the breakage of bridged bonds between benzene rings and the loss of aliphatic side-chains, deepening deoxygenation, lowing molecular weight, and raising aromatic proton ratio. However, higher plasma current mainly weakened the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics, and higher discharge length severely decreased the aromatic yield. Therefore, this study suggested the possibility of using non-catalytic methods to recover high-value aromatics from lignin and polystyrene.
