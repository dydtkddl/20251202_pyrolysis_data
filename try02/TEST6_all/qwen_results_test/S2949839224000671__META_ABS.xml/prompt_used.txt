You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Revitalizing the circular economy: An exploration of e-waste recycling approaches in a technological epoch In today's world, the proliferation of electronic devices has led to a significant increase in electronic waste (e-waste) generation, necessitating the development of innovative approaches for sustainable management. E-waste recycling, which involves the recovery of valuable materials from discarded electronic devices, has emerged as a promising solution to the growing e-waste problem. This article presents an analysis of the current state of research on e-waste management, encompassing various recycling approaches, including mechanical, chemical, and biological methods. The analysis revealed that most of the research on e-waste management has focused on the development of recycling technologies, with a significant emphasis on the use of chemical methods. However, there is a growing interest in the use of biological methods, such as bioreactors and microbial technologies, for e-waste management. Many challenges including lack of uniform regulations, inadequate infrastructure, and high cost of recycling technologies were initiated. The formation of product reuse through remanufacturing, and the deployment of effective recycling facilities are necessary for the management of e-waste. The challenge is to develop innovative and cost-effective solutions to e-waste management (plastic-based e-waste and metals-based e-waste). Several technologies are currently applied to plastic-based e-waste and metals-based e-waste management. primary, secondary, and tertiary recycling of plastic-based e-waste and metallurgical approaches for metals-based e-waste are ideal methods for e-waste management. Furthermore, the techno-economic feasibility of different e-waste recycling approaches was estimated. The analysis suggests that while some recycling approaches are economically viable, there is a need for more research to optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these methods.
