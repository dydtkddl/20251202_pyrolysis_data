You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Commercialization potential of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) recycled nanomaterials: A review on validation parameters Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is a polymer which is considered as one of the major contaminants to the environment. The PET waste materials can be recycled to produce value-added products. PET can be converted to nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanocomposites, and nano coatings. To extend the applications of PET nanomaterials, understanding its commercialization potential is important. In addition, knowledge about the factors affecting recycling of PET based nanomaterials is essential. The presented review is focused on understanding the PET commercialization aspects, keeping in mind market analysis, growth drivers, regulatory affairs, safety considerations, issues associated with scale-up, manufacturing challenges, economic viability, and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the paper elaborates the challenges associated with the use of PET based nanomaterials. These challenges include PET contamination to water, soil, sediments, and human exposure to PET nanomaterials. Moreover, the paper discusses in detail about the factors affecting PET recycling, commercialization, and circular economy with specific emphasis on life cycle assessment (LCA) of PET recycled nanomaterials.
