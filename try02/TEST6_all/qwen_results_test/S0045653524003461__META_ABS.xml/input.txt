Commercialization potential of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) recycled nanomaterials: A review on validation parameters Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is a polymer which is considered as one of the major contaminants to the environment. The PET waste materials can be recycled to produce value-added products. PET can be converted to nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanocomposites, and nano coatings. To extend the applications of PET nanomaterials, understanding its commercialization potential is important. In addition, knowledge about the factors affecting recycling of PET based nanomaterials is essential. The presented review is focused on understanding the PET commercialization aspects, keeping in mind market analysis, growth drivers, regulatory affairs, safety considerations, issues associated with scale-up, manufacturing challenges, economic viability, and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the paper elaborates the challenges associated with the use of PET based nanomaterials. These challenges include PET contamination to water, soil, sediments, and human exposure to PET nanomaterials. Moreover, the paper discusses in detail about the factors affecting PET recycling, commercialization, and circular economy with specific emphasis on life cycle assessment (LCA) of PET recycled nanomaterials.
