Recent advances in syngas production from biomass catalytic gasification: A critical review on reactors, catalysts, catalytic mechanisms and mathematical models Biomass gasification converts into syngas, then into other chemicals via Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis is promising for renewable energy utilization. Although gasification is a sustainable and environmental-friendly technology for value-added utilization of biomass, tar formation is the major problem during the biomass gasification. Tar could condense on the reactor then block and foul equipment. An optimized gasifier and highly active catalyst were proved to be effective for biomass tar elimination. Furthermore, tar formation mechanism and the decomposition pathway were also important to advance the optimization of gasification reactors and catalyst design. This paper summarized the fundamentals, such as gasifier types, Ni-based catalyst, and reaction and deactivation mechanism. This review also sheds light on other excellent catalysts, effective gasifiers and mathematical models of biomass catalytic gasification, and catalyst reaction mechanisms and mathematical models are also discussed in detail. At last, the paper ends with a conclusion and prospective discussion to the latter lab and industrial-scale research.
