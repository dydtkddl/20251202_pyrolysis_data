Heteroatom-doped MNC catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions: Doping strategies and active site regulation MNC catalyst is the most potential alternative candidate for precious metal-based catalyst and has been widely concerned by researchers in recent years. As a simple and effective means, heteroatom doping is widely used to improve catalyst performance. It has been proved that heteroatom can adjust the intrinsic activity of catalyst sites by optimizing the electronic structure of MNx active sites. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the influence of heteroatom doping on catalytic activity and the modulation of active centers in MNC catalysts. The various methods of introducing heteroatoms into MNC catalysts are thoroughly examined, and common strategies for heteroatom doping are summarized. Additionally, this article addresses current challenges in the research of MNC catalysts and suggests potential future directions for their development.
