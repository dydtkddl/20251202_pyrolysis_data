You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ and ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunches using mesostructured aluminosilicate catalysts Mesostructured aluminosilicates of Al-MSU-F (commercial), Al-SBA-15 (home-made), and mesoMFI (a mesoporous aluminosilicate with MFI structure, home-made), with a silica-to-alumina ratio of 40, were used as catalyst for the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of empty fruit bunches (EFB) at 600 °C. The highest selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil was obtained over mesoMFI due to its higher acidity than Al-SBA-15 and Al-MSU-F. In addition, ex-situ CP of EFB using mesoMFI was compared with in-situ CP; the ex-situ configuration produced higher aromatic hydrocarbons than the in-situ configuration. Meanwhile, in-situ and ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of EFB (with a H/Ceff ratio less than 0.3) and polypropylene (PP) (with a high H/Ceff ratio about 2) were carried out using the mesoMFI at 600 °C to investigate the supplementary effect of PP on the deoxygenation of EFB-derived pyrolyzates for producing aromatic hydrocarbons. Ex-situ CCP of EFB/PP (with the mass ratios of 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75) resulted in a lower formation of aromatic hydrocarbons than the in-situ CCP. In addition, the thermal decomposition behavior of EFB, PP, and EFB/PP in non-catalytic and catalytic (mesoMFI) pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); use of catalyst reduced the temperature of PP thermal degradation, but did not change the maximum reactivity temperature of EFB degradation.
