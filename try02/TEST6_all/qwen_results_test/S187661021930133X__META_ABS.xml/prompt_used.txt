You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical behavior and kinetic analysis during co-pyrolysis of starch biomass model compound and lignite Co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal has been widely investigated as a promising method to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. Evaluation on thermochemical behavior and kinetics of the co-pyrolysis process is vital for forecasting reaction performance and optimizing this technology. In this study, the thermochemical behavior of a starch biomass model compound (potato starch), a lignite and their blends during pyrolysis were investigated applying a non-isothermal thermogravimetric analyzer. Furthermore, the iso-conversion method was applied to calculate the activation energy. The results of thermogravimetric experiments indicated that the co-pyrolysis characteristics of the blends cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of pyrolysis characteristics of individual components and their blending ratio. The comparison of experimental and theoretical weight loss curves of the blends revealed that a certain degree of synergistic effect happened in the intermediate stage during co-pyrolysis process, but the volatiles yields in the entire co-pyrolysis process were not obviously impacted. Kinetic analysis indicated that the activation energy values of both individual and blended samples varied with the conversion fractions during pyrolysis process. The mean activation energy values of the blends were basically the same as the estimated values calculated by weighted average.
