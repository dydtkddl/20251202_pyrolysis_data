You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Large-scale template-free synthesis of N-doped graphene nanotubes and N-doped SiO2-coated graphene nanotubes: Growth mechanism and field-emission property The use of dopants and other functional materials has been proven to be an effective approach in tailoring the electronic properties of the composition of graphene nanosheets. However, investigations into doping and compositing of tubular graphene are still at an early stage. Herein, the first large-scale synthesis of N-doped graphene nanotubes (GNTs) and the N-doped graphene coaxial nanotubes with amorphous SiO2 coating layer (GNTs@SiO2) have been performed in a facile free-template, one-step chemical vapor deposition method, and the growth mechanism was investigated in detail. This approach both simplifies the synthetic process and protects the nanotubes from destruction caused by template removal. Moreover, a high ratio of graphitic-N to pyridinic-N doping (∼6.5:1) was achieved, which is an important factor required to improve the various properties of graphene. The N-doped GNTs and GNTs@SiO2 displayed excellent field emission properties, with E to of 1.2 and 0.5 V/μm and E thr of 3.4 and 4 V/μm, respectively, and a synergistic effect mechanism has been proposed to interpret the enhanced FE properties. This present research not only offers a new route for large-scale synthesis of N-doped tubular graphene and its nanocomposite, along with excellent field emission properties and electroconductivity, but also establishes a foundation for their application in various fields.
