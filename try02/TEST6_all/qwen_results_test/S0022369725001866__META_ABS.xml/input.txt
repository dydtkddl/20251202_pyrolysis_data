Catalytic behaviour of iron-based nanomaterials for the remediation of hazardous chemicals from wastewater: A Review Recently, catalytic oxidation of emerging pollutants in wastewater with iron-based catalysts have sparked public concern. Up to now, diversity including zero-valent iron (nZVI), Fe2+/Fe3+, ZVI, iron oxides (FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeOOH), and Fe-bimetallic catalysts formed due to different phases and valances. A full consideration on the synthesis and catalytic applications of them were little concerned. Different phases of the iron oxides based magnetic nanocomposites (NCs) and nanomaterials (NMs) were studied and discussed in pollutant remediation including pharmaceutical compounds, phenolic compounds, dyes and heavy metals. Factors that influence the recovery of these materials are outlined, detailing the challenges associated with the collection of magnetic particles, and methods for improving their stability are also summarized. This review could encourage the readers to improve the synthesis approaches of iron-based catalysts with excellent catalytic activity for making the catalytic oxidation procedure and to know the degradation mechanism of hazardous organic chemicals in wastewater.
