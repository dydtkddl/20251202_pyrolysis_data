You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic behaviour of iron-based nanomaterials for the remediation of hazardous chemicals from wastewater: A Review Recently, catalytic oxidation of emerging pollutants in wastewater with iron-based catalysts have sparked public concern. Up to now, diversity including zero-valent iron (nZVI), Fe2+/Fe3+, ZVI, iron oxides (FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, FeOOH), and Fe-bimetallic catalysts formed due to different phases and valances. A full consideration on the synthesis and catalytic applications of them were little concerned. Different phases of the iron oxides based magnetic nanocomposites (NCs) and nanomaterials (NMs) were studied and discussed in pollutant remediation including pharmaceutical compounds, phenolic compounds, dyes and heavy metals. Factors that influence the recovery of these materials are outlined, detailing the challenges associated with the collection of magnetic particles, and methods for improving their stability are also summarized. This review could encourage the readers to improve the synthesis approaches of iron-based catalysts with excellent catalytic activity for making the catalytic oxidation procedure and to know the degradation mechanism of hazardous organic chemicals in wastewater.
