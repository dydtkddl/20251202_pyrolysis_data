Tamarind peel-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon: A sustainable sulfur host for enhanced lithium–sulfur battery performance Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are an attractive energy storage solution due to their high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, their practical performance often falls short of theoretical expectations. To tackle the challenges from the cathode perspective, this study investigates the use of porous carbon derived from tamarind peel biomass as a sulfur host. Tamarind peel undergoes sequential pyrolysis, activation, and nitrogen doping to yield diverse porous carbon samples. The effects of activation and nitrogen doping are thoroughly examined through spectroscopic characterizations. Li–S cells are assembled using these carbon materials and subjected to comprehensive electrochemical measurements. The results show that activated nitrogen-doped carbon/sulfur composite electrode delivers an initial capacity of 1265 mAh g−1, maintains a high coulombic efficiency of 98% over 300 cycles, and exhibits stable rate capability up to 2C. These performance enhancements are attributed to hierarchical porous structure and polar surfaces introduced by nitrogen doping, which improve sulfur utilization and reduce polysulfide shuttling. Overall, the proposed approach transforms waste tamarind peels into valuable resource for energy storage solutions. The notable electrochemical performance of the carbon material produced from tamarind peels, especially in the context of Li–S batteries, serves a dual purpose: managing agro-waste and providing economical, high-performance energy storage solutions.
