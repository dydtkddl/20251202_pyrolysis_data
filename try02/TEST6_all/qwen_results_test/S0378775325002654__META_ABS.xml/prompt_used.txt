You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tamarind peel-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon: A sustainable sulfur host for enhanced lithium–sulfur battery performance Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are an attractive energy storage solution due to their high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, their practical performance often falls short of theoretical expectations. To tackle the challenges from the cathode perspective, this study investigates the use of porous carbon derived from tamarind peel biomass as a sulfur host. Tamarind peel undergoes sequential pyrolysis, activation, and nitrogen doping to yield diverse porous carbon samples. The effects of activation and nitrogen doping are thoroughly examined through spectroscopic characterizations. Li–S cells are assembled using these carbon materials and subjected to comprehensive electrochemical measurements. The results show that activated nitrogen-doped carbon/sulfur composite electrode delivers an initial capacity of 1265 mAh g−1, maintains a high coulombic efficiency of 98% over 300 cycles, and exhibits stable rate capability up to 2C. These performance enhancements are attributed to hierarchical porous structure and polar surfaces introduced by nitrogen doping, which improve sulfur utilization and reduce polysulfide shuttling. Overall, the proposed approach transforms waste tamarind peels into valuable resource for energy storage solutions. The notable electrochemical performance of the carbon material produced from tamarind peels, especially in the context of Li–S batteries, serves a dual purpose: managing agro-waste and providing economical, high-performance energy storage solutions.
