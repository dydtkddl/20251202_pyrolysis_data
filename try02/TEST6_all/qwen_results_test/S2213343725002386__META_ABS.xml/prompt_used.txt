You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis liquid fuel production from waste plastics using spherical-shape zeolite catalyst A novel spherical zeolite catalyst was synthesized and used in the pyrolysis process to produce liquid fuel from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the synthesized spherical-shaped zeolite (SSZ) particles. Liquid fuels produced from the pyrolysis of individual and mixed waste plastics with or without SSZ catalyst were analyzed. When the SSZ catalyst was used, the yield of pyrolysis oil from PET increased from 38.1 % to 43.5 %, whereas it increased from 72.8 % to 84.6 % HDPE. For PET:HDPE mixed feedstock, the yield decreased from 78.5 % to 65.3 % as the PET:HDPE weight ratio was changed from 1:4–4:1 at an optimal temperature of 425°C and feedstock:SSZ catalyst ratio of 10:1. The pyrolysis liquid products were analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In the analysis of engine performance, the liquid fuel obtained from PET exhibited the highest average brake torque and power output. The specific fuel consumption decreased with increasing engine speed for all fuels. This research demonstrates the potential of SSZ catalytic pyrolysis as an effective method to produce liquid fuel products from waste plastics, thereby addressing both the environmental issues associated with waste plastics and the growing demand for petroleum-based fuels.
