You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable hydrogen production through catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass using carbon dioxide Although hydrogen is recognized a carbon-free fuel, its production face environmental challenges in carbon dioxide emissions due to energy-intensive processes. To pursue more sustainable hydrogen production, this study integrates carbon dioxide-cofed catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, especially perilla straw, with the water-gas shift reaction. The introduction of carbon dioxide into the pyrolysis process enhances syngas production per unit mass of perilla straw, while mitigating process-related carbon dioxide emissions. At temperatures above 460 °C, carbon dioxide participated in partial oxidation of volatiles stemming from perilla straw, leading to its reduction into carbon monoxide. To investigate this genuine reaction feature associated with carbon dioxide, the pyrolysis system was modified with an additional heat supply in the presence of cobalt-, iron-, or nickel-based catalysts. Catalytic pyrolysis facilitated further thermal cracking of the volatiles into smaller molecules, thereby accelerating carbon dioxide reactivity under enhanced mass transfer. These mechanisms related to carbon dioxide selectively promoted the formation of carbon monoxide. The resulting carbon monoxide-rich syngas was subsequently fed into the water-gas shift reaction, where carbon monoxide reacted with steam to stoichiometrically produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Thus, this study suggests the potential of carbon dioxide-cofed catalytic pyrolysis of perilla straw as an effective approach for enhancing hydrogen production while achieving process-related carbon dioxide reduction.
