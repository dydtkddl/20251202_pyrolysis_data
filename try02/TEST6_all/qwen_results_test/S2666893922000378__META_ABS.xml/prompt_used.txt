You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nitro-oxidation process for fabrication of efficient bioadsorbent from lignocellulosic biomass by combined liquid-gas phase treatment A sequential treatment involving HNO3 delignification in liquid phase and NO2-induced cellulose oxidation in gas phase was applied to raw jute fibers. The structure, chemical compositions, morphology and surface properties of the treated materials in each step were systematically characterized. First, delignification of jute fibers could occur at a mild HNO3 condition (30%, 25 °C, 6 h), capable of removing a significant portion of lignin without changing the native cellulose I structure. Subsequently, gas-phase NO2 treatment can oxidize partially delignified jute fibers and produce high concentrations of carboxyl groups (1.31–1.45 mmol/g) on the material surface, comparable to TEMPO-mediated oxidation. The resultant material is effective in removing positively charged contaminants, such as Thallium(I) ions from water (the removal efficiency >80%). The mixed liquid-gas phase nitro-oxidation process (NOP) provides better control of cellulose oxidation for fabrication of water remediation adsorbents from lignocellulose biomass and further reduces the energy and water consumption since there is no requirement for washing the oxidized cellulose after gas-phase NO2 treatment.
