You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Alkylation of phenol and substituted phenols with C1–C4 alcohols/olefins as an upgrading route for bio-oil oxygenates: A review The global concern for depletion of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emission demands a rigorous research on development of sustainable alternate fuels and important chemicals from the renewable second generation lignocellulosic biomass in the last decade. In this review, upgradation of pyrolysis bio-oil, derived from lignocellulosic biomass, using alkylation as an effective C–C coupling reaction between its phenolics and C1–C4 oxygenate constituents is discussed. There is a considerable loss of light oxygenates in existing bio-oil upgrading technologies employing hydrodeoxygenation process and this loss can be overcome by using them as alkylates in the alkylation reaction of the aromatic oxygenates, namely, phenolics, also present in it, before the subsequent hydrodeoxygenation step, which will avoid carbon loss and improve the yields of the valorization products. In this context, a review of research advances in the area of catalytic alkylation of phenolic compounds with different alkylating agents (C1–C4 alcohol/olefins) and with special attention to m-cresol alkylation with iso-propanol is discussed. This review classifies the reported literature into thermodynamic, catalytic activity, mechanistic, and kinetic analyses to give a clear picture of the research data on this reaction and an outlook for the process scale-up. The review of such reactions using this classification has not been reported so far.
