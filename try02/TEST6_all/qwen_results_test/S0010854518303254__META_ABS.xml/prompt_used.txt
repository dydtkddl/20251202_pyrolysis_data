You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemistry of gold(I, III) complexes with organic ligands as potential MOCVD precursors for fabrication of thin metallic films and nanoparticles The present review deals with the chemistry of complexes of gold(I) and gold(III) with organic ligands. Compounds classified according to the type of coordinating ligands and donor atoms are considered from the point of view of their potential application as precursors in the MOCVD process, which attract considerable scientific interest. This method has undeniable advantages over other technologies (precision multi-parameter monitoring in order to control the properties of the obtained coatings, high utilization of precursors, simple equipment design, etc.) and can be used to produce thin films and gold nanoparticles with desired characteristics on different types of surfaces of complex geometries for various engineering applications. The following main results published to date are summarized and analyzed in this review: (a) chemical approaches to synthesis, structural characteristics and properties of the main classes of organic compounds of gold(I, III), (b) thermal stability of gold compounds in solid state, (c) temperature-dependent measurements of vapor pressure used for the characterization of gold compound volatility, (d) thermolysis processes of gold complex vapor on heated substrates, (e) examples of modern high-precision applications of gold precursors in MOCVD technique of metallic layers and nanoparticles. Mechanisms and growth processes of gold films and nanoparticles, their composition, structure, and characteristics are also considered.
