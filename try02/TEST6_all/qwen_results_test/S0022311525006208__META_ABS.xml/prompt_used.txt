You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidation kinetics of pyrolytic graphite in combined air and steam environment for pyrochemical reprocessing application Accidental steam and air ingress into the pyrochemical reprocessing chamber can cause severe oxidation problems and potentially damage the integrity of graphite components. In the present study, the kinetics and mechanisms of pyrolytic graphite (PyG) oxidation were evaluated for the first time in a unique environment consisting of a mixture of air (38 vol.%) and steam (62 vol.%). The dynamic oxidation study showed increased thermal stability and oxidation onset temperature with increased pyrolysis temperature. The isothermal oxidation revealed a decrease in the linear rate constant values with increasing pyrolysis temperature across all isotherms. The higher activation energy barriers for commencing the oxidation process, with corresponding lower rate constant values, were evident for PyG synthesized at pyrolysis ≥ 2200 °C. The Arrhenius plot and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of surface morphology post isotherms revealed a two-stage oxidation regime and mechanisms. This work provides a new important benchmark, design, and safety guidance for conjoint air and steam ingress accidental scenarios for pyrochemical reprocessing plants.
