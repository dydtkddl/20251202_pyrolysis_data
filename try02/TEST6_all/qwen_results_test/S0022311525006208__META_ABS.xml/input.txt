Oxidation kinetics of pyrolytic graphite in combined air and steam environment for pyrochemical reprocessing application Accidental steam and air ingress into the pyrochemical reprocessing chamber can cause severe oxidation problems and potentially damage the integrity of graphite components. In the present study, the kinetics and mechanisms of pyrolytic graphite (PyG) oxidation were evaluated for the first time in a unique environment consisting of a mixture of air (38 vol.%) and steam (62 vol.%). The dynamic oxidation study showed increased thermal stability and oxidation onset temperature with increased pyrolysis temperature. The isothermal oxidation revealed a decrease in the linear rate constant values with increasing pyrolysis temperature across all isotherms. The higher activation energy barriers for commencing the oxidation process, with corresponding lower rate constant values, were evident for PyG synthesized at pyrolysis ≥ 2200 °C. The Arrhenius plot and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of surface morphology post isotherms revealed a two-stage oxidation regime and mechanisms. This work provides a new important benchmark, design, and safety guidance for conjoint air and steam ingress accidental scenarios for pyrochemical reprocessing plants.
