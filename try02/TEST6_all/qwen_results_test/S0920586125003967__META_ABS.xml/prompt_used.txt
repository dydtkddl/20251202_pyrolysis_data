You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of zeolite hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on water-assisted polyethylene hydrocracking The catalytic upcycling of polyethylene (PE) remains a major challenge in sustainable waste management. This study demonstrates that water promotes PE hydrocracking over Ru/zeolite catalysts only when the support framework is strongly hydrophilic, as in HY and HMOR. Systematic characterization reveals that this promotional effect is governed by surface wettability, rather than acidity or metal dispersion. Thermodynamic analysis confirms that water and PE are immiscible under reaction conditions, ruling out direct water–polymer interactions. Instead, water preferentially associates with hydrophilic catalyst surfaces, promoting Brønsted acid activity through confined hydration. Controlled experiments show that direct contact between water and the catalyst is essential for enhanced reactivity; spatial separation between the two leads to suppressed conversion, likely due to unfavorable interactions between water and the molten polymer. These findings highlight the mechanistic role of interfacial water–catalyst accessibility and establish catalyst hydrophilicity as a key design parameter for reliable and efficient water-assisted hydrocracking. The results have practical implications for processing moisture-containing plastic waste streams.
