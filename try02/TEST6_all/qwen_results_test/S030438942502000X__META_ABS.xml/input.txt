Multi-functionalities of citric acid assisted thermal hydrolysis for sludge pretreatment: A novel method assisting in sludge treatment targeting multiple-objectives Pretreatment is essential for enhancing sludge treatment efficiency, including anaerobic digestion, phosphorus recovery, sludge dewatering, and heavy metal removal. However, few techniques simultaneously address multiple treatment objectives. In this study, a novel multifunctional sludge treatment method, citric acid-assisted thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (CA-assisted THP), was proposed to simultaneously achieve multiple treatment objectives. Results revealed that CA-assisted THP enhanced the release of phosphorus and biodegradable organic matter, improved rheological properties and dewaterability of sludge, and effectively removed heavy metals. Under optimal conditions (170 °C, 1 h, 0.5 g/g TS CA), the mass of Cr, Ni, Zn, and Pb was reduced by 48.43 %, 60.03 %, 71.84 %, and 33.61 %, respectively. Sludge viscosity and moisture content decreased by 90.72 % and 10.23 %, respectively, while the release of TP and PO₄³ ⁻-P increased by 157.11 % and 52.51 %, respectively. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis identified CA as the most critical factor in achieving multiple effects, followed by temperature and reaction time. By combining experimental data with interpretable machine learning algorithms, the effectiveness of the CA-assisted THP method was comprehensively evaluated, which provided valuable insights into optimizing sludge treatment processes. This study underscored that appropriate combination of thermal hydrolysis and citric acid addition would be effective to enhance sludge treatment for multiple objectives.
