Ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production using engineered Cycas circinalis seed shell-derived heterogeneous catalyst The urgent need for alternative fuels arises from dwindling fossil fuel reserves and increasing global environmental concerns. Renewable energy must be generated from sources with a smaller ecological footprint. A viable alternative is biodiesel from plant-derived oils and animal fats. In this research, biodiesel was synthesized from Jatropha oil through ultrasonication-assisted transesterification, employing a novel biochar catalyst derived from Cycas circinalis seed shell. The catalyst was prepared by incorporating CaO sourced from eggshells and potassium carbonate and analyzed by FTIR, XRD, SEM, and EDS, while the biodiesel was analysed using NMR spectroscopy. The process was optimized using a Custom optimum design based on response surface methodology (RSM). A maximum biodiesel conversion of 95.5 % was achieved with a catalyst concentration of 3 wt%, a 15:1 methanol to oil ratio, 2 hr of reaction time, and a temperature of 60 °C. The high coefficients of determination, R2 of 96.97 % and R2 adj of 92.72 %, demonstrated a strong correlation between the fitted model and the predicted as well as actual biodiesel yield.
