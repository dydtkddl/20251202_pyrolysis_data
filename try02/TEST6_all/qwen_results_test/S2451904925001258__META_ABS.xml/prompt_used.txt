You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrasound-assisted biodiesel production using engineered Cycas circinalis seed shell-derived heterogeneous catalyst The urgent need for alternative fuels arises from dwindling fossil fuel reserves and increasing global environmental concerns. Renewable energy must be generated from sources with a smaller ecological footprint. A viable alternative is biodiesel from plant-derived oils and animal fats. In this research, biodiesel was synthesized from Jatropha oil through ultrasonication-assisted transesterification, employing a novel biochar catalyst derived from Cycas circinalis seed shell. The catalyst was prepared by incorporating CaO sourced from eggshells and potassium carbonate and analyzed by FTIR, XRD, SEM, and EDS, while the biodiesel was analysed using NMR spectroscopy. The process was optimized using a Custom optimum design based on response surface methodology (RSM). A maximum biodiesel conversion of 95.5 % was achieved with a catalyst concentration of 3 wt%, a 15:1 methanol to oil ratio, 2 hr of reaction time, and a temperature of 60 °C. The high coefficients of determination, R2 of 96.97 % and R2 adj of 92.72 %, demonstrated a strong correlation between the fitted model and the predicted as well as actual biodiesel yield.
