Constructing phase separation in polymer gels: Strategies, functions and applications Over the past decades, there has been a flourishing of phase-separated polymer gels. Unlike traditional design methods that rely on chemical structure and polymer network construction, phase separation enables polymers to tune morphologies across the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels, thereby creating a new path for regulating and innovating the performance of polymer gels. This comprehensive review offers a deep dive into the mechanisms underlying phase separation formation in polymer gels and makes a particular focus on the methods used to induce phase separation in polymer gels. Additionally, the review highlights the potential performance improvements and innovations of polymer gels based on phase separation and explores the promising applications of phase separation polymers in various fields. Finally, this review emphasizes the potential benefits yet significant challenges associated with phase-separated polymer gels. The versatility and multi-scale applicability of this approach make it a promising pathway for developing cutting-edge materials with tailored properties and functionalities.
