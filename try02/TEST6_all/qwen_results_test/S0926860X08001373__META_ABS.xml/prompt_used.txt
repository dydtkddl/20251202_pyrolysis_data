You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation of LDPE/VGO mixtures to fuels using a FCC equilibrium catalyst in a sand fluidized bed reactor Plastic degradation for recovery of useful products or raw materials is a very interesting alternative for reducing the plastic accumulation. This paper explores the possibility of using refinery facilities to carry out the plastic cracking as well as to take the most of the products obtained. In the present work, LDPE/VGO blends with different percentages of polymer are degraded in presence of a FCC equilibrium catalyst. The reactor used in this study is a laboratory scale sand fluidized bed reactor at 500°C, and a 7:1 catalyst:LDPE/VGO blend ratio in order to simulate the operating conditions in a large scale industrial reactor. Polyethylene blends evaluated show relative proportions of LDPE of 0, 6, 25, 75 and 100% (w/w). Gas and liquid compounds were collected and quantified. The results obtained are compared with those generated in a thermal cracking. In all cases, the FCC equilibrium catalyst showed a high selectivity to the production of isobutane and isopentane in the volatile compounds as well as to aromatics in the liquid products. Results shown in this paper evidences the viability of introducing plastics into FCC unit, producing potential valuable products from low value materials.
