You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Micro- and nanoplastics in wastewater treatment plants: Occurrence, removal, fate, impacts and remediation technologies – A critical review The manifestation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has become a major challenge owing to their unique characteristics such as hydrophobicity, surface charges, longer molecular chain arrangement, higher specific surface area, variety of size, shape, color and functional groups. They can also act as a vector in spreading other toxic pollutants in the environment by making convoluted complexes. Therefore, in this review, the up-to-date status on occurrence and removal of MPs and NPs in WWTPs are comprehensively evaluated. The stimuli of pertinent factors on the removal of MPs and NPs in WWTPs are also elucidated. Furthermore, the sorption behavior and mechanism of MPs and NPs towards toxic pollutants are critically debated in order to inspect the genuine menaces of MPs and NPs to WWTPs performance and environment. Particularly, the impacts of MPs and NPs on the performance of different wastewater treatment processes have been critically discussed. So far, no specific treatment technology has been developed specifically to remove MPs and NPs from sewage effluents and sludge excluding the subsisting conventional treatment techniques. Hence, to fill this gap, the recent research innovations on the development of MPs- and NPs-targeted treatment technologies are critically reviewed. Regarding this, the performances, pros and cons of the proposed technologies are critically evaluated that will be helpful in developing more reliable and cutting-edge technologies to eradicate MPs and NPs from the environment. Moreover, this critical review also provides knowledge gaps/key challenges and future perspectives for scientific community to combat against MPs and NPs pollution.
