You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The promise of graphene-based photocatalytic materials for wastewater remediation: A scoping review Graphene-based nanomaterials have attracted considerable interest for their outstanding performance in the photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants. This is primarily due to their high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent developments in the design, synthesis, and application of graphene and graphene oxide in photocatalysis. Key characterization techniques, including SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, are discussed to assess the structural and electronic features that influence photocatalytic performance. Graphene-based photocatalysts have demonstrated effective degradation of a wide range of pollutants, including pharmaceutical residues like tetracycline and ibuprofen, endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A and phthalates, and industrial contaminants like dyes, phenols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially under visible light irradiation. The review highlights advancements in hybrid composites, surface functionalization, and heterostructures that enhance light absorption, charge carrier separation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Despite their potential, several challenges hinder practical application, including high production costs, agglomeration tendencies, limited long-term reusability, and concerns about environmental toxicity in aquatic systems. To overcome these issues, recent innovations have focused on scalable synthesis techniques such as flash joule heating and the use of biomass-derived carbon sources. Furthermore, combining graphene with materials such as g-C3N4, MOFs, and doped semiconductors has significantly improved visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency. This review underscores the need for further development in recyclability and environmental safety. Graphene-based nanomaterials are emerging as promising candidates for next-generation solar-driven water purification and environmental remediation systems.
