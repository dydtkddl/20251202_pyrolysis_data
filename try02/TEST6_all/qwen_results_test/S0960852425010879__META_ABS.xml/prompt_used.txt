You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive study on microwave pyrolysis process variables and operating modes for optimized biochar production This study comprehensively investigates microwave-assisted pyrolysis of agroforestry waste into quality biochar through systematic evaluation of process variables, operating modes, and quantification techniques to address key challenges for production optimization. Building on this, 92 systematic experiments were conducted across various agroforestry residues, evaluating more than ten control parameters classified by their impact on yield and quality: primary (power, time, temperature, heating-rate, feedstock), secondary (moisture content, particle size, sweep-gas flow, susceptor use), and tertiary (reactor configuration, control modes). Four operating modes were investigated: constant power with/without high‐temperature alarm, fixed temperature, and controlled heating‐rate; and two novel metrics (carbonized amount and absolute yield) were studied alongside traditional metrics to more accurately quantify biochar production and quality. Microwave power and residence time emerged as the primary drivers of yield and carbonization, while heating rate and target temperature acted as fundamental dependent factors. Constant‐power operation without alarm achieved the highest reproducibility and absolute yield (up to 33.85 %), whereas controlled ramping produced biochars with HHV > 30 MJ/kg and fixed carbon > 70 %. Under optimal conditions of 500 W, 20–40 min residence time, 400–500 °C, 10–15 % moisture content, and < 3.15 mm particle size, energy efficiency reached up to 54.1 % while maintaining superior biochar quality. This comprehensive framework enables tunable, scalable microwave‐pyrolysis protocols for sustainable biochar production from biomass wastes.
