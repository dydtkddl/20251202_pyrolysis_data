Open-loop recycling of low-quality waste PET to purified terephthalic acid and environmentally friendly solvent via acetolysis: Economic and environmental benefits Streamlining and expanding industrial processes are key to solving the plastic crisis, reducing oil dependency, and promoting a circular economy. Using a solvent system similar to that in the production of purified terephthalic acid (PTA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) acetolysis technology can be quickly scaled up with existing equipment. This approach allows the processing of low-quality PET, reducing reliance on petroleum-based PTA and enhancing upcycling opportunities, thus offering potential economic benefits. A facility designed to produce 100,000 tons of recycled PTA (r-PTA) was evaluated for its energy use, profitability, and environmental impact. The analysis showed that r-PTA could be priced at 25–65 % of its petroleum-based counterpart while cutting carbon emissions by 48 % and reducing fossil fuel use by 60 %. The combination of higher economic benefits, reduced product prices, and lower environmental impact contributes to achieving a balanced cycle among economic, social, and environmental objectives.
