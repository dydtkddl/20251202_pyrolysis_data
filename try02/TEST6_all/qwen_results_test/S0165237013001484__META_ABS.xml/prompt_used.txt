You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Yields and ageing of the liquids obtained by slow pyrolysis of sorghum, switchgrass and corn stalks A laboratory scale reactor has been set up to pyrolyse different kinds of biomass under slow heating rates and a range of peak temperatures. Yields of solid and liquid products (i.e. char and oil) were measured allowing the effects of temperature and biomass feedstock to be determined. Small differences in char and oil yields were found between the three biomass feedstocks. Pyrolysis oil samples were collected and characterised with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), ultra violet fluorescence (UV-F) and infra red (IR) spectroscopies to study their structural changes as a function of time after collection, i.e. to assess the ageing of the bio-oils. The effects of several variables on the stability of product liquids were examined: e.g. pyrolysis temperature, storage temperature, solvent addition, type of biomass feedstock. Rapid structural changes in the oil samples were found to occur within about 48h of preparation. Ageing of oils is thought to be caused by polymerisation reactions taking place in the product liquids. The positive effects on the oil stabilisation due to low storage temperatures (5°C) and the addition of a solvent (methanol or acetone) were confirmed. However, in order to stop the ageing process completely, the concentration of these solvents in the final pyrolysis oil–solvent mixture needed to be greater than 25% (w/w). At lower solvent concentrations bio-oil ageing was slowed down but could not be suppressed altogether.
