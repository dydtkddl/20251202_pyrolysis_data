You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric Kinetics and High Fidelity Analysis of Crude Glycerol This work undertakes the determination of the glycerol thermochemical conversion kinetics in one hand, and the utilize of these quantities in high fidelity reactive flow model on the other. The kinetic parameters of glycerol are determined by using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) in the temperature range of 50-700 ͦC. Due to the distinct behavior of the crude glycerol, the TG curves of the thermal decomposition process were divided into several events, moisture release and two-subsequent devolatalization and gasification phases. The kinetic parameters, are calculated using four different methods: Arrhenius, Coats-Redfern, Ingraham Marrier and Differential Method. Results of the kinetics study were nearly consistent within the individual kinetic model but the discrepancy was more obvious amongst the different models. The resulted Coat-Redfirm kinetics were the best fit amongst other four considered methods demonstrated by its highest correlation R2. It resulted with activation energy of 62 kJ/mol and 138 kJ/mol and pre-exponential factor of 4.3e5 min-1 and 2.25e9 min-1 for phase 2 and phase 3, respectively. A high fidelity CFD model is developed to assess the performance of glycerol gasification in a tubular reactor. The model is governed by the Navier-stokes equations coupled to species transport equation for reactive flow under non-isothermal conditions. Results of the syngas conversion are in agreement with relevant literature and theoretical molar yield of 0.56 and 0.42 mole fractions for H2 and CO, respectively. The developed reactive flow model has brought more insight into the glycerol gasification, enabling further parametric studies in the pursuit of the optimal reactor design configuration and operating conditions for potential process integration.
