Engineering metal-organic frameworks via diverse shaping methods for enhanced sorption-based applications Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a promising porous material for sorption-based applications have received much attention. Despite their great potential showcased over the past decade, their utilization is mainly limited to the laboratory level, primarily due to the shortcomings of their powdery form. Hence, strategies for shaping MOFs for mechanical stability and enhanced heat and mass transfer are prioritized. Although mechanical compression with or without binders is commonly used, this approach reduces the sorption capacity of the MOF and prevents it from reaching ideal sorption kinetics. By contrast, the fabrication of MOF coatings and membranes and the formation of MOF monoliths have been explored to achieve structural integrity and superior performance. This review expands this scope by summarizing the state-of-the-art shaping methods of MOFs with diverse structures, analyzing the mechanisms for performance enhancement and demonstrating their application potential. Moreover, the challenges of scaling up MOF-based systems and the future outlook are presented to further the development of next-generation advanced MOF materials.
