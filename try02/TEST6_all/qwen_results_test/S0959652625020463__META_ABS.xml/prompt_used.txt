You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A tandem enzymatic-electro upcycling of waste PET into high-value chemicals: Process development and sustainability assessment for circular economy transition Achieving a circular economy for plastics is crucial; however, this transition is hindered by the limited economic feasibility of the current chemical recycling methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel tandem enzymatic-electro conversion process to upcycle waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into recycled terephthalic acid (r-TPA) and valuable by-products. Two conversion pathways were designed, producing glycolic acid or formic acid as by-products and combining them with four different separation processes, resulting in eight different process configurations. Detailed techno-economic and environmental assessments identified the glycolic acid production pathway with reverse osmosis as the optimal configuration (EEG-RO process), achieving a unit production cost of 1.27 $/kgTPA. The net CO2eq emission was calculated as 1.72 kgCO2eq/kgTPA, which is lower than that of fossil-based TPA production. Sensitivity analysis underscored the importance of PET flake costs, by-product credits, and technological advancements, while uncertainty analysis revealed economic fluctuations arising from cost uncertainties. Furthermore, our sustainability assessment quantitatively analyzes the environmental benefits derived from integrating r-TPA into PET production and underscores the role of supportive policies that enhance the economic viability of the PET recycling system. This study provides valuable insights for designing sustainable PET recycling systems and contributes to accelerating the global transition toward a circular PET economy.
