You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic analysis of hydrogen-rich Co-gasification of pine wood and polypropylene-based waste masks using Fe/Dol catalyst Disposable masks, predominantly made of polypropylene melt-blown fabric, present a significant environmental challenge due to their large volume and resistance to natural degradation. This study explores the co-gasification of forestry waste, specifically pine wood, and waste masks to enhance biomass gasification efficiency while enabling the high-value utilization of waste materials. The Fe/Dol catalyst, prepared by loading transition metal Fe onto calcined dolomite using the impregnation method, was tested in a two-stage fixed-bed gasification system. Steam was employed as the gasifying agent. The study systematically examines the effects of steam flow rate, gasification reforming temperature, the mixing ratio of pine wood to masks, and Fe loading on the catalyst's performance in gas-phase and liquid-phase product formation.Characterization analyses revealed that Fe oxides facilitate the cleavage of aromatic rings in aromatic compounds, leading to the formation of two-carbon chain segments and promoting the production of ethylene and propylene from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, the catalyst enhanced tar cracking, generating free radicals and ring bonds. Experimental results indicate that at a steam flow rate of 3 mg/min, a gasification temperature of 850 °C, a pine wood to mask mixing ratio of 1:2, and an Fe loading of 8 %, the hydrogen (H2) volume fraction reached 52.48 %, with a gas yield of 1.67 m³/kg and a hydrogen production rate of 78.25 g/kg.
