You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Studies on PLA grafting onto graphene oxide and its effect on the ensuing composite films Polylactide (PLA) with a terminal triple bond was synthesized by organocatalyzed ring-opening polymerization and coupled with azide-functionalized graphene oxide (GO) through an azide-alkyne cycloaddition “click” reaction. The functionalized graphenic species involved were analyzed by spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, solid state 13C NMR, Raman), which confirmed the coupling of PLA and GO. Additionally, an in depth study of the prepared GO, intermediates and GO-g-PLA hybrid was carried out that sheds light on the mechanisms involved in the functionalization path. The obtained GO-g-PLA hybrid, containing at least 20% of biopolymer, presented an exfoliated graphenic structure, as established by XRD. The conditions used in the grafting of the PLA chains inhibited the crystallization and melting observed for the free polymer. Furthermore, the graphene oxide seems to be reduced during functionalization, which can also be an advantage. Nanocomposites were obtained as solvent-cast films, prepared by dispersion of the GO-g-PLA hybrid in commercial PLA. Preliminary results regarding the performance of these nanocomposites, obtained by DSC and DMA, highlighted the effect of functionalization. Loading values as low as 0.5% suffice to improve the mechanical properties over a broad temperature range due to the high surface area resulting from the good dispersibility of polymer functionalized nanofillers and/or their effect on the polymer chain organization.
