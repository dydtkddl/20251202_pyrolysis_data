Impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blended plastics Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is a biodegradable plastic that is difficult to degrade under both mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic conditions. In this study, the impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment (48 h, 70 °C, 1 % w/v NaOH) on the anaerobic degradation (AD) of PBAT, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PBAT/PLA blended plastics was investigated. Under mesophilic conditions, pretreatment only improved the methane yield of PBAT/PLA/starch plastic (100 days, 51 and 34 NmL/g VSadd for the treated and original plastics, respectively). Under thermophilic conditions, the pretreatment increased the methanogenic rate of PLA, PBAT and PBAT/PLA/starch plastic at the beginning stage (22 days, 35 and 79 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT, respectively), but did not change the methane yield at the end of the incubation (100 days, 91 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT). The reduction in the molecular weight and the formation of pore structures on the plastic surface accelerated the utilization of plastics by microorganisms. Furthermore, the pretreated plastics tend to form microplastics (MPs) with size predominantly below 500 µm (>90 %). The numbers of MPs dynamically changed with the degradation time. Several genera of bacteria showed specific degradation of biodegradable plastics under thermophilic conditions, including Desulfitibacter, Coprothermobacter, Tepidimicrobium, c_ D8A-2 and Thermacetogenium. The results suggest that more attention should be paid to the problem of MPs arising from the thermo-alkaline pretreatment.
