You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blended plastics Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is a biodegradable plastic that is difficult to degrade under both mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic conditions. In this study, the impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment (48 h, 70 °C, 1 % w/v NaOH) on the anaerobic degradation (AD) of PBAT, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PBAT/PLA blended plastics was investigated. Under mesophilic conditions, pretreatment only improved the methane yield of PBAT/PLA/starch plastic (100 days, 51 and 34 NmL/g VSadd for the treated and original plastics, respectively). Under thermophilic conditions, the pretreatment increased the methanogenic rate of PLA, PBAT and PBAT/PLA/starch plastic at the beginning stage (22 days, 35 and 79 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT, respectively), but did not change the methane yield at the end of the incubation (100 days, 91 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT). The reduction in the molecular weight and the formation of pore structures on the plastic surface accelerated the utilization of plastics by microorganisms. Furthermore, the pretreated plastics tend to form microplastics (MPs) with size predominantly below 500 µm (>90 %). The numbers of MPs dynamically changed with the degradation time. Several genera of bacteria showed specific degradation of biodegradable plastics under thermophilic conditions, including Desulfitibacter, Coprothermobacter, Tepidimicrobium, c_ D8A-2 and Thermacetogenium. The results suggest that more attention should be paid to the problem of MPs arising from the thermo-alkaline pretreatment.
