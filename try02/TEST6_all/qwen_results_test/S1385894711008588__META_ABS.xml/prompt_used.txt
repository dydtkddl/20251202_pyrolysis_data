You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of PET by catalyzed glycolysis: Kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction Polyethylene terephthalate post-consume (PET-pc) glycolysis was investigated by the use of ethylene glycol (EG) and zinc acetate, as catalyst. It was focused the kinetic aspects through use of mathematical model specially developed for application in this study. The grains-lot was sieved in different size ranges and a relation between surface area and granulometry, surface area and temperature on the conversion and depolymerization rate was proposed. At temperatures ranging 180–190°C the depolymerization rate is quite elevated and almost 100% of conversion is obtained up to 3 or 4h reaction time. For lower temperatures (170–180°C), equilibrium is achieved and it becomes more important as the temperature is decreased. The conversion profile showed an initial activation stage where the mass transfer between the liquid and solid phases is minimal. The proposed mathematic model was based on these findings and on reaction mechanism that differentiates the reaction sites present in the PET surface. By that model the value of rate constant (k) for each temperature, and the dependence of k with 1/T was calculated. Four our best knowledge it is the first time that a mathematical model considers the activation stage in the earlier times of PET depolymerization reaction. The inputs yielding, time and temperature were included in the used mathematical model that fits very well the experimental data obtained at temperatures higher than 180°C. This model helps to predict the necessary mass of PET for producing a desired amount of products.
