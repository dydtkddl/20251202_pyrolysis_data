Design and optimization of a solar-driven methane dry reforming reactor by developing an optical-thermal-chemical model The reactor plays a crucial role in solar-driven methane dry reforming. To improve the reactor performance, a cavity reactor with a hemispherical porous absorber and a secondary concentrator was designed and optimized by developing an optical-thermal-chemical coupled model. Using this model, the effects of different pore parameters on the reactor performance were firstly investigated, finding that porosity and pore size significantly influence the distributions of solar energy and temperature but mildly influence the reforming performance. Considering the optical-chemical efficiency as the optimization objective, the reactor with the porosity of 0.85 and the pore size of 1 mm was suggested as the optimal design. Then, the influences of the CO2:CH4 feed molar ratio, incident power, and the inlet volumetric flow rate were analyzed, revealing that they dramatically influence the reactor performance in complex ways. To make a compromise between the optical-chemical efficiency and carbon deposition, the operating condition with the CO2:CH4 feed molar ratio of 1:1, the inlet volumetric flow rate of 0.6 L·s−1, and the incident power of 3 kW was selected as the optimal one. Finally, the performance of the optimal reactor was evaluated at the optimal condition, finding it can achieve quite high methane conversion ratio, optical-chemical efficiency, and optical-thermal efficiency of 36.71 %, 30.88 %, and 59.05 %, respectively. Results from present work can provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of solar reactors.
