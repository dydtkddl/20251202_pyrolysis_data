You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication and characterization of ZSM-5 zeolite modified with silver and assessing its performance in petroleum waste cracking process The purpose of this study is to modify the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite with the aim of enhancing its performance in the cracking process for the conversion of petroleum waste into higher-value products. ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method subsequently, the structure of the zeolite was modified by incorporating silver using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Then the synthesized sample was evaluated for its performance in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process, conducted under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 450 °C. The performance of the silver-doped ZSM-5 zeolite was compared to that of a basic catalyst, which employed USY (ultra-stable Y) zeolite. To characterize the silver-doped ZSM-5 zeolite, various analytical techniques were employed. These included X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) and N2 adsorption–desorption. The findings of the study revealed that the modification of ZSM-5 zeolite's structure with silver led to an increase in the yield of propylene production from 6.99 % to 9.78 %. Additionally, the results demonstrated that the incorporation of silver into the zeolite structure enhanced the yield reaction, as evidenced by the measurement of American Petroleum Institute (API) index. The presence of smaller pores and the specific types of pores in Ag/ZSM-5 zeolite reduced secondary reactions. Moreover, the interaction between silver species and strong acid sites within the modified zeolite structure limited hydrogen transfer reactions and consequently increased the zeolite's overall activity.
