You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A component synergy of flue gas torrefaction of municipal solid waste Flue gas torrefaction (FGT) is a promising pretreatment to improve the fuel properties of municipal solid waste (MSW). A synergistic effect between paper, wood and PVC was studied in flue gas and nitrogen torrefaction atmospheres. FGT presented superior potential in improving fuel properties compared to nitrogen torrefaction (NT). Notably, the synergistic effect between different ingredients in FGT could reduce mass and energy losses effectively, especially the combination of PVC with other materials. Besides, the FGT samples exhibited better thermal stability than NT samples during pyrolysis and combustion. Simultaneously, FGT led to the released flammable gases (H2 and CO) increase, while H2O decrease. Satisfyingly, less gaseous pollutants were released during the FGT samples combustion, attributed to the reduction of light volatiles and the enrichment of char and heavy volatiles. Moreover, the positive synergistic effects of FGT or NT blended samples were found in the pyrolysis (in phase B: ∆WNT-DTG = 4.79–5.20 and ∆WFGT-DTG = 0.78–1.18) and combustion (in phase B: ∆WNT-DTG = 6.03–16.07 and ∆WFGT-DTG = 1.56–13.4). This study can provide a theoretical reference for the efficient and clean treatment of MSW.
