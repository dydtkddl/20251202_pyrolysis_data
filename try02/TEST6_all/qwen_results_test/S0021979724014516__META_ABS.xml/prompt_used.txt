You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

TiO2-based photocatalysts from type-II to S-scheme heterojunction and their applications Photocatalysis is a promising sustainable technology to remove organic pollution and convert solar energy into chemical energy. Titanium dioxide has drawn extensive attention in this field owing to its high activity under UV light, good chemical stability, large availability, low price and low toxicity. However, the poor quantum efficiency derived from fast electron/hole recombination, the limited utilization of sunlight, and a weak reducing ability still hinder its practical application. Among the modification strategies of TiO2 to enhance its performance, the construction of heterojunctions with other semiconductors is a powerful and versatile way to maximise the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and steer their transport toward enhanced efficiency and selectivity. Here, the research progress and current status of TiO2 modification are reviewed, focusing on heterojunctions. A rapid evolution of the understanding of the different charge transfer mechanisms is witnessed from traditional type II to the recently conceptualised S-scheme. Particular attention is paid to different synthetic approaches and interface engineering methods designed to improve and control the interfacial charge transfer, and several cases of TiO2 heterostructures with metal oxides, metal sulfides and carbon nitride are discussed. The application hotspots of TiO2-based photocatalysts are summarized, including hydrogen generation by water splitting, solar fuel production by CO2 conversion, and the degradation of organic water pollutants. Hints about less studied and emerging processes are also provided. Finally, the main issues and challenges related to the sustainability and scalability of photocatalytic technologies in view of their commercialization are highlighted, outlining future directions of development.
