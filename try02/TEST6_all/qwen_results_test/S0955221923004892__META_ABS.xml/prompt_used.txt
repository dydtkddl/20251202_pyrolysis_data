You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Powder bed fusion of polyamide powders combined with different preceramic polymers infiltration and pyrolysis to produce complex-shaped ceramics The fabrication of a wide range of polymer-derived ceramic parts with high geometric complexity through a novel hybrid additive manufacturing technique is presented in this article. The process that we introduced in a previous work uses the powder bed fusion technology to manufacture high porous polymeric preforms to be then converted into ceramics through preceramic polymer infiltration and pyrolysis. The cellular architectures of a rotated cube (strut-based) and a gyroid (sheet-based) with 25 mm diameter, 44 mm height and 67 % of geometric macroporosity were generated and used for the fabrication. The complex structures were 3D printed and polycarbosilane, polycarbosiloxane, polysilazane and furan liquid polymers were used to produce SiC, SiOC, SiCN and glassy carbon, respectively. Despite a linear shrinkage of about 24 %, the parts maintained their designed complex shape without deformations. The significant advantages of the proposed method are the maturity of powder bed fusion for polymers with respect to ceramic additive manufacturing techniques and the possibility to fabricate net-shape complex ceramic parts directly from preceramic precursors.
