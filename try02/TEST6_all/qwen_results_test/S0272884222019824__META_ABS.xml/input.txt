6-step manufacturing process of hydroxyapatite filler with specific properties applied for bone cement composites Acrylic bone cement is commonly used in orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, and the treatment of spine compression fractures. Modification of existing cement and the creation of new biomaterials play a key role in achieving success in the process of treating patients and improving the quality and comfort of their lives. This study aims to manufacture and characterize hydroxyapatite (HAp) powder that can be successfully incorporated into a PMMA-based matrix and improve the final properties of composite bone cement. HAp was manufactured in a 6-step procedure where the last step is a surface modification of produced powder ceramic. The surface was changed using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) by attaching methyl and methylene groups on the HAp surface, which significantly increased the degree of dispersion of this filler in the polymer matrix. The paper describes in detail the morphology, chemical structure, phase composition, free surface energy, and specific surface area. Biological studies have additionally proved that the tested material is biocompatible with bone-forming SAOS-2 cells.
