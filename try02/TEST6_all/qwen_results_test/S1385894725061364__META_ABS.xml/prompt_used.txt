You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorizing non-condensable pyrolysis gases from mixed plastic waste: A comprehensive parametric study of the cross-metathesis reaction for propylene production This work focuses on the valorization of the non-condensable pyrolysis gases (NCPGs) derived from mixed plastic waste (MPW). A feedstock consisting of ethylene and 1-butene, primary constituents of NCPGs, was utilized for propylene production via cross-metathesis reaction. A comprehensive parametric study was performed on a series of xWO3/Al-MCM-41 catalysts. The effect of temperature, Si/Al ratio, WO3 loading, residence time (Wcat/F0), feed ratio (ethylene/1-butene), and reactants partial pressure were investigated. Ex situ and in situ characterization techniques (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, BET, FT-IR (study of pyridine adsorption), TPO, TPR, and EXAFS) were applied to the fresh and used catalysts. Αluminum (Al) incorporation into the MCM-41 structure promoted both Lewis and Brønsted acidity, favoring the isomerization reaction of 1-butene to 2-butene. The tungsten oxo (W=O) species served as the precursor for the active site for propylene production through the cross-metathesis reaction. The 20 wt% WO3/Al-MCM-41 catalyst, with a Si/Al ratio of 30, attained a remarkable performance at 550 °C, 1 bar, Wcat/F0 = 117.4 kgCat·s·mol−1 and ethylene/1-butene = 4.5/1. Under these conditions, the ethylene and 1-butene conversions reached 28% and 97%, respectively, along with a C-based selectivity of 73% towards propylene.
