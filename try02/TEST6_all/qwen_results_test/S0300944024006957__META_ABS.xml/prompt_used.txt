You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flame-retardant coatings for wooden structures Wood remained an integral part of building structures across the globe. Concerns have nonetheless arisen about wood having inherent high flammability and threatening the fire safety of buildings and inhabitants, leading to the need for enhancement of flame resistivity. The use of flame-retardants that possessed ease of application and cost-effectiveness to mitigate the threat of flammable wood is compelling in current development. Among the diversity of methods, the flame-retardant coating applied on wood offers advanced fire protection. This review aims to provide significant insights into the evaluation methods and regulations followed globally, serving as a guideline for evaluating the flame retardancy of wood structures in building construction. A comprehensive discussion is performed on the mechanisms of various elements to impart the flame retardancy of the polymeric coating. In addition to these traditional flame retardants, the review emphasises the growing interest in bio-based materials as sustainable alternatives. Bio-based flame retardants offer numerous environmental benefits and demonstrate promising flame-retardant properties through various mechanisms. An understanding of the current advancements in flame retardant polymeric coatings for wood is provided, highlighting the potential of bio-based materials in creating more sustainable and effective fire protection solutions.
