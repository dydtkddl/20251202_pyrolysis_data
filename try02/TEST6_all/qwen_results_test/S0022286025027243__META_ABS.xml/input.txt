Analysis of molecular structures for pollutant degradation: Recovery of liquid crystals and heavy metals from display panels via physical and chemical processes The rapid proliferation of electronic devices with Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) has led to a significant increase in electronic waste (e-waste), posing serious environmental and health challenges. LCDs contain complex and hazardous materials, including indium tin oxide (ITO), rare earth elements (REEs), liquid crystals, and various heavy metals, which are difficult to recycle and can release harmful substances when improperly disposed of. Traditional recycling methods, such as acid leaching and thermal treatments, are inefficient, environmentally damaging, and fail to recover valuable materials like indium effectively. Alternatively, innovative recycling techniques are being developed to address these issues while minimizing environmental impact. Methods such as bioleaching, ultrasound-assisted leaching, and subcritical water treatment show promise in recovering valuable metals and reducing reliance on harsh chemicals. Bio-based approaches, including the use of fungi like Aspergillus niger, combined with physical pre-treatment methods, have also demonstrated potential for sustainable recycling. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in managing toxic liquid crystal monomers (LCMs), which are persistent and bioaccumulative, highlighting the need for further research and improved management practices. By optimizing material recovery and adopting sustainable recycling techniques, these innovations can support a circular economy, reduce reliance on primary mining, and mitigate the environmental impact of e-waste. As the demand for electronic devices grows, these efforts are essential to develop more sustainable and eco-friendly approach to electronic waste management via physical and chemical processes.
