You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of aromatic hydrocarbons via catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and polypropylene The effects of the torrefaction of cellulose on catalytic co-pyrolysis with polypropylene (PP) over HZSM-5 and HBeta catalysts were examined in a pyrolyzer-GC/MS/TCD/FID system. Torrefied cellulose produced larger quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons during catalytic pyrolysis over both BETA and HZSM-5 catalysts than raw cellulose due to the change in crystallinity and structure of cellulose. Among the catalysts tested, HZSM-5(30) showed the highest performance for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons from the catalytic pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose. The synergy effect for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons was also observed on the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and PP over HZSM-5, even when a low catalyst to sample ratio was applied. The maximum BTEXs yield (33.4wt.%) was achieved from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and PP at a catalyst to sample ratio of 3/1 and a torrefied cellulose to PP ratio of 1/3.
