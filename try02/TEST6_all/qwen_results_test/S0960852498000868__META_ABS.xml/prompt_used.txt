You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State of the art of applied fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic materials — a review Pyrolysis is the degradation of macromolecular materials with heat alone in the absence of oxygen. It has both analytical and applied aspects. The development of advanced fast pyrolysis processes for liquids production has gained much attention in the last decade, because they offer a convenient way to convert low value woody residues into liquid fuels and value-added products. This review describes the new pyrolysis reactors under development. The systems based on (bubbling) fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed reactors are presented. Moreover, the principles of ablative pyrolysis techniques such as the rotating blade and rotating cone reactors including the vortex system are outlined and a vacuum pyrolysis system, a recent technical development, is also presented. The international activities within the International Energy Agency and European Union are shortly outlined with special emphasis on the chemical and physical properties of pyrolysis oils and the methods for their upgrading and utilization as fuel and chemical feedstock. The pyrolysis liquids obtained in a yield of ca. 70% (based on dry wood) are complex mixtures of oxygenated aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Their energetic utilization is being tested in burners, Diesel engines and turbines. Commercial applications exist in the field of production of food aromas. Emerging areas of utilization are: additives for flue gas cleaning of coal combustion; acetic acid for chip production; adhesives; fuel enhancers; specialty chemicals; and fertilizers.
