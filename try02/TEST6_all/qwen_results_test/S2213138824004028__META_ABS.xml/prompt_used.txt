You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling and optimization of biomethanation of rice straw with biochar supplementation using response surface methodology and machine learning Anaerobic digestion (AD) of lignocellulosic wastes offers sustainable waste management with the production of renewable energy and nutrient-rich bio-slurry. However, the chemical recalcitrant structure of lignocellulosic waste hinders its hydrolysis and biomethanation under AD. Biochar addition has been reported to alleviate toxicity inhibition and improve the degradability of lignocellulosic wastes, biogas and methane yield, and stability of the AD process. Therefore, in this study, substrate loading (% total solids (TS)), inoculum loading (% TS), and biochar dosage (w/v%) were optimized to maximize the methane yield by using central composite design (CCD) based response surface methodology (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA). The second-order quadratic model was established by CCD-RSM, which revealed the notable interaction between substrate loading and biochar dosage (p-value < 0.0001) and between inoculum loading and biochar dosage (p-value < 0.05). Based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) values, the cumulative methane yield (CMY) prediction performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) (RMSE = 0.876, R2 = 0.9894) was more reliable and accurate than CCD-RSM (RMSE = 3.34, R2 = 0.9956). The GA optimal conditions showed 8.6% higher methane yield (293.7 ± 7.26 mL/g VS) than the CCD-RSM (270.2 ± 10.69 mL/g VS). The methane yield obtained at optimal conditions of GA was 54.9% higher than the control. The CCD-RSM and ANN-GA can also be used for process modeling and optimization in other contexts. The optimal outcomes obtained in this study could pave the way for the prediction and operation of continuous AD of rice straw supplemented with additives such as biochar for large-scale bioenergy production.
