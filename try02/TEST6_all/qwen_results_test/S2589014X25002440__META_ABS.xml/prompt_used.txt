You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process development of zeolite-Y-catalyst from Kulende MetaKaolin: Experimental data modelling, process optimization, computer-aided scale-up techno-economics and zeolite-Y-catalyst application for biodiesel production Most existing studies on zeolite-Y synthesis remain at the laboratory-scale, limiting process design and industrial application. This study optimized key variables: acid concentration, quench time, and NaOH:KMK for the synthesis of zeolite-Y from the Kulende Metakaolin. The optimal zeolite-Y synthesis condition was simulated, scaled-up and its feasibility study was performed through Techno economic analysis. The synthesized zeolite-Y was tested in the transesterification process. Optimal conditions (65.97 % acid, 3.89 min quenching, and 1.99 NaOH:KMK) was used for zeolite-Y synthesis. The lab-optimized process was simulated and scaled up to 4000 kg/batch, achieving 104 batches/year, 0.65 kg/min production rate, and 5.8 million kJ total energy consumed. Techno-economic analysis confirmed feasibility, with a 15-year investment yielding a NPV of $9.59 million, 27.23 % IRR, and 27 % ROI. The synthesized zeolite-Y was successfully tested for biodiesel production, with both products respectively characterized. This study demonstrates that zeolite-Y from KMK is scalable, economically viable, and suitable for industrial biodiesel production.
