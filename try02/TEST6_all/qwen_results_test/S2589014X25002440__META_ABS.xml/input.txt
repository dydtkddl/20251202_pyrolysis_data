Process development of zeolite-Y-catalyst from Kulende MetaKaolin: Experimental data modelling, process optimization, computer-aided scale-up techno-economics and zeolite-Y-catalyst application for biodiesel production Most existing studies on zeolite-Y synthesis remain at the laboratory-scale, limiting process design and industrial application. This study optimized key variables: acid concentration, quench time, and NaOH:KMK for the synthesis of zeolite-Y from the Kulende Metakaolin. The optimal zeolite-Y synthesis condition was simulated, scaled-up and its feasibility study was performed through Techno economic analysis. The synthesized zeolite-Y was tested in the transesterification process. Optimal conditions (65.97 % acid, 3.89 min quenching, and 1.99 NaOH:KMK) was used for zeolite-Y synthesis. The lab-optimized process was simulated and scaled up to 4000 kg/batch, achieving 104 batches/year, 0.65 kg/min production rate, and 5.8 million kJ total energy consumed. Techno-economic analysis confirmed feasibility, with a 15-year investment yielding a NPV of $9.59 million, 27.23 % IRR, and 27 % ROI. The synthesized zeolite-Y was successfully tested for biodiesel production, with both products respectively characterized. This study demonstrates that zeolite-Y from KMK is scalable, economically viable, and suitable for industrial biodiesel production.
