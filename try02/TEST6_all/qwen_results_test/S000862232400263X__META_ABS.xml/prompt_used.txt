You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A new strategy for preparing high oil content PAO40@HMCs microcapsules for improving tribological properties of PA6 composites Enhancing the tribological characteristics of polyamide 6 (PA6) represents an effective strategy for extending the service life of self-lubricating PA6 composites. In this investigation, hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCs) with an average diameter of 10 μm were synthesized using the template method, and the crucial factors influencing HMCs preparation were thoroughly examined. Successful synthesis of polyalphaolefin oil-containing microcapsules (PAO40@HMCs) was achieved, utilizing HMCs as microcontainers and PAO40 lubricant as the core material. The self-lubricating PAO40@HMCs microcapsules exhibited a notable oil content of 76.0 wt%. The tribological properties of the prepared self-lubricating PA6 composites were significantly better than those of pure PA6. When the content of PAO40@HMCs microcapsules in the composite reached 7 wt%, the coefficient of friction (COF) for the PA6 composite decreased by 87.9% (from 0.420 to 0.051), and the wear loss was reduced by 80% (from 0.115 to 0.023 g/0.5h). Through an analysis of the morphology and transfer film of the wear surface and friction pair, it was evident that microcapsules played a pivotal role in enhancing the self-lubricating properties of PA6 composites.
