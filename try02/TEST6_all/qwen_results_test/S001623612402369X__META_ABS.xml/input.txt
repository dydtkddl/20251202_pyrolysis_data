Review on recent development in catalytic cracking of waste polyolefins: Effect of zeolite-based catalysts and reaction parameters Plastics are deeply integrated into human life in various forms, especially in household applications and the food industry. The production of plastic has increased due to rising demand and population growth. Unfortunately, less than 10 % of plastic is recycled after use. The remainder is either disposed of in landfills, bodies of water, or incinerated. Among the various methods of recycling, catalytic cracking is particularly important because it produces fuel, which is in high demand, further reducing energy consumption and controlling product distribution. This review focuses on the catalytic cracking of polyethylene and propylene using a wide range of zeolites, demonstrating that the product distributions is highly dependent upon the nature of zeolites including pore size, acidity, composition, and morphology. Additionally, the review briefly discusses the various parameters that influence cracking and the reaction mechanism. Each section was critically evaluated, highlighting the recent research progress in this field.
