You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mesoporous metal oxide/pyrophosphate hybrid originated from reutilization of water treatment resin as a novel fire hazard suppressant Flexible poly(vinyl chloride) (fPVC) composites undertake potential high fire and smoke hazards. Withal, commercial flame retardant, antimony trioxide (Sb2O3), in application to fPVC is proved to be harmful anyhow. Meanwhile, corrosive HCl gas evolves inevitably from fPVC during combustion. In this article, mesoporous SnO2/Ca2P2O7 hybrid crystals with high specific surface area and pore volume was firstly synthesized via a facile way by utilization of the chelating resin as the precursor. The composition and structure of the hybrid material were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope/transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray detector and N2 sorption isotherms. The results from limiting oxygen index, vertical burning test and cone calorimeter showed that the synthesized product reduced the fire and smoke hazards of fPVC and decreased the amount of HCl gas emission due to the combined impact of SnO2 and Ca2P2O7. Moreover, this novel flame retardant holds great potential to replace antimony trioxide and provides the promising manner to develop Sb2O3-free environmental friendly fPVC composite with low fire hazards.
