You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable biorefinery approach by utilizing xylose fraction of lignocellulosic biomass Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has been a lucrative feedstock for developing biochemical products due to its rich organic content, low carbon footprint and abundant accessibility. The recalcitrant nature of this feedstock is a foremost bottleneck. It needs suitable pretreatment techniques to achieve a high yield of sugar fractions such as glucose and xylose with low inhibitory components. Cellulosic sugars are commonly used for the bio-manufacturing process, and the xylose sugar, which is predominant in the hemicellulosic fraction, is rejected as most cell factories lack the five‑carbon metabolic pathways. In the present review, more emphasis was placed on the efficient pretreatment techniques developed for disintegrating LCB and enhancing xylose sugars. Further, the transformation of the xylose to value-added products through chemo-catalytic routes was highlighted. In addition, the review also recapitulates the sustainable production of biochemicals by native xylose assimilating microbes and engineering the metabolic pathway to ameliorate biomanufacturing using xylose as the sole carbon source. Overall, this review will give an edge on the bioprocessing of microbial metabolism for the efficient utilization of xylose in the LCB.
