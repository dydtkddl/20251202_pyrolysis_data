Sustainable biorefinery approach by utilizing xylose fraction of lignocellulosic biomass Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has been a lucrative feedstock for developing biochemical products due to its rich organic content, low carbon footprint and abundant accessibility. The recalcitrant nature of this feedstock is a foremost bottleneck. It needs suitable pretreatment techniques to achieve a high yield of sugar fractions such as glucose and xylose with low inhibitory components. Cellulosic sugars are commonly used for the bio-manufacturing process, and the xylose sugar, which is predominant in the hemicellulosic fraction, is rejected as most cell factories lack the five‑carbon metabolic pathways. In the present review, more emphasis was placed on the efficient pretreatment techniques developed for disintegrating LCB and enhancing xylose sugars. Further, the transformation of the xylose to value-added products through chemo-catalytic routes was highlighted. In addition, the review also recapitulates the sustainable production of biochemicals by native xylose assimilating microbes and engineering the metabolic pathway to ameliorate biomanufacturing using xylose as the sole carbon source. Overall, this review will give an edge on the bioprocessing of microbial metabolism for the efficient utilization of xylose in the LCB.
