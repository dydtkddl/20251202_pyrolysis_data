You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Silicon photovoltaic modules at end-of-life: Removal of polymeric layers and separation of materials An eco-friendly process to recover valuable materials deriving from silicon based photovoltaic panels at end-of-life has been proposed. In particular, in this paper a new two-step process to separate and recover glass, Si and metals has been investigated and discussed. A preliminary mechanical treatment to remove fluorinated polymers allows to exclude dangerous emissions of hydrofluoric acid and fluorinated compounds coming out from conventional heat treatments. A subsequent thermal treatment allows the complete removal of the residual polymers and the separation of valuable materials. The influence of treatment time, temperature and atmosphere, during the polymers degradation has been evaluated and the by-products have been examined. The process efficiency has been assessed by determining the quantity and quality of the recovered materials. The results have shown that the combination of the two mechanical/thermal processes allows energy efficiency and environmental sustainability with respect to conventional recovery treatments. The optimal operating conditions for the thermal treatment have turned out 500 °C for 1 h in oxidizing atmosphere. The quality of the recovered materials has been determined by analysing the residual carbon content after the thermal treatment. The gaseous products of the polymeric degradation have been characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis.
