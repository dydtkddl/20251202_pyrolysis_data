  "pyrolysis_related": "YES",
  "reason": "The study involves thermal treatment of polymeric layers from end-of-life photovoltaic modules, with GC–MS analysis of gaseous products, temperature–yield relationships, and measurable product characterization, satisfying all criteria for plastic pyrolysis at lab scale with extractable data."
