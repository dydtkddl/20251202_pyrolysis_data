You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of LDPE plastic waste on the quality of pyrolysis oil as an asphalt solvent alternative Natural asphalt cannot be used directly because of hardness and low penetration, so it needs to be softened with a solvent. A solvent that can be used is from oil plastic pyrolysis as an alternative additive. Plastics are now an inseparable item from daily necessities and are the largest pollutant on the environment. Plastic is a polymer that is difficult to be decomposed, and one way to decompose it is through pyrolysis or thermal cracking. This research studies the quality effect of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics waste on the quantity and quality of oil yield produced through the pyrolysis process in the three reactor outlets. LDPE plastics waste used was distinguished: LDPE-White, LDPE Mixed-plastic, and LDPE Blend-plastic. The results showed that, in the process of plastic pyrolysis LDPE, in addition to affecting the yield of produced oil, the quality of plastic is also influenced by the length of time of pyrolysis. The better the quality of the plastic is, the higher the oil yield and the shorter the pyrolysis times are. LDPE plastic pyrolysis at 250 °C produces the maximum yield. Most oil yields, namely 99.78%, 75.60%, and 50.29% were produced by LDPE white plastics, mixed plastics, and blend plastics, respectively, when pyrolyzed for 110, 180, and 270 min. The economic yields of each plastic of 88.78%, 60.68%, and 40.35% were generated if each was hydrolyzed for 60, and 80 min.
