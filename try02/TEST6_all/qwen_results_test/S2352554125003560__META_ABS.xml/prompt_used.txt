You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-production of furfural, reducing sugars and xylooligosaccharides from biomass through the pretreatment with mixture of deep eutectic solvent Dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide:Lactic acid and γ-valerolactone Given the growing demand for biobased chemicals in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetic industries, the development of greener catalytic systems for biomass decomposition and valorization has become a key focus in recent years. This study presents a novel DTAB:LA DES/GVL catalytic system for the co-production of furfural, xylooligosaccharides (XOSs), and enzymatic sugars from biomass. Under optimized conditions (170 °C, 25 min), the DES/GVL (5:5) medium containing 100 mM AlCl3 catalyzed the conversion of rice husk into furfural and XOSs. The resulting residue was subsequently subjected to enzymatic saccharification, yielding reducing sugars and enabling the co-production of furfural, XOSs, and reducing sugars via efficient catalysis. This research provides a green, stable, and sustainable system that promotes the conversion of rice husk into value-added chemicals, offering new insights for developing economical and environmentally friendly biomass refineries. Overall, this approach could be effectively applied to biomass pretreatment, supporting the advancement of the biomass refining industry.
