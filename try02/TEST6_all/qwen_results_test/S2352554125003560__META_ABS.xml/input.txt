Co-production of furfural, reducing sugars and xylooligosaccharides from biomass through the pretreatment with mixture of deep eutectic solvent Dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide:Lactic acid and γ-valerolactone Given the growing demand for biobased chemicals in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetic industries, the development of greener catalytic systems for biomass decomposition and valorization has become a key focus in recent years. This study presents a novel DTAB:LA DES/GVL catalytic system for the co-production of furfural, xylooligosaccharides (XOSs), and enzymatic sugars from biomass. Under optimized conditions (170 °C, 25 min), the DES/GVL (5:5) medium containing 100 mM AlCl3 catalyzed the conversion of rice husk into furfural and XOSs. The resulting residue was subsequently subjected to enzymatic saccharification, yielding reducing sugars and enabling the co-production of furfural, XOSs, and reducing sugars via efficient catalysis. This research provides a green, stable, and sustainable system that promotes the conversion of rice husk into value-added chemicals, offering new insights for developing economical and environmentally friendly biomass refineries. Overall, this approach could be effectively applied to biomass pretreatment, supporting the advancement of the biomass refining industry.
