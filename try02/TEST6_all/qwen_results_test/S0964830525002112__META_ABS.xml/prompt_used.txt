You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimized deep eutectic solvent cocktail assisted sequential pretreatment to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis of Arachis hypogaea L biomass Roadblock in lignocellulose degradation via enzymatic hydrolysis is critical concern to be addressed to improve the biofuel circular economy. Sequential pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis leverages high sugar yields from lignocellulose biomass (LCB) through lignin removal and enhanced enzyme adsorption, outperforming single pretreatment methods. However, the biofuel sector continues the search for alternative greenness pretreatment techniques that combine versatile, cost effective, and environmental sustainability. This study introduces an innovative, eco-friendly synergistic pretreatment method utilising a deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixture of choline chloride, tannic acid, and glucose (ChCl: TA: Glu), together with optimized microwave irradiation (MWI) and ultrasonication, to enhance enzyme hydrolysis of groundnut shell (GNS) into fermentable sugars. Meanwhile, crucial parameters influencing ternary DES treatment - pH 6.2, temperature 65 °C, time 4.2 h and biomass loading 12 % - were predicted by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to enhance LCB hydrolysis before microwave and ultrasonic processing. MWI power and ultrasonic frequency were optimized via the One Variable At a Time (OVAT) approach, finding 300W and 50Hz as optimal for sequential treatment to minimize energy consumption and complexity. Under optimized configurations, this sequential DES-based treatment accomplished significant delignification and hemicellulose removal, resulting in the liberation of 92.89 % cellulose and improved enzymatic saccharification. RSM optimization shown substantial enhancements in sugar release, with cellulose and glucose yield escalating by 5.7 times and 17.22 times (248 mg), respectively from 1 % pretreated sample and yielded bioethanol 12.4g/100g of raw biomass. Structural transformations in GNS were validated by FTIR,XRD, SEM, TEM, DLS, EDAZ, and TGA studies.
