Optimized deep eutectic solvent cocktail assisted sequential pretreatment to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis of Arachis hypogaea L biomass Roadblock in lignocellulose degradation via enzymatic hydrolysis is critical concern to be addressed to improve the biofuel circular economy. Sequential pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis leverages high sugar yields from lignocellulose biomass (LCB) through lignin removal and enhanced enzyme adsorption, outperforming single pretreatment methods. However, the biofuel sector continues the search for alternative greenness pretreatment techniques that combine versatile, cost effective, and environmental sustainability. This study introduces an innovative, eco-friendly synergistic pretreatment method utilising a deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixture of choline chloride, tannic acid, and glucose (ChCl: TA: Glu), together with optimized microwave irradiation (MWI) and ultrasonication, to enhance enzyme hydrolysis of groundnut shell (GNS) into fermentable sugars. Meanwhile, crucial parameters influencing ternary DES treatment - pH 6.2, temperature 65 °C, time 4.2 h and biomass loading 12 % - were predicted by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to enhance LCB hydrolysis before microwave and ultrasonic processing. MWI power and ultrasonic frequency were optimized via the One Variable At a Time (OVAT) approach, finding 300W and 50Hz as optimal for sequential treatment to minimize energy consumption and complexity. Under optimized configurations, this sequential DES-based treatment accomplished significant delignification and hemicellulose removal, resulting in the liberation of 92.89 % cellulose and improved enzymatic saccharification. RSM optimization shown substantial enhancements in sugar release, with cellulose and glucose yield escalating by 5.7 times and 17.22 times (248 mg), respectively from 1 % pretreated sample and yielded bioethanol 12.4g/100g of raw biomass. Structural transformations in GNS were validated by FTIR,XRD, SEM, TEM, DLS, EDAZ, and TGA studies.
