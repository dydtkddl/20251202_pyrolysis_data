Designing PANI/g-C₃N₄/Cr₂O₃ composites for integrated environmental and dielectric functionalities Despite significant progress in the development of multifunctional materials, current research focuses on optimizing, designing, and engineering the materials that can simultaneously exhibit multiple desirable properties (photo degradation and dielectric) without compromising overall performance. In this regard, PANI/graphitic carbon nitride/Chromium oxide (PANI/g-C3N4/Cr2O3), ternary composites were synthesized by the in situ polymerization method and explored their dye degradation property against Brilliant Green, along with dielectric properties. Samples were characterised by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to confirm materials' structural and morphological properties. PANI, PANI/g-C3N4, PANI/Cr2O3, and PANI/g-C3N4/Cr2O3 materials showed a degradation of 70.2 %, 84.4 %, 80.8 %, and 94.3 %, respectively against BG in UV light of 300-Watt. An excellent dye degradation property by ternary composite is attributed to synergistic effect and the lower recombination rate as confirmed by Photoluminescence (PL) spectra. H + and O2- are identified as the major reactive species by performing the scavenger studies, and a probable degradation mechanism has been reported. All the samples obeyed Jonscher’s power law of AC conductivity due to the presence of disorderness with exponent values ranging from 0.65 to 0.95 (less than 1) Dielectric properties of the samples depicted non-Debye-type behaviour. From the Nyquist plots, equivalent electrical networks and charge transfer resistances have been calculated. These results conclude that the synthesized materials are technologically important for photo-degradation and electronic devices.
