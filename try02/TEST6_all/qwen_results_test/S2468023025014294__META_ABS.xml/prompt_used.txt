You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Designing PANI/g-C₃N₄/Cr₂O₃ composites for integrated environmental and dielectric functionalities Despite significant progress in the development of multifunctional materials, current research focuses on optimizing, designing, and engineering the materials that can simultaneously exhibit multiple desirable properties (photo degradation and dielectric) without compromising overall performance. In this regard, PANI/graphitic carbon nitride/Chromium oxide (PANI/g-C3N4/Cr2O3), ternary composites were synthesized by the in situ polymerization method and explored their dye degradation property against Brilliant Green, along with dielectric properties. Samples were characterised by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to confirm materials' structural and morphological properties. PANI, PANI/g-C3N4, PANI/Cr2O3, and PANI/g-C3N4/Cr2O3 materials showed a degradation of 70.2 %, 84.4 %, 80.8 %, and 94.3 %, respectively against BG in UV light of 300-Watt. An excellent dye degradation property by ternary composite is attributed to synergistic effect and the lower recombination rate as confirmed by Photoluminescence (PL) spectra. H + and O2- are identified as the major reactive species by performing the scavenger studies, and a probable degradation mechanism has been reported. All the samples obeyed Jonscher’s power law of AC conductivity due to the presence of disorderness with exponent values ranging from 0.65 to 0.95 (less than 1) Dielectric properties of the samples depicted non-Debye-type behaviour. From the Nyquist plots, equivalent electrical networks and charge transfer resistances have been calculated. These results conclude that the synthesized materials are technologically important for photo-degradation and electronic devices.
