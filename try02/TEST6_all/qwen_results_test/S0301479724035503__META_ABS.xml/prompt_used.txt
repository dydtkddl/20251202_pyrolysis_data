You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A strategic recovery of value-added monomer from polycarbonate waste through catalytic pyrolysis on ultra-high porous MgO The huge generation of plastic waste has become significant environmental problem. For environmentally sustainable plastic waste management, thermochemical recycling of widely used plastic waste such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate have vigorously studied. However, development of proper recycling process for other types of plastic waste is required. In this study, a thermo-catalytic treatment was applied for recovery of value-added monomers and gaseous products from polycarbonate (PC). The systematic study investigating the relationships between pyrolysis conditions (temperature, atmospheric gas, the presence of catalyst) and yield of value-added products was performed. To make the thermochemical process environmentally benign and more efficient, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as an atmospheric gas in comparing to inert gas (N2). When CO2 was introduced, the yield of PC monomer, bisphenol A (BPA), was nearly doubled at 600 °C. At higher temperature, BPA yield decreased with the increased yield of gaseous products. Because CO2 was the major gaseous product, BPA recovery from the PC pyrolysis was the useful approach in PC disposal practice. To improve BPA yield from PC pyrolysis, two MgO catalysts were utilized (medium porosity MgO-1 and ultrahigh porosity MgO-2). Catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 environment increased BPA yield from 12.8 (pyrolysis without catalyst under N2) to 25.6 (MgO-1) and 30.5 wt% (MgO-2) at 600 °C. High porosity MgO catalyst was more effective in BPA production, and the catalyst deactivation was not shown for 4 consecutive reactions. This study informs that MgO catalyst and CO2 flow gas more than doubled the BPA yield from pyrolysis of PC in reference to conventional pyrolysis system (non-catalytic under N2).
