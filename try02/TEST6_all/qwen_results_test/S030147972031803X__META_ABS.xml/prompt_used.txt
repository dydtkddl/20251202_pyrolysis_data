You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrochar obtained with by-products from the sugarcane industry: Molecular features and effects of extracts on maize seed germination Sugarcane bagasse, vinasse and a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and vinasse were hydrothermally carbonized (HTC), with and without the addition of phosphoric acid, in order to propose new applications of sucroenergetic industry by-products on soil. Detailed information on the composition and properties of hydrochars has been obtained through elemental composition, thermogravimetric analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance and, thermochemolysis GC-MS. The soluble acidic fraction from the hydrochar samples were applied to maize seeds to evaluate the agronomic potential as biostimulants and relate the molecular features with maize seed germination. The HTC treatment converted polysaccharide-based biomasses into hydrochars with hydrophobic characteristics (C-Aryl and C-Akyl). Furthermore, the addition of phosphoric acid further increased the overall hydrophobicity and shifted the thermal degradation of the hydrochars to higher temperatures. Biomass influenced the hydrochars that formed, in which the molecular features of sugarcane bagasse determined the formation of more polar hydrochar, due to the preservation of lignin and phenolic components. Meanwhile, the HTC of vinasse resulted in a more hydrophobic product with an enrichment of condensed and recalcitrant organic fractions. The germination assay showed that polar structures of bagasse may play a role in improving the maize seeds germination rate (increase of ~11%), while the hydrophobic domains showed negative effects. The responses obtained in germination seems to be related to the molecular characteristics that organic extracts can present in solution.
