You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physicochemical changes of rice straw after lime pretreatment and mesophilic dry digestion A better understanding of the physicochemical properties of the material, its changes and the effects of anaerobic digestion, will help to improve methane production efficiency. The physicochemical changes of rice straw after solid-state lime pretreatment and dry digestion were investigated. Those changes were revealed by the composition of the substrate before any treatment, from samples of the material during the process and by the final product. Such compositions were studied with X-ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyzes. The obtained results showed that low mass transfer limited the lignin modification and polysaccharide decomposition, resulted in a low biogas yield; and that after pretreatment and 60 days of mesophilic dry digestion, the concentration of cellulose decreased (23.4%) as well as hemicellulose (13.1%). In the opposite case, the concentration of lignin increased (59%) as well as ash (108%). The crystallinity index increased by 5.4% after pretreatment and decreased by 4.8% after digestion. The FTIR spectrogram of the raw sample included a peak reflecting absorption of ester linkages. This peak was absent from FTIR spectra of pretreated and digested samples, indicating that such linkages are broken during pretreatment and then digested by the microorganisms during the anaerobic fermentation. Furthermore, lime pretreatment and dry digestion significantly changed the decomposed profiles and rate, the distribution of pyrolysis product. The obtained data showed that polysaccharides and lignin were decomposed during pretreatment and digestion phases, leading to changes in structural and thermal properties.
