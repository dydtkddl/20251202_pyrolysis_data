You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of recent research on the use of cellulosic fibres, their fibre fabric reinforced cementitious, geo-polymer and polymer composites in civil engineering Environmentally-friendly monofilament cellulosic fibres have been widely used as alternatives for conventional steel reinforcement within concrete. Recently, the use of cellulosic fibre fabrics and their fabric reinforced polymer composites as reinforcement materials within and/or outside of construction materials (e.g. concrete) has gained popularity due to their inexpensive cost and favourable specific mechanical properties compared with synthetic fibre fabrics (e.g. E-glass). This review presents a summary of recent development on cellulosic fibre Fabric Reinforced Cementitious (FRC) and Fabric Reinforced Geopolymer (FRG) composites, as well as their cellulosic Fabric Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites as reinforcements of concrete, masonry and timber structures for civil engineering applications. This review covers: (1) properties (i.e. chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical properties and cost) of monofilament cellulosic fibres and their comparison with synthetic fibres, the relationship between fibre chemical composition and fibre mechanical properties, parameters affect fibre properties; (2) properties (e.g. fabrication of monofilament fibres to fabrics and structures) of cellulosic fibre fabrics, properties of polymer matrices, and properties (i.e. flexural, tensile, impact, insulation and fire properties) of cellulosic fabric FRP composites; and (3) properties (compressive, flexural and tensile and impact properties) of cellulosic FRC and FRG composites, and the properties of cellulosic FRP composites reinforced concrete, masonry and timber structures. In addition, the degradation mechanisms of cellulosic FRC and FRP are discussed. Furthermore, the durability of FRC, FRG and FRP composites are reviewed and the methods to improve the durability of FRC, FRG and FRP composites from the aspects of fibre modification and matrix modification are reviewed and summarized.
