You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of dedicated bioenergy crops grown on reclaimed mine land in West Virginia Dedicated bioenergy crops grown on marginal lands such as reclaimed mine lands and other non-arable lands are auspicious cellulosic sources for sustainable bioenergy production. In this study, characterization of pyrolysis products were documented for two dedicated bioenergy crops grown on reclaimed coal-mine lands in West Virginia. Two clonal varieties (Private and Public varieties) of Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and two varieties (Bomaster and Kanlow varieties) of Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) were used in this study. The oven-dried samples were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed batch reactor under an inert condition and at a temperature of 500°C to produce biochar and bio-oil (vapor condensate). The pyrolysis product, energy and carbon conversion yields were calculated. Additionally, biochar and bio-oil were characterized for elemental composition, volatile, ash and calorific values. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the biochar yields (about 30.00% yield) obtained from the clonal varieties of Switchgrass and Miscanthus. The bio-oil yields were in the range of 45.00–51.00% with the Miscanthus (Private variety) having the highest bio-oil yield of 50.61%. The carbon content of the biomass, biochar and bio-oil were found to be 46.80–48.02%, 77.72–80.23% and 54.68–59.68%, respectively. Average calorific values were found to be 19.49MJ/kg, 29.01MJ/kg and 24.98MJ/kg for the biomass, biochar and bio-oil, respectively. Results for the surface chemistry of the biochars showed carbon and oxygen to be the major chemical constituents of the surfaces of the biochars. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were found to be the major components of the non-condensable gas and the CO:CO2 ratio showed that the non-condensable gas cannot be used as a fluidizing medium.
