You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D printing of gadolinium oxide structure neutron absorber The exceptional proprieties of gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) enable wide applications as sensitized fluorescent material, optical additive, and especially neutron absorber material for nuclear industry or nuclear medicine. Herein, to address the challenge of manufacturing custom-designed Gd2O3 structures, we propose a new approach to fabricating the Gd2O3 structure by vat photopolymerization 3D printing. The preparation of printing feedstock, photo-curing parameters and post-processing were investigated thoughtfully. It was found that the printing feedstock was a typical non-Newtonian fluid. The optimal machine light intensity and exposure time were 6 (∼977 μW / cm 2 ) and 3 s, respectively. After being sintered at 1600 °C for 2 h, the resulting sample reached a density of 58%, a bending stress of 40 MPa, and a flexural elastic modulus of and 20.219 GPa. The successful manufacturing of pure Gd2O3 was further evidenced by the SEM results and XRD pattern. The phase transition of Gd2O3 from cubic to monoclinic occurred around 1400 °C, leading to significant densification. Finally, a green mesh structure with a length of 10 cm was prepared, demonstrating the practical application potential in the neutron absorption and shielding.
