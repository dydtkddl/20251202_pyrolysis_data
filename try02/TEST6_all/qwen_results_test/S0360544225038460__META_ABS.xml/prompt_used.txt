You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene for hydrogen Production: Mechanistic investigation by ReaxFF MD simulation and experiment validation Hydrogen-rich polyolefins are ideal candidates for producing hydrogen and value-added carbon materials. Challenges with conventional pyrolysis of plastics include slow heating, incomplete decomposition, and high energy consumption. Microwave-assisted catalysis is a promising technology to tackle aforementioned problems, thus promoting effective and selective plastic decomposition. However, the underlying mechanisms of positive effects with microwave heating are not fully understood and cannot be easily revealed by experiments. Given such condition, the current study adopted ReaxFF MD method to simulate PE decomposition in conventional, conventional catalytic, and microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis. Shifting the strategy from conventional to microwave heating changed the decomposition pathways of PE from two-step pyrolysis-reforming to one-step C-H bond dissociation. The reaction mechanism of microwave-catalyzed pyrolysis to produce hydrogen was revealed by identifying the key intermediate as C-Fe-H covalent bond. Kinetic analysis showed that activation energies with C-H bond dissociation decreased by 27 kJ/mol with microwave heating, and the increase of catalyst loading could facilitate carbon deposition and hydrogen production. The simulation results were verified by microwave and conventional pyrolysis experiments. It was found both the yields and selectivity of hydrogen with microwave pyrolysis were significantly higher. The results provide insightful understanding of reaction mechanism with microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis.
