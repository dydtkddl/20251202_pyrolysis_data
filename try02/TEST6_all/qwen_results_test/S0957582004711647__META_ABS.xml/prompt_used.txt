You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic Model of the Chemical Recycling of Waste Polyethylene into Fuels Tertiary recycling methods offer potential possibilities for the utilization of waste plastics. Thermal and catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene wastes were studied in a batch reactor under mild cracking conditions to derive liquid cracking products of olefins and paraffins. Zeolite catalysts with different activities were studied: a commercial equilibrium FCC catalyst, an H form ZSM-5 catalyst, and a natural clinoptilolite containing rhyolite tuff. The catalytic processes could convert waste polymers into valuable hydrocarbons. The properties of products could be modified by the use of catalysts. The olefin content and the position of the olefinic double bonds were investigated with IR spectrometry. In the presence of catalysts the olefin content increased, and the terminal bonds migrated into internal positions. Furthermore the liquid products had lower average molecular weights than those obtained without catalysts. The activation energies of the cracking reactions with or without catalysts were determined. The apparent activation energy was lower in catalytic than that in thermal degradation. The cracking reaction rates were modelled and the reaction rate constant of each hydrocarbon type was calculated. The model gives a good approximation of the experimental results obtained from the degradation of LDPE waste in the presence and absence of catalysts. Under the studied parameters, liquids were formed with suitable properties for further uses (e.g. low sulphur content, low pour point).
