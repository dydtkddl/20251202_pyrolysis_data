You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of solar dish applications: thermal utilization, thermochemistry, polygeneration and multi-energy complementary systems Solar dish systems (SDS) offer unique advantages in flexible deployment and high-temperature thermal energy output, playing a critical role in diversified solar energy applications, particularly within distributed energy systems. However, technological bottlenecks continue to hinder their maturation, necessitating expanded research and implementation efforts. This review comprehensively evaluates SDS application frameworks, encompassing thermal power generation, direct thermal utilization, thermochemical conversion, and polygeneration/multi-energy complementary systems. Through comparative analysis, novel implementation pathways and research priorities are proposed to address current application barriers and accelerate SDS technology developments. Key findings indicate that direct heat utilization should focus on compact small-scale SDS, emphasizing efficiency optimization, cost competitiveness, and improved user accessibility. Solar dish thermochemical applications represent a promising and rapidly evolving field that aligns effectively with the high-temperature capabilities of SDS for efficient energy conversion. Future research priorities must focus on advancing fundamental understanding of thermochemical reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, targeted reactor designs (primarily addressing nonuniform radiative flux/radiation fluctuations and engineering implementation of compact configurations), advanced thermochemical energy storage media development and corresponding research on their heat/mass transfer, and scenario-specific applications. Strategic deployment should prioritize distributed energy system configurations and off-grid applications, where implementations predominantly rely on polygeneration architectures that capitalize on high-temperature thermal supply from solar dish collectors. To address the challenge of source-load uncertainty, effective solutions include multi-energy complementary/cascaded energy storage integration, advanced regulation strategy development, and rational system planning/design. Artificial intelligence offers significant potential to drive these implementation processes critically, providing transformative opportunities for SDS deployment.
