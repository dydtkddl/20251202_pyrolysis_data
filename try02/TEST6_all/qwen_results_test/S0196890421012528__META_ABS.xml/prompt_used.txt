You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic and thermodynamic comparative study of quince bio-waste slow pyrolysis before and after sustainable recovery of pectin compounds This work aims to study and compare the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of pyrolysis of quince waste (QW) and pectin-free quince waste (PFQW) after extraction. The pectin extraction with acid treatment had a yield of 3.2 ± 0.1% (dry basis, db). Pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a macro-TG reactor at three heating rates (5, 10, and 15 °C/min) and temperatures in the range 27–900 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. A better fit of the experimental data was achieved by modeling the reactions by a multi-step mechanism considering three different parallel reactions for thermal decomposition of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin. The results indicated that the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method provided the best R2, MSE, and AAD values. The resulting values of the thermodynamic activation parameters ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS were 53.28–89.36 kJ/mol, 114.54–155.01 kJ/mol, and −0.17–(−0.04) kJ/(mol K) for pyrolysis of QW, and 29.97–90.68 kJ/mol, 99.42–158.86 kJ/mol, and −0.23 – (−0.01) kJ/(mol K) for PFQW. According to bioenergy indicators, PFQW presented good characteristics as a biofuel feedstock due to its high energy density values. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters indicated greater reactivity of PFQW to pyrolysis compared to QW, showing that in addition to obtaining a product with added value, such as pectin, the extraction process generates a solid residue that is easier to treat under a thermochemical platform. The novelty of the paper focuses on the influence of the pretreatment of quince bio-waste (by extracting pectin compounds) on reactivity to pyrolysis, providing valuable kinetic and thermodynamic information.
