You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon-rich bio-oils by catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and plastics based on HZSM-5, MCM-41, and HZSM-5/MCM-41 The catalytic co-pyrolysis processes of biomass components (microcrystalline cellulose (MC), xylan (XY), and alkali lignin (AL)) and plastics (polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS)) were studied using HZSM-5, MCM-41, and HZSM-5/MCM-41. For non-catalytic pyrolysis, the co-pyrolysis of MC and AL with plastics are beneficial for increasing the yield of hydrocarbons. The presence of MC, XY, and AL does not exert significant influences on the distribution of types of pyrolysis products of PP, and the interaction of the three components with PS is conducive to the generation of styrene. The introduction of catalysts can increase the yield of hydrocarbons in the co-pyrolysis products of biomass components and plastics. The combination of MC (52.39 %)/XY (35.77 %), PP, and HZSM-5 is most beneficial for increasing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly due to the synergistic effect between MC/XY-derived oxygenates and PP-derived hydrocarbons through the hydrocarbon pool mechanism, the hydrogen transfer reaction, and the Diels-Alder reaction. For the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and PS, HZSM-5 shows significantly superior selectivity for mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, while HZSM-5/MCM-41 and MCM-41 obviously promote the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The research provides a reference for the preparation of high-quality bio-oils through oriented co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.
