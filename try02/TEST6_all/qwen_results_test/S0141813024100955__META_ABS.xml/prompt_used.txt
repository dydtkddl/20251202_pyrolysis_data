You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Revolutionizing nanozymes: The synthesis, enzyme-mimicking capabilities of carbon dots, and advancements in catalytic mechanisms Nanozymes, a revolutionary category of engineered artificial enzymes based on nanomaterials, have been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of natural enzymes, such as the high cost associated with storage and their fragility. Carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as compelling candidates for various applications due to their versatile properties. Particularly noteworthy are CDs with a range of surface functional groups that exhibit enzyme-like behavior, combining exceptional performance with catalytic capabilities. This review explores the methodologies used for synthesizing CDs with enzyme mimicking capabilities, highlighting potential avenues such as doping and hybrid nanozymes to enhance their catalytic efficacy. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of CDs that mimick the activities of various oxidoreductases-like peroxidase, catalase, oxidase/laccase, and superoxide dismutase-like is provided. The focus is on the in-depth exploration of the mechanisms, advancements and practical applications of each oxidoreductase-like function exhibited by CD nanozymes. Drawing upon these exhaustive summaries and analyses, the review identifies the prevailing challenges that hinder the seamless integration of CDs into real-world applications and offers forward-looking perspectives for future directions.
