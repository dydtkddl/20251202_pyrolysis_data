The survey of key technologies in hydrogen energy storage Hydrogen is believed to be an important energy storage vector to fully exploit the benefit of renewable and sustainable energy. There was a rapid development of hydrogen related technologies in the past decades. This paper provides an overall survey of the key technologies in hydrogen energy storage system, ranging from hydrogen production using both fossil fuels, biomass and electricity generated from renewable power sources, to hydrogen storage in both pressurised gas, liquefied and material-based methods, as well as associated electricity generation technologies using hydrogen. The state-of-the-art and the future development of individual technology is also discussed.
