You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Life cycle assessment of the environmental sustainability of biomass pyrolysis polygeneration with a High-Aspect-Ratio reactor The pyrolysis polygeneration reactor with a high aspect ratio is promising due to its potential to optimize product quality by intensifying gas–solid reactions. A comprehensive understanding of the industrial environmental performance of pyrolysis technology with high-aspect-ratio reactor is of significant value for future development and deployment. In this study, pilot-scale experiments and an environmental assessment were conducted in order to identify optimization directions for a large-scale pyrolysis polygeneration system with high-aspect-ratio reactor. Normalization results indicate that the freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity categories represent the primary contributors (>90 %) to the overall environmental burdens. On the consideration the potential for products substitution and biochar sequestration, the primary environmental benefits derived from the categories of climate change and fossil depletion categories could offset approximately 70 % to 105 % of the environmental burdens, resulting in a positive environmental benefit for the pyrolysis system with high-aspect-ratio reactor. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the increases in temperature and decreases in equivalence ratio have a considerable impact on the enhancement of the system’s overall environmental performance by increasing yield of biochar, which could be returned to the soil and sequestered carbon. The results of this study can provide guidance on the direction of more environmentally sustainable development of large-scale pyrolysis polygeneration with high-aspect-ratio reactor.
