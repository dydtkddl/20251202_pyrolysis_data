Life cycle assessment of the environmental sustainability of biomass pyrolysis polygeneration with a High-Aspect-Ratio reactor The pyrolysis polygeneration reactor with a high aspect ratio is promising due to its potential to optimize product quality by intensifying gas–solid reactions. A comprehensive understanding of the industrial environmental performance of pyrolysis technology with high-aspect-ratio reactor is of significant value for future development and deployment. In this study, pilot-scale experiments and an environmental assessment were conducted in order to identify optimization directions for a large-scale pyrolysis polygeneration system with high-aspect-ratio reactor. Normalization results indicate that the freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity categories represent the primary contributors (>90 %) to the overall environmental burdens. On the consideration the potential for products substitution and biochar sequestration, the primary environmental benefits derived from the categories of climate change and fossil depletion categories could offset approximately 70 % to 105 % of the environmental burdens, resulting in a positive environmental benefit for the pyrolysis system with high-aspect-ratio reactor. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the increases in temperature and decreases in equivalence ratio have a considerable impact on the enhancement of the system’s overall environmental performance by increasing yield of biochar, which could be returned to the soil and sequestered carbon. The results of this study can provide guidance on the direction of more environmentally sustainable development of large-scale pyrolysis polygeneration with high-aspect-ratio reactor.
