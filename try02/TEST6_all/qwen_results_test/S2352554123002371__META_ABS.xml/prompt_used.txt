You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Xylitol: Production strategies with emphasis on biotechnological approach, scale up, and market trends Xylitol, a sugar alcohol that is mostly derived from natural sources such as birch wood, corn cobs, and various plant materials like berries, oats, and mushrooms shows promising potential for use in various fields in the future like medicine, food, and pharmaceuticals. The current review paper focuses on a biotechnological approach that overcomes the limitations of traditional chemical methods for synthesizing xylitol, a sugar alcohol that is commonly used as a sugar substitute. The new methods can save time by utilizing waste byproducts such as lignocellulosic biomass, which can benefit from integrated management of hemicellulose with a high xylose content for xylitol extraction and its cost-effective structural reformulation into value-added products. Improved xylitol production from both wild and genetically modified strains is discussed in the paper. Increases in both xylitol production and its practical applications can be used to foretell the direction of the market. Suggestions were made for increasing xylitol output by altering both the substrate and the processing conditions. Out of the various approaches described in the article, the microbial/biotechnological method was found to be promising for future upscaling in the production of xylitol, which is then followed by fermentation and downstream processing. The future applications of xylitol in relation to market trends are also discussed further.
