You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multiscale mechanistic insight into torrefaction as an efficient pretreatment strategy for upgrading gasification of waste paper To elucidate the multiscale mechanistic effects of torrefaction on the pyrolysis and gasification behavior of waste paper, changes in the macroscopic physicochemical properties, reaction kinetics, and microscopic mechanisms during torrefaction of waste paper were first systematically examined using advanced multiscale characterization techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (¹³C NMR). The impact of torrefaction on tar formation, gasification reactivity, and syngas production from waste paper was then evaluated. Results indicate that torrefaction involves depolymerization, decomposition, and debranching of waste paper, followed by aromatization and cyclization of aliphatic compounds, culminating in condensation into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under severe torrefaction conditions. This process is accompanied by oxygen removal and carbon enrichment. As torrefaction intensity increases, re-condensation and graphitization of waste paper intensify, slightly reducing gasification reactivity. However, carbon enrichment and increased concentrations of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) significantly enhance CO yield, while the pre-removal of volatile matter reduces tar formation. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing torrefaction-coupled pyrolysis and gasification processes for waste paper valorization.
