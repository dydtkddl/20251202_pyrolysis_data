Highly efficient and eco-friendly process for selective recovery of copper from waste printed circuit boards via pyrolysis and ammoniacal solvoleaching This study proposes a process combining pyrolysis and ammoniacal solvoleaching to selectively recover Cu from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). Optimal pyrolysis conditions were determined by investigating parameters such as temperature, heating rate, N2 flow rate, holding time and particle size. Under the conditions: 500 °C temperature, 20 °C/min heating rate, 0.3 L/min N2 flow rate, 10 min time and +9.50 mm particle size, ∼25% of weight loss was obtained. The pyrolyzed mass underwent further physical separation process involving impact crushing, magnetic- and gravity separations to enrich metals into a concentrate. Copper in the resulting concentrate was selectively extracted using a one-stage ammoniacal leaching and solvent extraction process (ammoniacal solvoleaching), employing an oxime-based organic extractant, LIX 84-I with a small volume of NH4OH. Ammoniacal solvoleaching was optimized by considering parameters such as stirring speed, time, LIX 84-I concentration, volume of aqueous ammonia, temperature and pulp density. Under the following conditions: 500 rpm, 0.3/0.3/10 (g/mL/mL) of sample/NH4OH/LIX 84-I (0.8 M), 3 h time and 25 °C temperature, quantitative Cu dissolution was achieved after two-stage solvoleaching. Cu solvoleaching followed the Avrami model, with an activation energy of 28.95 kJ/mol in the temperature range 15–45 °C (298–318 K) for the mixed control mechanism. LIX 84-I could be recycled without loss of extraction performance. Cu concentration was further enriched during stripping stage using H2SO4. A flowsheet for the sustainable metal recovery from WPCBs was developed.
