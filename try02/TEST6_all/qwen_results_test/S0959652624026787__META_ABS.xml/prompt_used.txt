You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient and eco-friendly process for selective recovery of copper from waste printed circuit boards via pyrolysis and ammoniacal solvoleaching This study proposes a process combining pyrolysis and ammoniacal solvoleaching to selectively recover Cu from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). Optimal pyrolysis conditions were determined by investigating parameters such as temperature, heating rate, N2 flow rate, holding time and particle size. Under the conditions: 500 °C temperature, 20 °C/min heating rate, 0.3 L/min N2 flow rate, 10 min time and +9.50 mm particle size, ∼25% of weight loss was obtained. The pyrolyzed mass underwent further physical separation process involving impact crushing, magnetic- and gravity separations to enrich metals into a concentrate. Copper in the resulting concentrate was selectively extracted using a one-stage ammoniacal leaching and solvent extraction process (ammoniacal solvoleaching), employing an oxime-based organic extractant, LIX 84-I with a small volume of NH4OH. Ammoniacal solvoleaching was optimized by considering parameters such as stirring speed, time, LIX 84-I concentration, volume of aqueous ammonia, temperature and pulp density. Under the following conditions: 500 rpm, 0.3/0.3/10 (g/mL/mL) of sample/NH4OH/LIX 84-I (0.8 M), 3 h time and 25 °C temperature, quantitative Cu dissolution was achieved after two-stage solvoleaching. Cu solvoleaching followed the Avrami model, with an activation energy of 28.95 kJ/mol in the temperature range 15–45 °C (298–318 K) for the mixed control mechanism. LIX 84-I could be recycled without loss of extraction performance. Cu concentration was further enriched during stripping stage using H2SO4. A flowsheet for the sustainable metal recovery from WPCBs was developed.
