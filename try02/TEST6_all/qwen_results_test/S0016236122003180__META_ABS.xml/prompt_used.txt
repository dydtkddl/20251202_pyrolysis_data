You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The pyrolysis kinetics and heat exchange performance of biomass hydrocarbon pinane Pinane is a downstream product of turpentine and is the basic raw material for the production of flavor products such as linalool and lauryl alcohol. To better understand the performance of biomass hydrocarbon pinane as endothermic hydrocarbon fuel, the pyrolysis kinetics and heat exchange performance of pinane under different conditions was investigated. The pyrolysis kinetics of pinane was obtained in a batch reactor at the temperature range of 553–603 K, the apparent rate constants at different test temperatures were obtained, along with the corresponding Arrhenius parameters of pre-exponential factor A = 5.7 × 1010 s−1 and apparent activation energy Ea = 173 kJ·mol−1. Compared with other typical model fuels, the pyrolysis of pinane shows higher thermal instability. The regenerative cooling test of pinane at temperatures from 400 to 950 K was further performed. The corresponding heat sink is 2.43 MJ·kg−1 at 898 K, indicating the advantage of pinane in the providing higher heat sink in a relatively low temperature range. The detailed analysis of pyrolysis products indicates that pinane mainly undergoes direct ring-opening isomerization at a relatively low temperature stage, producing a large amount of C10 hydrocarbon products. As the temperature rises, the isomers are further cracked to generate small-carbon-number hydrocarbons, accompanied by the formation of a large amount of gas products. Besides, the morphology and spatial distribution of solid deposits on the inner wall of reaction tube after the heat exchange process were characterized by scanning electron microscope and combustion of carbon method. Furthermore, based on the result of product distribution analysis and quantum calculations, a pyrolysis mechanism of pinane has been proposed.
