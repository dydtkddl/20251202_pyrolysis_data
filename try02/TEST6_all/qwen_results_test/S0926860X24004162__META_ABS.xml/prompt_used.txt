You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Paving the way to transfer hydrogenation of CO2 with bio-derived glycerol over Ni supported zeolite catalysts The CO2 transfer hydrogenation with bio-glycerol over a Ni-zeolite was systematically studied to produce formic and lactic acids. The alkaline hydrothermal reactions without a catalyst and with Ni-zeolite heterogeneous catalyst were explored, focusing on the effects of base types and concentrations, reaction atmosphere and temperature. In alkaline hydrothermal reactions without catalyst, NaOH demonstrated superior performance at 1 M. A Ni/NaZSM-5 catalyst showed astounding performance giving 9.3 mol-L−1-g−1 lactic acid and 6.5 mol-L−1-g−1 formic acid at 250 °C after 2 h. Notably, the zeolite showed resistance to the highly basic conditions of the reaction medium. For the first time, CO2 conversion in aqueous phase was reported addressing the complexity of CO2 solubility. A reaction network was proposed including the diverse glycerol transformations not yet studied for this system. Overall, this study sheds light on the understanding of this complex reaction system and the potential of Ni-supported zeolites for sustainable CO2 utilisation.
