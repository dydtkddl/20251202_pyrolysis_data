You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of oil sludge with polyolefins: Evaluation of different Y zeolites to obtain paraffinic products One of the most hazardous contaminants, and the most significant waste by weight in the oil industry, is crude oil sludge. Oil sludge contains many toxic substances, posing risks to human health and the environment. Co-pyrolysis of petroleum sludge was carried out with polyolefins (HDPE, LDPE and PP) in the presence of different Y zeolites, to investigate the influence of these materials on obtaining a paraffin-rich pyrolytic liquid. Assays were performed in a fixed bed reactor at 450 °C for 15 min. The catalysts used have the same faujasite structure with similar textural properties and different acidity. The different polyolefins and catalysts had representative influences on product yield and composition. GCMS analysis allowed evaluating light (C9-C24) and heavy (≥C25) hydrocarbon fractions as well as detecting the presence of aromatic, paraffinic and cyclic compounds. The presence of polyolefins in oil sludge pyrolysis generated oily products with varied yields and compositions, directly related to the polymeric structure. The CBV720 catalyst allowed obtaining paraffinic products with a reduction of aromatic and cyclic compounds in petroleum sludge pyrolysis tests using linear structural chain polyolefins.
