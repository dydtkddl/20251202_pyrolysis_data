Co-pyrolysis of oil sludge with polyolefins: Evaluation of different Y zeolites to obtain paraffinic products One of the most hazardous contaminants, and the most significant waste by weight in the oil industry, is crude oil sludge. Oil sludge contains many toxic substances, posing risks to human health and the environment. Co-pyrolysis of petroleum sludge was carried out with polyolefins (HDPE, LDPE and PP) in the presence of different Y zeolites, to investigate the influence of these materials on obtaining a paraffin-rich pyrolytic liquid. Assays were performed in a fixed bed reactor at 450 °C for 15 min. The catalysts used have the same faujasite structure with similar textural properties and different acidity. The different polyolefins and catalysts had representative influences on product yield and composition. GCMS analysis allowed evaluating light (C9-C24) and heavy (≥C25) hydrocarbon fractions as well as detecting the presence of aromatic, paraffinic and cyclic compounds. The presence of polyolefins in oil sludge pyrolysis generated oily products with varied yields and compositions, directly related to the polymeric structure. The CBV720 catalyst allowed obtaining paraffinic products with a reduction of aromatic and cyclic compounds in petroleum sludge pyrolysis tests using linear structural chain polyolefins.
