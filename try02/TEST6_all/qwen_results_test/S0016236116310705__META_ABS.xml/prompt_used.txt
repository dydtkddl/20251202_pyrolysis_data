You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal cracking of Athabasca VR and bitumen and their maltene fraction in a closed reactor system Thermal cracking of Athabasca vacuum residue (AVR) and Athabasca bitumen (AB) and their maltene fraction was investigated at 400°C in a closed system, i.e. autoclave. The effect of the following variables on the product yield and the properties of the liquid fraction and its maltene extract was evaluated: residence time, pressure of the reactor unit, stirring, temperature and asphaltenes content of the feedstock. The yield of the different fractions, the total energy consumption, the pressure buildup in the batch reactor and the °API gravity and viscosity of the liquid fraction and its maltene extract were used to evaluate the impact of a given parameter. In addition, high-temperature simulated distillation (HTSD) analysis of the liquid product and gas chromatography (GC) analysis for gas product were performed. The effect of reaction time, mixing and pressure on the yield of toluene insolubles (TI) depended on the presence of asphaltenes in the feedstock. TI yield increased at the expense of the asphaltenic fraction when reaction time, mixing and pressure increased. There is an inverse relationship between the initial asphaltenes content in the feedstock and the overall asphaltenes yield base on the parent feedstock. Moreover, increasing asphaltenes content of the feedstock did not introduce significant changes in the total energy input to the reactor.
