Catalytic methane decomposition on an Fe-catalyst, coated on a novel fleece reactor The future hydrogen economy should use both sustainable feedstock and energy sources. The catalytic reforming of methane offers significant advantages over traditional non-catalytic processes since less energy is needed and CO2 emissions are negligible. Contrary to previous experimental investigations, mostly performed in small-scale fixed or thermogravimetric reactors, the present research performs the CH4 decomposition in a novel reactor, where the active catalyst is directly supported on a sintered metal fiber fleece. This facilitates the operation, and improves the scalability and flexibility. Experiments were carried out at an optimum 700 °C. The long duration CH4 conversion was about 90 % in a single pass, but nearly complete if residual methane is recycled. The H2 yield exceeded 80 %. The produced carbon was batch-wise collected as carbon nanotubes by a pulse-jet blow back. A kinetic analysis determined that the reaction was of the first order, with a reaction rate constant of 0.1 s−1. The surface velocity (SV) depended on the achieved CH4 conversion but a value of 50–75 m3 CH4/h per m2 of catalyst fleece in recommended. Carbon nanotubes were fully characterized and demonstrated to be multi-walled with fiber thickness around 40 nm. Although only at TRL 1 to 2 level, a tentative economic assessment reveals a fair cost of H2 and CNT production.
