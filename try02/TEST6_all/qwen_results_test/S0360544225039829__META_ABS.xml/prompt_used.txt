You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic methane decomposition on an Fe-catalyst, coated on a novel fleece reactor The future hydrogen economy should use both sustainable feedstock and energy sources. The catalytic reforming of methane offers significant advantages over traditional non-catalytic processes since less energy is needed and CO2 emissions are negligible. Contrary to previous experimental investigations, mostly performed in small-scale fixed or thermogravimetric reactors, the present research performs the CH4 decomposition in a novel reactor, where the active catalyst is directly supported on a sintered metal fiber fleece. This facilitates the operation, and improves the scalability and flexibility. Experiments were carried out at an optimum 700 °C. The long duration CH4 conversion was about 90 % in a single pass, but nearly complete if residual methane is recycled. The H2 yield exceeded 80 %. The produced carbon was batch-wise collected as carbon nanotubes by a pulse-jet blow back. A kinetic analysis determined that the reaction was of the first order, with a reaction rate constant of 0.1 s−1. The surface velocity (SV) depended on the achieved CH4 conversion but a value of 50–75 m3 CH4/h per m2 of catalyst fleece in recommended. Carbon nanotubes were fully characterized and demonstrated to be multi-walled with fiber thickness around 40 nm. Although only at TRL 1 to 2 level, a tentative economic assessment reveals a fair cost of H2 and CNT production.
