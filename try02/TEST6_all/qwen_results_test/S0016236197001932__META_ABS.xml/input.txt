High-temperature liquefaction of waste plastics High-temperature liquefaction of commingled post-consumer plastics obtained from the American Plastics Council was studied. The liquefaction reaction was carried out in a tubing bomb micro-reactor with operating temperatures of ∼500°C, hydrogen pressures of ∼790kkPa cold and reaction times of 0–30 min. These high temperatures were used to reduce the residence time required for liquefaction. Reactions were carried out in the absence of catalysts. Total conversion and conversions to asphaltenes, oil, gas and coke were monitored. Total conversion as high as 100% was achieved. Gas yields up to 70% and oil yields as high as 60% were obtained. The kinetics of liquefaction of these waste materials was studied. Maximum yield of liquid product was obtained at ∼500°C and ∼5–10 min reaction time.
