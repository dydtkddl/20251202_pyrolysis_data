Trends in the applications of biochar for the abatement of microplastics in water The extensive use of plastic materials in modern society has led to the pervasive release of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). These plastic particles have infiltrated diverse environmental matrices and biological systems, posing serious risks to ecosystems and human health, including endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, and cardiovascular diseases. In response, global attention has turned towards effective remediation strategies. Among these, biochar, a carbon-rich material derived from biomass, has emerged as a promising solution due to its high surface area, adaptable surface chemistry, cost-effectiveness, and potential to valorise waste. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in the use of pristine and modified biochar for MP remediation from water. It also explores future pathways, including the application of biochar in synergistic technologies integrating photocatalysis, membrane filtration, advanced oxidation processes, constructed wetlands, microbial horizontal gene transfer, and data-driven approaches using machine learning and artificial intelligence. The review aims to enhance understanding of the underlying adsorption mechanisms involved in MP mitigation by biochar, as well as the governing forces, based on the most recent research literature. It identifies key limitations in biochar application and outlines strategic directions to address these challenges. Additionally, it discusses biochar's pivotal role in advancing circular economy principles and promoting environmental sustainability, emphasizing its multifunctionality as both an adsorbent and a soil enhancement material. This comprehensive review not only underscores the urgency of addressing plastic pollution but also positions biochar as a vital and promising component in the development of next-generation remediation technologies, contributing to climate change mitigation and fostering a sustainable planet.
