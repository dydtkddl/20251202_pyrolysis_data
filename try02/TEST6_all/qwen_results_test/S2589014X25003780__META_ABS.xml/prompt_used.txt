You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Trends in the applications of biochar for the abatement of microplastics in water The extensive use of plastic materials in modern society has led to the pervasive release of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs). These plastic particles have infiltrated diverse environmental matrices and biological systems, posing serious risks to ecosystems and human health, including endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, and cardiovascular diseases. In response, global attention has turned towards effective remediation strategies. Among these, biochar, a carbon-rich material derived from biomass, has emerged as a promising solution due to its high surface area, adaptable surface chemistry, cost-effectiveness, and potential to valorise waste. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in the use of pristine and modified biochar for MP remediation from water. It also explores future pathways, including the application of biochar in synergistic technologies integrating photocatalysis, membrane filtration, advanced oxidation processes, constructed wetlands, microbial horizontal gene transfer, and data-driven approaches using machine learning and artificial intelligence. The review aims to enhance understanding of the underlying adsorption mechanisms involved in MP mitigation by biochar, as well as the governing forces, based on the most recent research literature. It identifies key limitations in biochar application and outlines strategic directions to address these challenges. Additionally, it discusses biochar's pivotal role in advancing circular economy principles and promoting environmental sustainability, emphasizing its multifunctionality as both an adsorbent and a soil enhancement material. This comprehensive review not only underscores the urgency of addressing plastic pollution but also positions biochar as a vital and promising component in the development of next-generation remediation technologies, contributing to climate change mitigation and fostering a sustainable planet.
