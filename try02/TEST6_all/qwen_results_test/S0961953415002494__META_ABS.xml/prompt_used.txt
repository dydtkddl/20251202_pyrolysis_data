You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study of wood char gasification kinetics in fluidized beds During gasification two steps take place. The first one is pyrolysis and the second one is gasification of the char that remains back after pyrolysis. The second step is slower than the first one, so this step is the limiting factor in designing fluidized beds. Kinetic data for designing fluidized beds are necessary. The paper describes gravimetric measurements directly applied to fluidized bed with large sample sizes. The samples are char of 6 mm wood pellets and 10–40 mm wood cubes in order to directly measure ”apparent kinetics”. The parameters examined in this paper are particle size, product gases (= hydrogen) in the gasification medium, type of wood and differences in CO2/steam gasification. The results are presented as Arrhenius diagrams and half-value period diagrams. The most important parameters are the temperature and product gases (hydrogen) in the gasification agent. The particle size seems to be less important for large wood particles as the measurements do not show significant differences for gasifying char of wood cubes 10–40 mm. The half-value periods for gasification of char from wood cubes (10 mm - 40 mm) with 100% steam at atmospheric pressure lie between 1000 s at 1023 K and 300 s at 1173 K. For char of 6 mm wood pellets the half-value periods lie between 1900 s at 1023 K and 250 s at 1173 K. The reaction is most likely in pore diffusion regime.
