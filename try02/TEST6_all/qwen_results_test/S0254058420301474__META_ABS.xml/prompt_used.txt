You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of silicon carbide ceramics obtained from porous carbon structure achieved by plant carbonization The aim of this research was to obtain a carbon solid residue by the carbonization process of biomass in an inert atmosphere which, through physical activation and chemical treatment (using TEOS - tetraethyl orthosilicate) would allow creation of highly porous and spatially distinct ordered bio-SiC ceramics. The results of carbonization experiments at several operating temperatures and activation of carbons with multiple-cycle treatments TEOS clearly showed the possibility of obtaining SiC nano-structures, after performing the carbothermal reduction at 1400 °C. The increase in the activation temperature and the duration time starts the development of the SiC particles inside the porous structure. The XRPD analysis showed that the major SiC polytype has cubic SiC (β-SiC) structure and remainder is hexagonal SiC polytypic (α-SiC) structure. It was established that the carbons obtained from carbonization of the Platanus orientalis L. plane tree fruit (PTF) precursor and activated at 850 °C with longer holding times (1 and 2 h) exhibit β-SiC (cubic) nano-wires. A possible nano-wires increment mechanism was suggested. The obtained results represent significant contribution in understanding the process as well as the main characteristics of SiC nano-materials and their possible applications.
