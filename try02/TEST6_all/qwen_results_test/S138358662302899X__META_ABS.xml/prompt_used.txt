You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced 2, 6-dimethylpyrazine removal by catalytic ozonation with legumes biochar: The roles of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups Designing efficient and environmentally friendly catalysts is essential to activating ozonation for wastewater remediation. This study prepared soybean biochar (SB), adzuki beans biochar (AB), and mung beans biochar (MB) catalysts using moldy legumes as precursors. The biochars were characterized to investigate the surface characters’ effect on ozone activation toward 2, 6-dimethylpyrazine (2,6-DMP) degradation. All prepared samples drastically facilitated the degradation more than with sole ozonation. It was found that at pH 7 with 10 mg L−1 catalysts, the removal rates of 5 μM 2,6-DMP were 88.3 %, 90.7 %, and 87.3 % by SB, MB, and AB at 30 min, respectively. The surface-area-normalized reaction rate constants (kobs/SBET) showed that AB exhibited the best catalytic activity with the rate of 1.5 × 10−2 mg·m2·min−1, which is 2.3- and 23.1-fold higher than that of SB and MB, respectively. Further characterization confirmed that oxygen- (C–O/C = O and –OH) and nitrogen-containing groups (pyridine N and pyrrole N) were crucial to the catalytic degradation, as electron transfer was promoted to form more ROS. In addition, the quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed OH, O2 −, and 1O2 as the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO), indicating that 2,6-DMP degradation followed the radical and non-radical oxidation pathways. Overall, this study helped to understand the relationship between surface functional groups and intrinsic activity. It also provided a new direction for utilizing agricultural waste.
