You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of industrial solid waste on the generation of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs and PAHs tuned by waste pseudo-components during engineering co-combustion Co-combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW) with industrial solid waste (ISW) is becoming prevailing. But its effects on generation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) remain unclear, hindering their efficient control. Hence, six batches of engineering incineration tests containing diverse blending types and ratios of ISW were designed in an incinerator of 650 t/d. To target the relationship between complex waste components and contaminants, a pseudo-component matrix model was innovatively incorporated, with nine plastic and biomass pseudo-components quantitatively extracted. Compared to raw MSW incineration, co-combustion generally increased generation of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dl-PCBs in fly ash up to six-fold, with the highest TEQ concentrations of 843 ng/kg and 68.1 ng/kg, respectively, while exerted less impact on generation of 16 PAHs. Among nine pseudo-components, polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and cellulose were identified as the key to generation of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. Combustion of PET and cellulose served to provide benzene derivatives, while PVC contributed more chlorine. Tracking the original waste, blending with waste plastics, polyester textile, artificial leather and paper should be strictly regulated. This study was of significance to optimize co-combustion for source reduction of toxic pollutants.
