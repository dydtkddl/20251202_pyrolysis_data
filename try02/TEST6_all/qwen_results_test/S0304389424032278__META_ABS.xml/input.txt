Effects of industrial solid waste on the generation of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs and PAHs tuned by waste pseudo-components during engineering co-combustion Co-combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW) with industrial solid waste (ISW) is becoming prevailing. But its effects on generation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) remain unclear, hindering their efficient control. Hence, six batches of engineering incineration tests containing diverse blending types and ratios of ISW were designed in an incinerator of 650 t/d. To target the relationship between complex waste components and contaminants, a pseudo-component matrix model was innovatively incorporated, with nine plastic and biomass pseudo-components quantitatively extracted. Compared to raw MSW incineration, co-combustion generally increased generation of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dl-PCBs in fly ash up to six-fold, with the highest TEQ concentrations of 843 ng/kg and 68.1 ng/kg, respectively, while exerted less impact on generation of 16 PAHs. Among nine pseudo-components, polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and cellulose were identified as the key to generation of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. Combustion of PET and cellulose served to provide benzene derivatives, while PVC contributed more chlorine. Tracking the original waste, blending with waste plastics, polyester textile, artificial leather and paper should be strictly regulated. This study was of significance to optimize co-combustion for source reduction of toxic pollutants.
