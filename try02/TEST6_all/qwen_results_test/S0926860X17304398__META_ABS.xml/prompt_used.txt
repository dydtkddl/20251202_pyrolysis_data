You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of guaiacol over different Re active phases supported on CeO2-Al2O3 The effect of Al2O3 modification by CeO2 addition (14wt.% to obtain a maximum monolayer coverage) on the catalytic activity of three supported Re active phases (Re, ReOx and ReSx) for guaiacol conversion was studied. A 10wt.% loading of Re was impregnated into CeO2-Al2O3 support and used to prepare the three rhenium active phases by calcination, reduction or sulfidation steps. The catalysts were characterized by different techniques in order to explain the catalytic behavior of the solids studied. The catalysts were then evaluated in a batch reactor at 300°C and 5MPa of H2. The characterization results showed that the addition of CeO2 modified the acidity of the support as well as the metal-support interaction, and consequently the catalytic activity. In fact, CeO2 addition doubled the activity of Re and ReSx catalysts in comparison to the corresponding γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts. These results were attributed to a higher dispersion of active sites in the case of metallic Re catalyst and higher concentration of non-stoichiometric sulfur species (ReS2-x) in the case of ReSx catalyst. On the other hand, a similar catalytic activity was observed over the two supported ReOx catalysts, indicating that the role of ReOx active phase on guaiacol conversion outweighs structural and surface modification induced by CeO2 addition. In relation to products distribution, it was observed that CeO2 addition enhanced phenol formation and generally led to higher degree of deoxygenation which is most likely related to decrease in acidity.
