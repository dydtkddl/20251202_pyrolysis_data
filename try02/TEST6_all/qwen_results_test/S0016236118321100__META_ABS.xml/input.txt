Pyrolytic behavior of coal-related model compounds connected with C–C bridged linkages by in-situ pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry Coal pyrolysis is generally considered to initiate by cleavage of weak covalent bonds bridged between aromatic rings. The C–C covalent bonds are predominant bridged linkages among the framework of coal, which have a critical influence on coal pyrolysis reaction but lack of direct online observation. Five representative coal-related model compounds containing C–C bridged bonds, polypropylene (PP), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP), polystyrene (PS) and poly-4-vinylphenol, were selected to pyrolyze in an in-situ pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (Py-VUV-PIMS). The soft ionized mass spectral detection can provide product distribution and evolved information of original products and intermediates, which are the key evidence to understand the initiation, recombination and reaction routes during pyrolysis process. Online analysis of pyrolysis reaction was found to be priority with cracking of C–C bond in the five polymer samples, and homologous free radicals and original products, which mainly include monomers, dimers and their alkyl and alkenyl radicals, were detected. The results reveal the cleavage temperature of C–C covalent bond is deeply related to its chemical environment, and obvious conjugation effect and steric effect for the bridged linkage were observed. In addition, the effect of hydrogen bond was also observed during the pyrolysis of model compounds containing hydroxyl groups, and intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding reduced the temperature at which C–C bridged bonds break. The analogous fracture mode and pyrolysis behavior of coal-related model compounds, which are beneficial to understand the reaction route and mechanism of coal pyrolysis, were discussed based on the experimental observations and theoretical calculation.
