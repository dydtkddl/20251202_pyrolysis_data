You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic behavior of coal-related model compounds connected with C–C bridged linkages by in-situ pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry Coal pyrolysis is generally considered to initiate by cleavage of weak covalent bonds bridged between aromatic rings. The C–C covalent bonds are predominant bridged linkages among the framework of coal, which have a critical influence on coal pyrolysis reaction but lack of direct online observation. Five representative coal-related model compounds containing C–C bridged bonds, polypropylene (PP), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP), polystyrene (PS) and poly-4-vinylphenol, were selected to pyrolyze in an in-situ pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (Py-VUV-PIMS). The soft ionized mass spectral detection can provide product distribution and evolved information of original products and intermediates, which are the key evidence to understand the initiation, recombination and reaction routes during pyrolysis process. Online analysis of pyrolysis reaction was found to be priority with cracking of C–C bond in the five polymer samples, and homologous free radicals and original products, which mainly include monomers, dimers and their alkyl and alkenyl radicals, were detected. The results reveal the cleavage temperature of C–C covalent bond is deeply related to its chemical environment, and obvious conjugation effect and steric effect for the bridged linkage were observed. In addition, the effect of hydrogen bond was also observed during the pyrolysis of model compounds containing hydroxyl groups, and intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding reduced the temperature at which C–C bridged bonds break. The analogous fracture mode and pyrolysis behavior of coal-related model compounds, which are beneficial to understand the reaction route and mechanism of coal pyrolysis, were discussed based on the experimental observations and theoretical calculation.
