You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From brewers’ waste to fuel precursors: Catalytic pyrolysis of BSG using CaO and Nb2O5-based catalysts for enhanced hydrocarbon production This study investigates the impact of calcium oxide (CaO) and niobium oxide (Nb2O5) catalysts on the analytical pyrolysis of brewer's spent grain (BSG) at temperatures of 550, 650 and 750 °C. The results demonstrate that CaO and Nb2O5 based catalysts reduced oxygenated compounds and enhanced the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. At 550 °C, the hydrocarbon relative yield increased from 2.4 % under non-catalytic conditions to 18 % with FeCaO catalyst. The inclusion of iron in the catalysts contributed to improved vapor quality and stability, leading to superior hydrocarbon conversion rates. An increase in hydrocarbon production was observed across all catalysts at various pyrolysis temperatures. Regarding oxygenated compounds, catalytic tests at 650 °C and 750 °C resulted in a slight decrease in oxygenate relative yields, with Nb2O5 exhibiting the most significant reduction, dropping from 59 % to 44 % and from 56 % to 40 %, respectively, compared to non-catalytic conditions. Conversely, at 550 °C, the catalyst's impact on oxygenate relative yields was minimal. A comparison between catalytic and non-catalytic tests at 550 °C revealed a reduction in the relative yield of oxygenated compounds with three or more oxygen atoms, from 32 % to below 12 %, while compounds containing one oxygen atom increased from 2 % to 31 % when using FeCaO catalyst. This trend persisted across all catalytic conditions, suggesting partial deoxygenation of oxygenated compounds. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature consistently contributed to deoxygenation across all catalysts. These findings contribute to the advancement of bio-oil production technologies from biomass resources.
