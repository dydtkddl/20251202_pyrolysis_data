You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis in wetland engineering: Carbon sequestration, phosphorus recovery, and structural characterization of willow-based chars with X-ray μ-computed tomography Willows from engineered wetland systems (EWS) offer a sustainable approach to wastewater treatment and biomass production. Our study assesses their potential for nutrient recovery and carbon sequestration using slow pyrolysis (600 °C) and hydrothermal carbonization (250 °C). Here, we propose EWS-pyrochars as a ready-to integrate opportunity for soil amendment, as they exhibit a predominant CO2 release and the absence of harmful compounds in pyrolysis-chromatograms, indicating higher stability than hydrochars. Using sequential P-extractions, we observed a high bioavailability in the willow-woodchips and a significant P-retention in EWS-chars—up to 92 % in pyrochars and near-complete retention in hydrochars, along with a higher labile-P fraction of 21 % in hydrochars than 5 % in pyrochars. Utilizing X-ray-based techniques, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and gas physisorption, we characterized the EWS-chars' structures. We revealed innovative 3D-visualizations, which transcend previous literature by providing insights into the chars' internal porosity and quantifying, for the first time, their carbonaceous structural thickness via a meshing algorithm and the mean Feret diameter. EWS-pyrochars exhibit remarkable aromaticity with a higher concentration of overall sp2 C-atoms at 63 % vs. 43 % in hydrochars. Moreover, unlike hydrochars, which depict occluded porosity, EWS-pyrochars exhibited 92 % water storage-like pores. Although hydrochars indicated lower carbonization and thermal stability than pyrochars, their higher carbon retention (55 vs. 41 % in pyrochar) suggest superior annual benefits—on a 10 ha EWS scale—of 80-tons of carbon sequestration and 334 kg of phosphorus recovery versus 60-tons of carbon and 298 kg of phosphorus with pyrochars. Our findings suggest innovative materials for resource recovery, advancing the engineered wetland systems field, shifting their traditional use, and opening the opportunity for future integration into biorefineries.
