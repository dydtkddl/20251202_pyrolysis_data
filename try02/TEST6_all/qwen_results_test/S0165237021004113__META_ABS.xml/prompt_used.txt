You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene for aviation oil production The recycling and reuse of plastics is getting more and more attention all over the world as there are increasing environmental and energy problems. In this study, aviation oil production from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene plastics was detailed. The yields and components of oils at different microwave absorbent loads (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 g SiC), microwave powers (450, 550, 650, 750, and 850 W), and pyrolysis temperatures (340, 400, 460, 520, and 580 °C) were elaborated for the target of aviation oil production. The results showed that the oil yield improved initially and then declined within the range of 56.00–98.78 wt% when there were increases in the microwave absorbent load, microwave power, or pyrolysis temperature. The highest oil yield (98.78 wt%) in the world was obtained at SiC load of 60 g, microwave power of 650 W, and pyrolysis temperature of 460 °C. The main components of the oils contained monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloalkenes with C8-C16 as the majority (64.794–85.932 area%). The results showed that microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene achieved the highest oil yield in the world, and the oil has the potential to be converted into aviation oil.
