You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polymer/layered silicate nanocomposites by combined intercalative polymerization and melt intercalation: a masterbatch process Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) layered silicate nanocomposites were prepared by combination of intercalative polymerization and melt intercalation. In a first step, high clay content PCL nanocomposites were prepared by in situ polymerization of ε-caprolactone intercalated between selected organo-modified silicate layers. The polymerization was catalyzed with dibutyltin dimethoxide in the presence of montmorillonites, the surface of which were previously exchanged with (functionalized) long alkyl chains ammonium cations. Then, these highly filled PCL nanocomposites were added as masterbatches in commercial PCL and PVC by melt blending. The intercalation of PCL chains within the silicate layers by in situ polymerization proved to be very efficient, leading to the formation of intercalated and/or exfoliated structures depending on the organo-clay. These masterbatches were readily dispersed into the molten PCL and PVC matrices yielding intercalated/exfoliated layered silicate nanocomposites which could not be obtained by melt blending the matrix directly with the same organo-modified clays. The formation of nanocomposites was assessed both by X-ray diffraction and transmission electronic microscopy. Interestingly, this so-called ‘masterbatch’ two-step process allowed for preparing PCL nanocomposites even with non-modified natural clay, i.e. sodium montmorillonite, which showed a material stiffness much higher than the corresponding microcomposites recovered by direct melt intercalation. The thermal stability of PCL nanocomposites as a function of clay content was investigated by thermogravimetry (TGA).
