You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Applications and challenges of modified algal biochar in environmental remediation Algal biochar has demonstrated substantial potential in environmental remediation, attributed to its porous architecture, diverse functional groups, and eco-friendly characteristics. However, its unmodified form has certain limitations regarding adsorption capacity, pollutant selectivity, and stability. Advanced modification strategies—including acid/base activation, metal impregnation, and functional group engineering—have been proven to significantly improve its adsorption performance for pollutants such as heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, or nutrients through mechanisms involving surface complexation, ion exchange, and chemical precipitation. These engineered modifications also improve mechanical strength and chemical resistance, effectively reducing the risks of biochar fragmentation and secondary contamination. Despite the recent advancements in modified algal biochar, challenges remain in large-scale production, long-term stability, and cost-effectiveness. This review systematically examines (1) state-of-the-art modification methodologies, (2) contaminant removal mechanisms under varying environmental conditions, and (3) the technological obstacles hindering practical implementation. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships in engineered biochar systems and offer practical guidelines for optimizing remediation technologies.
