You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emergence of robust carbon quantum dots as nano-tracer for groundwater studies☆ Chemical tracers, both artificial and natural, are the established tools for providing information on groundwater flow characteristics such as groundwater flow velocity and flow direction. Chemicals namely chloride, bromide, iodide, dye tracers (Rhodamine-WT) and radioactive elements (Tritium) are artificial tracers that have been used as injected tracers for hydrogeological studies. However, the use of conventional tracers are often limited due to high diffusion rates and difficulties in estimating very low water flow velocities of the order 0.00001 to 0.001 m/s. Herein, we report the first ever large scale synthesis and testing of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as hydrogeological tracers. CQDs, as they are now popularly termed, are a new class of environmentally friendly and highly fluorescent nanomaterial mainly used for bio-imaging and catalytic applications. In this manuscript, we have used fluorescence emission and surface functionalization of the CQDs as parameters to study flow of water in simulated laboratory columns and in field. The robustness of the CQDs towards environmental factors has been tested. Comparative tracer results suggested that CQDs may be envisaged as nano-tracers for future hydrogeological investigations.
