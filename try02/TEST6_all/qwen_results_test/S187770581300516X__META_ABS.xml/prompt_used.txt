You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal Recycling of Solid Tire Wastes for Alternative Liquid Fuel: The First Commercial Step in Bangladesh The first small scale commercial tire waste pyrolysis plant has been installed by the Radiant Renewable Energy (RRE) Ltd. at Gazipur, Dhaka for reducing liquid fuel crisis in Bangladesh. The plant has two pyrolysis unit, each of them consists of a horizontal axis rotary type batch mode reactor with a recycling capacity of 4.5 tons/run. Solid tire wastes in half/whole size are feed into the reactor chamber, operating at 420oC with a light over-pressure of 0.03 bar. The reactor is heated externally by burning product pyrolysis liquids for first three hours and by burning product pyro-gas for rest five hours. The products distribution at optimum reactor operating condition were found oil: 45 wt%, char: 35 wt%, and gases: 10 wt%, in addition to the steel cords: 10 wt% of solid tire waste. The product liquids have been found to have a high gross calorific value (GCV) of around 44 MJ/kg, which would encourage their use as replacements for conventional liquid fuels. Pyrolytic char may be used as a solid fuel, activated carbon, priters ink etc. Pyrolysis gas contains high concentrations of methane, ethane, butadiene and other hydrocarbon gases with a GCV of approximately 37 MJ/m3, a value sufficient to provide the energy required by the tire pyrolysis process. However, the presented plant should be followed some recommended pionts for better operation and its further extension, and also for our sincere corner to safe environment. The plant can be run only under continuous monitoring and consultancy support of a tire pyrolysis specialist team because of new technology and waste material concern.
