You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel systematic multi-objective optimization to achieve high-efficiency and low-emission waste polymeric foam gasification using response surface methodology and TOPSIS method Gasification is one of the most important thermochemical processes to convert a solid fuel to energy carriers of a gaseous product called syngas. This process has been well addressed in the literature for biomass and several valuable researches have been performed on plastic waste gasification. However, it is the first effort for a systematic comprehensive investigation and multi-objective optimization of gasification process for waste polymeric foams using response surface methodology and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) approach. Air and steam waste rigid polyurethane foam gasifications were modeled using coupled method of Gibbs minimization free energy and Lagrange method of undetermined multipliers, and then, validated. Effects of key features consisting gasification temperature and moisture content in both air and steam gasification types and equivalence ratio in air and steam to waste foam ratio in steam types were thoroughly studied on gas composition and energy and hydrogen efficiencies. Analysis of variance was employed for recognizing the most effective parameters on air and steam gasification performances. The results revealed that hydrogen and energy efficiencies of air gasification at multi-objective optimum conditions were 42.68 % and 89.58 %, respectively, and these values were 64.02 % and 96.52 % for steam gasification type. Air gasification of waste rigid polyurethane foam produced 3.13 g of CO2 emission at optimum state; however, its value was 10.02 g for steam gasification type. A multi-criteria decision analysis based on TOPSIS method was utilized for selecting the best gasification type in different scenarios and the findings indicated that air gasification had better performance compared to steam type due to its low emissions.
