You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Disease suppressiveness of agricultural greenwaste composts as related to chemical and bio-based properties shaped by different on-farm composting methods On-farm composting is suitable to recycle agricultural biomasses in mature and stable organic matter that can be applied to improve the general soil conditions, such as physical, chemical, hydro-physical, texture, and refresh the provided ecosystem services for human well-being. Quality compost have a high potential in sustaining plant health through disease suppressiveness mechanisms against soil-borne pathologies; however, this property needs to be standardized. In this work, leafy vegetable/chipped energy cardoon residues have used as common starting feedstock in three comparative composting piles differentiated for the aeration method (passive, active and manual turning). Compost from both passively and actively aerated static piles showed higher suppressive properties against Lepidium sativum damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia minor. The enhanced suppressiveness was found associated to increased population levels of fungi and bacteria, combined with larger microbial activity and catabolic diversity. Compost community levels of physiological profiles were distributed within PCA biplots according to the gradient of suppressiveness and, putatively, their C-food bioavailability degree. The observed differences in stimulation and selection of microbiota may be related to specific molecular compost features. The two suppressive compost revealed either a distinct lipid composition, assessed by thermochemolysis and to the preservation of readily biodegradable molecules by lignocellulosic components, as detected in NMR analyses. Findings indicate the relevance of on-farm composting methods in shaping compost suppressive functions and give new information about the provisioning of bio-based products for sustainable plant disease management.
