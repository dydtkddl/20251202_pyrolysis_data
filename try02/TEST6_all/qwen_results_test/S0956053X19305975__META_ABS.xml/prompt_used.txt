You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of hydrothermal co-carbonization of sewage sludge with fruit and agricultural wastes on hydrochar fuel quality and combustion behavior In order to improve fuel quality of sewage sludge, fruit and agricultural wastes have been selected for hydrothermal co-carbonization. After hydrothermal co-carbonization, organics retention was facilitated, while O/C and H/C atomic ratios of hydrochars were substantially upgraded. Particularly, hydrochar from hydrothermal co-carbonization of sewage sludge with peanut shells at mass ratio of 1:3 (denoted as “SS:PS = 1:3”) showed the highest fuel ratio of 0.79 and its carbon content was increased to 50.0% with significantly decreased O/C and H/C atomic ratios. Furthermore, higher heating value of hydrochars from hydrothermal co-carbonization was increased by nearly 2.65-fold and reached 21.72 MJ/kg. Moreover, the most favorable aromatization occurred when sewage sludge and peanut shells blending ratio was 3:1 or 1:1, whereas hydrothermal co-carbonization induced more CO and OH than COOH in hydrochars due to synergistic decarboxylation. A relatively higher value of point of zero charge for hydrochars from hydrothermal co-carbonization implied improved hydrophobicity. Combustion kinetics results indicated that hydrothermal co-carbonization balanced activation energies of hydrochars in devolatilization/combustion stage and char combustion process, rendering a more stable and lasting combustion profile. Hydrochars “SS:PS = 1:3” demonstrated desirable combustion performance. Therefore, hydrothermal co-carbonization can realize sustainable utilization of organic solid wastes towards superior hydrochar solid biofuels.
