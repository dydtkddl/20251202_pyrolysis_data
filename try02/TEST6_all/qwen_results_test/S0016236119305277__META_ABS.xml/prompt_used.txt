You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tri-pyrolysis: A thermo-kinetic characterisation of polyethylene, cornstalk, and anthracite coal using TGA-FTIR analysis The tri-pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE ), cornstalk (CS ) and anthracite coal (AC ) was performed using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The pyrolysis and kinetic characteristics of the raw feed materials (PE, CS and AC ) along with selected mass blend ratios was investigated and compared. The tri-pyrolysis process for the selected mass blend ratios is characterised by three distinct stages, which is sequentially dominated by cornstalk CS , polyethylene PE , and anthracite AC . It was found that the activation energies representing the tri-pyrolysis process are different with respect to the activation energies associated with the individual raw feed materials. It is observed that for any given fixed mass blend ratio of PE as the contribution of CS is increased the initial decomposition temperature at which tri-pyrolysis takes place is significantly lowered to <190 °C. Therefore, the increased addition of CS is considered to enhance the tri-pyrolysis process. An increase in the mass blend ratio of AC resulted in higher yields of pyrolysed residue. The yield of tri-pyrolysed residue accounted for up to 40 wt% when the mass blend contribution of AC was ≥0.5. Activation energies of <130 kJ mol−1 for the suite of mass blended materials was determined with little variation in the actual EA’s between the respective mass blend ratios. The tri-pyrolysis reaction is thought to be more stable than the pyrolysis of the individual raw feed materials and it is further suggested that a synergy between the respective feed materials exists during the tri-pyrolysis process.
