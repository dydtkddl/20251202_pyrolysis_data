You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potentials of palm kernel shell derivatives: a critical review on waste recovery for environmental sustainability Huge quantities of Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) are produced as wastes annually due to increase in demand for palm oil. Regardless of the numerous potential derivatives from the waste PKS such as activated carbon, pulverized shells, liquified fumes etc., there still exists the problem of its indiscriminate disposal or incineration without energy recovery thereby creating both economic and environmental concerns. This review is therefore aimed at presenting the state of the art on the numerous applications of PKS as a carbon–neutral, biodegradable, affordable and available residual component of oil palm processing, which if properly maximized will be a value-added precursor to solving the associated disposal and environmental challenges. Findings from most studies demonstrate that PKS has great potentials as a bioabsorbent, abrasive, detoxifier, antibacteria, antifungi and antioxidant material as well as a biofuel for syngas and biodiesel production. Other applications of PKS include reinforcement for polymer and metallic composites and aggregates in construction and ceramics. Industrial uses of PKS in agriculture, oilrefining, healthcare, fashion, glass, drugs and rubber vulcanizate production were also discussed. The suitability of PKS for other engineering applications were also highlighted with recommendation for further exploitation suggested. This review is expected to provide technical data for both scientists and policy makers in environmental sustainability.
