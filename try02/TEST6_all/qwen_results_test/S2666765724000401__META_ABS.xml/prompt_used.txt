You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste plastic char as adsorbent for removal of pollutants from landfill leachates–A critical review Plastic pollution constitutes a nuisance to the environment. It negatively affects marine life and pollutes soil and groundwater which can lead to serious health impacts. The aim of this paper is to look at recent advances and prospect of utilizing waste plastic char derived by pyrolysis of waste plastic as adsorbent for removing pollutants from landfill leachates. The impacts of waste plastics on aquatic life, tourism, human health, climate, and soil were reviewed and various strategies for waste plastic management were considered. Different classifications of pyrolysis which include thermal, catalytic and microwave – assisted pyrolysis processes with various heating rates: slow/conventional, fast, and flash pyrolysis were reviewed. Previous works carried out by researchers on synthesis of waste plastic char as adsorbent were critically examined. Furthermore, the prospect of using adsorbent synthesized via pyrolysis of waste plastic for removal of pollutants in landfill leachates was investigated. Recommendations on how to derive optimum benefits from the prospect of utilizing adsorbent derived through pyrolysis of waste plastic for removal of pollutants from landfill leachates are presented.
