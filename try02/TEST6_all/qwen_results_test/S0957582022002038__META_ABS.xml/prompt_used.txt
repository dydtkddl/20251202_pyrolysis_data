You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on the heat transfer and product characteristics of waste PCB recycled by a novel pilot-scale pyrolysis furnance Printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a major constituent of the waste electric and electronic equipment, which represents a rapidly growing disposal problem worldwide. In order to achieve large-scale treatment of PCB, this work designed an innovative pilot-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis experiment system and proposed detailed on-site temperature measurements to quantify the impact and the delays of the temperature acceleration process. The large heat absorption of the pyrolysis reaction causes low heat transfer efficiency and significant temperature gradient along the vertical of the polit-scale furnance. Furthermore, X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, gas chromatography–mass spectrometer and ion chromatograph were applied for the analysis of the pyrolysis product characteristics. The proportions of the phenolic compounds are 69.23%, 68.46% and 56.17% corresponding to the temperatures of 350 °C, 450 °C, and 550 °C, respectively. Moreover, the organic bromine in the pyrolysis oil was suppressed by increasing the temperature to 550 °C. The respective contents are 46.02 mg/g, 44.19 mg/g and 38.96 mg/g. The results from this study are useful to provide necessary knowledge for the design and optimisation of the industrial application of PCB pyrolysis devices.
