You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of waste ship-oil sludge into renewable fuel: Assessment of fuel properties and techno-economic viability of supplementing and substituting commercial fuels Waste ship-oil sludge (WSOS) is considered as a hazardous waste as it affects the aquatic and dependent ecosystems. However, energy-rich fuels can be obtained upon treating this waste instead of discharging into the sea. Pyrolysis of oily wastes yields a higher proportion of energy-rich fuel when compared to solid wastes. This study provides an insight into the production of different products at various stages of thermal decomposition of completely mixed WSOS and compares its fuel properties such as calorific value, acid content, flash point, distillation, etc. with commercial diesel and aviation fuels. Non-combustible phenol-rich liquids were obtained at a temperature of 220 °C–300 °C (stage – 1) and 300 °C–400 °C (stage – 2). The stage – 2 product contained octa atomic sulphur and the concentration of sulphur in the subsequent stages increased consequently. Stage 3 (475 °C–550 °C) and stage 4 (550 °C–650 °C) products were analysed for commercial fuel properties and compared to conventional diesel and aviation fuels as they contained 45.79% and 56.29% of diesel-equivalent (C13 – C18) hydrocarbons respectively. Stage 3 corresponded well with Grade No.1 diesel fuel according to the ASTM D-975-19 standards and exhibited better properties in comparison with the stage 4 product. An inductive method of techno-economic analysis was carried out. The analysis returned a positive net present value (69,142.49), a high internal return rate (53.78%), and a payback period of 13.52 months, indicating that the sale of pyrolyzed WSOS as commercial fuel will be profitable.
