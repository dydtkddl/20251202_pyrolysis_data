Dual-control strategy for selective upgrading of polyethylene waste into jet fuel-range alkanes Selective conversion of polyethylene (PE) waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to uncontrolled C–C bond cleavage and broad product distributions. Here, we propose a dual-control strategy that couples thermodynamically decoupled tandem catalysis with rational Ru-based catalyst design to improve carbon efficiency and fuel selectivity. A two-stage pressurized fixed-bed reactor was developed, where PE undergoes high-temperature hydropyrolysis followed by gas-phase hydrogenolysis of olefinic intermediates. Compared with pyrolysis or hydrogenolysis alone (<50 % selectivity to C8–C16 n-alkanes), the optimized 0.5Ru/Co3O4 catalyst delivered 85.1 % selectivity and 72.9 wt% yield of C8–C16 n-alkanes from real PE medical waste, while keeping gas yield below 12 wt%. Unlike conventional Ru catalysts that promote terminal bond cleavage and excessive gas formation, the synergy between small Ru clusters and redox-active Co3O4 favors selective hydrogenation–cleavage cycles at internal C–C bonds, suppressing over-cracking. This energy-efficient route minimizes carbon losses, offers potential scalability for recycling PE waste into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons, and contributes to carbon reduction and the circular economy.
