Catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse using molybdenum modified HZSM-5 zeolite The main objective of the present work is to study the effect of molybdenum (Mo) loading amount on Hydrogen exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5, Si/Al = 23) catalyst on pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse via in-situ fixed bed reactor. HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was used as a support with Mo as promoter modified at varying metal loading (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt.%) via incipient wetness impregnation method. The pyrolysis oil (PO) yields and aromatic hydrocarbons (AHCs) yields were significantly affected by the use of all synthesized catalysts than the none catalytic pyrolysis, in which generating lower PO yields (11.7 wt.%) and AHCs yields (1.1 wt.%). The impregnation of Mo in the framework of HZSM-5 has an additional effect on the performance of the support HZSM-5 catalyst, with respect to PO and AHCs yields. Among all the catalysts tested, Mo(1 wt.%)/HZSM-5 catalyst has demonstrated to be potential candidates in the catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse into a higher yield of ACHs in PO.
