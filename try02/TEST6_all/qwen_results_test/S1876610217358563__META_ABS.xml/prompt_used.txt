You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse using molybdenum modified HZSM-5 zeolite The main objective of the present work is to study the effect of molybdenum (Mo) loading amount on Hydrogen exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5, Si/Al = 23) catalyst on pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse via in-situ fixed bed reactor. HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was used as a support with Mo as promoter modified at varying metal loading (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt.%) via incipient wetness impregnation method. The pyrolysis oil (PO) yields and aromatic hydrocarbons (AHCs) yields were significantly affected by the use of all synthesized catalysts than the none catalytic pyrolysis, in which generating lower PO yields (11.7 wt.%) and AHCs yields (1.1 wt.%). The impregnation of Mo in the framework of HZSM-5 has an additional effect on the performance of the support HZSM-5 catalyst, with respect to PO and AHCs yields. Among all the catalysts tested, Mo(1 wt.%)/HZSM-5 catalyst has demonstrated to be potential candidates in the catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse into a higher yield of ACHs in PO.
