You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impacts of fresh bed materials on alkali release and fuel conversion rate during wood pyrolysis and char gasification Bed materials provide efficient heat transfer and catalytic function in the thermochemical conversion of biomass, but their interactions with the fuel remain incompletely understood. In this study, the effects of bed materials on alkali release and fuel conversion during wood pyrolysis and CO2 gasification are investigated by online alkali detection combined with thermogravimetric analysis. The investigated bed materials include silica, sea sand, alumina and the natural ores olivine, ilmenite and dolomite. Only dolomite has a significant effect on fuel mass loss and alkali release during wood pyrolysis, while all bed materials influence char reactivity and alkali release during gasification. Sea sand, alumina and dolomite enhance the char gasification during the whole or most of the gasification process, which is related to alkali migration from the bed materials. All bed materials affect char reactivity and alkali release when the conversion approaches completion, and small amounts of some bed materials reduce the alkali release by an order of magnitude. The findings can be understood based on the chemical composition of the different materials. Silicon-rich materials reduce the levels of catalytically active alkali by formation of stable alkali silicates, and a similar explanation applies for ilmenite that captures alkali efficiently. Magnesium and calcium in contrast promote alkali release through their influence on alkali silicate chemistry. Analysis of char surfaces using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy indicates that low amounts of several elements are transferred from the bed material to the char where they may be directly involved in the char conversion process. The transferred elements are specific for each bed material and relates to their chemical composition. Mechanisms for material exchange between bed material and char are discussed.
