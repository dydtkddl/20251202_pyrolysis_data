You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-step pyrolysis for waste HDPE valorization Among the implemented strategies for recycling and reutilization of HDPE, pyrolysis process is considered an attractive alternative, because its potential to use waste materials to produce valuable chemical feedstock and high energy content hydrocarbons. Through pyrolysis transformation, plastics are thermally cracked in the absence of oxygen and the reaction parameters can be controlled to favor the production of specific compounds and liquid fractions. During this project, waste HDPE thermal decomposition was evaluated in a range of 450–550 °C, considering samples of 2 mm and 5 mm and a residence time of 30 min. A design of experiments was applied to find the optimal conditions to maximize the volatile fraction. Then the waste HDPE was transformed in a two-step pyrolysis in order to maximize the volatiles fraction and the intermediate and final products analyzed. According to results, A volatile fraction equivalent to the 97 % of HDPE mass was obtained at 500 °C, with a 5 mm particle size and a hold time of 30 min. The chemical analysis of wax and oil products showed that, although both blends are similarly made of alkanes, alkenes, and dienes, the compounds found in oil are shorter-chain and in a greater variety than those found in wax.
