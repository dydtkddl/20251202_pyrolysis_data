You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling the potential of pyrolysis-gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production from biomass and plastic waste The paper highlights the emerging importance of hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy with a focus on biomass and plastic waste feedstocks. The effectiveness of different gasification operations, including co-gasification, pyrolysis-gasification, and co-pyrolysis-gasification in producing hydrogen-rich syngas from biomass and plastic wastes, has been explored. The paper also probes the catalytic characteristics of the process, examining the functions of various metal catalysts, including alkaline earth metallic catalysts, and natural mineral catalysts for enhancing the hydrogen-rich syngas generation. Further, the effect of key operating factors including the synergy in co-gasification reactors, the influence of gasifying agents, temperatures, pretreatment effects, and types of gasification reactors on hydrogen yield and quality were extensively examined. The pyrolysis-gasification of biomass and plastic waste not only solves waste management issues but also creates new opportunities to produce clean energy, which is a major step towards a circular economy. Biomass and plastic waste feedstocks, various types of gasification techniques and their reactions and mechanisms, the effects of catalysts, as well as the effects of other parameters influence the overall hydrogen production during pyrolysis-gasification. The review offered a novel approach to improving the sustainability and efficiency of hydrogen production from waste by incorporating recent advances in reactor design and process optimization. It also identifies future research directions and practical applications.
