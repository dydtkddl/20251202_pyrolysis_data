You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modified HZSM-5 zeolites for intensifying propylene production in the transformation of 1-butene The transformation of 1-butene was studied in order to intensify propylene production on catalysts prepared based on HZSM-5 zeolites of different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio modified as follows: (i) by incorporating K or P (1–5wt.%) and (ii) subject to mild in situ steaming. The effect of zeolite modifications on the catalyst physical and acid properties and on their kinetic performance was analyzed, given that they are two key factors for selectively re-routing oligomerization–cracking reactions to propylene production and for minimizing coke formation. Experiments were carried out under the following operating conditions: 500°C; space time, up to 1.6(g of catalyst)h(mol of CH2)−1; time on stream, 5h. The following criteria were used for assessing catalyst performance: (i) conversion; (ii) product yield and selectivity of each lump of reaction products (CH4, C2H4, C3H6, C2 C3 paraffins, C4H10, C5+ aliphatics and BTX), with the aim of maximizing propylene, and (iii) deactivation by coke deposition. Although catalytic performance was improved by selecting a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, as well as by incorporating 1wt.% P and mild in situ steaming, the incorporation of 1wt.% K was the most effective treatment for maximizing propylene yield and minimizing coke formation, which is explained by the considerable attenuation of the acid strength of the zeolite sites. A steady propylene yield of 30% and a selectivity of 40%, for a conversion of 1-butene higher than 70%, have been obtained with a catalyst prepared by agglomerating (with bentonite and alumina) 1wt.% K modified HZSM-5 zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 =280.
