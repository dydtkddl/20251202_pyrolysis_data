You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) as emerging pollutant in ground water: Environmental impact, potential risks, limitations and way forward towards sustainable management Plastics play an indispensable role in our daily lives, owing to their ease in use, low cost, strength, versatility and durability but their excessive usage in packaging industries, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and other sectors has caused severe environmental damages, raising serious concerns. Plastics’ (primary and secondary) fragmentation results in the formation of micro-and nano-plastics (MNPs). MNPs, once disposed in the environment, persist there for long duration due to their extremely poor degradability. MNPs may act as a carrier for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), thus raising environmental and human health complications. House-hold activities, improper municipal solid waste management, anthropogenic waste, and agricultural run-off, etc. are among the several aspects responsible for the accumulation of MNPs in the soil or in waterways (lakes, rivers, and finally sea). Terrestrial contamination leads groundwater contamination with leachates, causing harmful ecotoxicological impact on the rhizosphere, microbiota and plants. The current review aims to elucidate the major sources and pathways responsible for the emergence of MNPs in groundwater, ecotoxicity and human health hazards. Novel hybrid technologies that are conducive for the characterization and mitigation of MNPs have also been discussed. Furthermore, special emphasis has been laid upon the valorization of plastic wastes as a way forward for circular bioeconomy and to attain the sustainable development goals by 2030. For management of plastic waste, it is highly recommended to find sustainable alternate material and to adopt policies that regulates its usage, and suggests measures such as recycling and regeneration.
