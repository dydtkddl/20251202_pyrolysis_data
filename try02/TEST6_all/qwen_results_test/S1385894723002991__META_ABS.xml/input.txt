Micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) as emerging pollutant in ground water: Environmental impact, potential risks, limitations and way forward towards sustainable management Plastics play an indispensable role in our daily lives, owing to their ease in use, low cost, strength, versatility and durability but their excessive usage in packaging industries, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and other sectors has caused severe environmental damages, raising serious concerns. Plastics’ (primary and secondary) fragmentation results in the formation of micro-and nano-plastics (MNPs). MNPs, once disposed in the environment, persist there for long duration due to their extremely poor degradability. MNPs may act as a carrier for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), thus raising environmental and human health complications. House-hold activities, improper municipal solid waste management, anthropogenic waste, and agricultural run-off, etc. are among the several aspects responsible for the accumulation of MNPs in the soil or in waterways (lakes, rivers, and finally sea). Terrestrial contamination leads groundwater contamination with leachates, causing harmful ecotoxicological impact on the rhizosphere, microbiota and plants. The current review aims to elucidate the major sources and pathways responsible for the emergence of MNPs in groundwater, ecotoxicity and human health hazards. Novel hybrid technologies that are conducive for the characterization and mitigation of MNPs have also been discussed. Furthermore, special emphasis has been laid upon the valorization of plastic wastes as a way forward for circular bioeconomy and to attain the sustainable development goals by 2030. For management of plastic waste, it is highly recommended to find sustainable alternate material and to adopt policies that regulates its usage, and suggests measures such as recycling and regeneration.
