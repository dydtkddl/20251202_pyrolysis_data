You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of nafcillin sodium monohydrate from aqueous solution by hydrogels containing nanocellulose: An experimental and theoretical study In the present work, new biocomposite hydrogels were prepared based on the vinyl monomer 2-methacroyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (ClAETA) in the presence of nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) for the removal of the emerging contaminant nafcillin sodium monohydrate (NFX). The hydrogels were synthesized via free radicals, with the amount of CNF varied, and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. The capacity to absorb water and to remove NFX was determined through batch studies. It was observed that the presence of CNF significantly promotes both properties, with a hydration capacity of 2100% and an NFX adsorption capacity of 45 mg g−1 in P(ClAETA)1-12-2%CNF (pH 6, 0.01 g of adsorbent, initial concentration of NFX 200 mg g−1). The conformational study showed that in the most stable conformation, CNF avoids direct interaction with the NFX molecule. Herein, the main interactions are predominantly dominated by weak interactions such as London dispersion and electrostatic interactions between charged groups. Molecular dynamics simulations distinguish the existence of π-π stacking interactions between aromatic rings from NFX in the polymer + NFX system. Contact interactions were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized by the NCI index and the IGM analysis.
