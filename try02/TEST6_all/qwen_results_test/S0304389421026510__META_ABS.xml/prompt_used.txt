You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Occurrence and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from electronic waste dismantling activities: A critical review from environmental pollution to human health Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest-growing solid wastes and has become an urgent issue due to the potential adverse consequences of exposure to emitted toxic pollutants, especially for these occupational exposed workers and local residents. In this review, the environmental occurrences, emission characteristics, sources, and possible adverse effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted from primitive e-waste dismantling activities are summarized. In general, the atmospheric levels of PAHs at typical e-waste sites, e.g., in Guiyu, China, have substantially decreased by more than an order of magnitude compared with levels a decade ago. The PAH concentrations in soil from old e-waste sites in China are also generally lower than those at newly emerged e-waste sites in India, Pakistan and Ghana. However, elevated concentrations of PAHs have been reported in human milk, hair and urine from the populations near these e-waste sites. Source apportionment both from bench-scale studies to field observations has demonstrated that the pyrolysis and combustion processing of electronic circuit board are mainly responsible for the emissions of various PAHs. In addition, some specific PAHs and their derivatives, such as triphenylbenzene, halogenated and oxygenated PAHs, have frequently been identified and could be considered as indicators in routine analysis in addition to the 16 U.S. EPA priority PAHs currently used.
