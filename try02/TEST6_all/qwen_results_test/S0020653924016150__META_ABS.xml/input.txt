Advances of Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles in Dental Implant Applications Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) are becoming increasingly crucial in dental implant applications as they are highly compatible with biological systems, actively support biological processes, and closely resemble bone minerals. This review covers the latest progress in how HANPs are made, studied, and used in dentistry. It looks at critical methods for creating HANPs, such as sol-gel, microwave hydrothermal synthesis, and biomimetic approaches, and how they affect the particles' size, structure, and activity. The green synthesis method illustrated a new door to synthesize HAp for maintaining biocompatibilityand increasing antibacterial properties. The review also explores how HANPs improve the integration of implants with bone, support bone growth, and help treat sensitive teeth based on various laboratory and clinical studies. The usage of HAp in dentin and enamel shows higher potentiality through FTIR, XPS, XRD, EDS, etc., for mechanical stability and biological balance compared to natural teeth. Additionally, the use of HANPs in dental products like toothpaste and mouthwash is discussed, highlighting its potential to help rebuild tooth enamel and fight bacteria. There are some challenges for long-term usage against oral bacteria, but doping with inorganic materials, like Zn, has already solved this periodontal problem. Much more research is still essential to estimate the fabrication variation based on patient problems and characteristics. Still, it has favorable outcomes regarding its bioactive nature and antimicrobial properties. Due to their compatibility with biological tissues and ability to support bone growth, HANPs hold great promise for advancing dental materials and implant technology, potentially leading to better dental care and patient outcomes.
