You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances of Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles in Dental Implant Applications Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) are becoming increasingly crucial in dental implant applications as they are highly compatible with biological systems, actively support biological processes, and closely resemble bone minerals. This review covers the latest progress in how HANPs are made, studied, and used in dentistry. It looks at critical methods for creating HANPs, such as sol-gel, microwave hydrothermal synthesis, and biomimetic approaches, and how they affect the particles' size, structure, and activity. The green synthesis method illustrated a new door to synthesize HAp for maintaining biocompatibilityand increasing antibacterial properties. The review also explores how HANPs improve the integration of implants with bone, support bone growth, and help treat sensitive teeth based on various laboratory and clinical studies. The usage of HAp in dentin and enamel shows higher potentiality through FTIR, XPS, XRD, EDS, etc., for mechanical stability and biological balance compared to natural teeth. Additionally, the use of HANPs in dental products like toothpaste and mouthwash is discussed, highlighting its potential to help rebuild tooth enamel and fight bacteria. There are some challenges for long-term usage against oral bacteria, but doping with inorganic materials, like Zn, has already solved this periodontal problem. Much more research is still essential to estimate the fabrication variation based on patient problems and characteristics. Still, it has favorable outcomes regarding its bioactive nature and antimicrobial properties. Due to their compatibility with biological tissues and ability to support bone growth, HANPs hold great promise for advancing dental materials and implant technology, potentially leading to better dental care and patient outcomes.
