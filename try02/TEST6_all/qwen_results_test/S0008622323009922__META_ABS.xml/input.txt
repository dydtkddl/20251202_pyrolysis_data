Floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FCCVD) for direct spinning of CNT aerogel: A review Despite significant progress in understanding the floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FCCVD) process, for the production of various carbon nanotube (CNT) architectures, achieving consistent desired characteristics remains a challenge. In this review, a detailed parametric analysis has been conducted to provide a discourse on the role of all parameters, including diverse collection strategies and the seldom-discussed aspect of safe gas disposal. The review begins by briefly explaining the FCCVD technique, its mechanism, and its evolution over time. This is followed by a systematic discussion of the various constituting units and subunits needed to establish a FCCVD setup, accompanied by a comprehensive analysis of the process. The final section summarizes the key findings and proposes avenues for further investigation and development for future advancements in the field.
