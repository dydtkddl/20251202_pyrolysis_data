Catalyzed oxidative desulfurization of coal tar pitch with trifluoroacetic acid/choline chloride eutectic solvent To avoid the adverse effects of sulfur in coal tar pitch (CTP) on properties of the prepared carbon materials and environment, organic acids with different acidity and choline chloride (ChCl) were selected to prepare deep eutectic solvents (DES) by low-temperature heating, and H2O2 as the oxidant to compose a catalytic oxidation-extraction desulfurization system of CTP. The effects of DES composition, oxidation temperature, oxidation time, and H2O2 dosage on desulfurization of CTP were investigated. The results show that trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/ChCl DES has a certain effect in catalyzing the oxidative desulfurization of CTP, and the optimal desulfurization rate of CTP reaches 38.7%. The products obtained under various reaction conditions were analyzed by means of elemental analysis, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. The results show that the oxidative desulfurization of CTP catalyzed by acidic DES not only greatly improves hydrophilicity of CTP to solvent by introducing a certain amount of oxygen-containing functional groups, but also changes surface micromorphology of CTP, resulting in cracks and small particles. All these promote oxidation of thiophene sulfur in CTP to sulfone, which is further oxidized to soluble sulfate, thereby achieving sulfur removal. At the same time, oxygen content of CTP after DES catalytic oxidation treatment is relatively low, which has little effect on crystal alignment of carbonized pitch char. This work provides a technical basis for expanding high-value utilization of high-sulfur CTP.
