You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue in a laboratory scale screw type reactor Polymeric fraction of automobile shredder residue (ASR) was pyrolyzed in a laboratory scale screw type reactor under various conditions. All components of ASR and also a representative mixed sample of ASR were studied by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), elemental analysis, bomb calorimetry and atomic emission spectrometry (AES). The ASR sample used in the laboratory pyrolysis apparatus contained mainly plastics, rubber, textiles, foam and other organics. The pyrolysis experiments were conducted at reactor temperatures ranging from 550 to 800°C, providing solid (30–34wt%), liquid (7–28wt%) and gas (42–65wt%) pyrolysis products. Composition of pyrolysis gases was measured online by a microchromatograph. By increasing the temperature, the content of hydrogen and CO in the gas fraction increased while that of light hydrocarbons decreased. The content of methane showed a maximum at 750°C. For pyrolysis char, its proximate and elemental composition, higher heating value and heavy metal content were determined. Char contained around 48wt% of fixed carbon; its sulfur content increased from 1.12wt% for char produced at 550°C to 2.31wt% for char produced at 800°C; its higher heating value varied between 14–19MJ/kg. Influence of the initial ASR composition was investigated as well. Increasing the content of rubber resulted in an increase of the char yield, while by increasing the plastic content, the gas yield increased. No significant effect of the ASR composition on the amount of liquid pyrolysis product was observed.
