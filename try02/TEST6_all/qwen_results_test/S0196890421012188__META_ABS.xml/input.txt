Novel carbon-negative methane production via integrating anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis of organic fraction of municipal solid waste The use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is vital to reaching the desired climate goals. This study proposed a novel process combining anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, catalytic reforming and methanation (APRM) to produce biomethane and to capture carbon emission from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The evaluation of the process was conducted by using modelling software and techno-economic analysis. The process modelling and evaluation result showed that 151.4 kg CH4 and 355.64 kg stored carbon emission can be produced from 1 ton dry matter of OFMSW with an energy efficiency of 0.40. 6.74 MJ electricity was required to capture 1 kg of CO2 via the proposed process. The energy balance of the pyrolysis reaction was investigated. The sensitivities of the pyrolysis temperatures, dewatering technologies and conversion of catalytic reforming on the process performance were analyzed. The result also indicated a positive net profit when using the APRM process to treat the OFMSW based on the calculation of operating expenses and revenue, when the CO2 negativity can be sold as commodity.
