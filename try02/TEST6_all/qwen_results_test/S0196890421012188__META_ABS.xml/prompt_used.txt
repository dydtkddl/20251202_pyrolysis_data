You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel carbon-negative methane production via integrating anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis of organic fraction of municipal solid waste The use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is vital to reaching the desired climate goals. This study proposed a novel process combining anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, catalytic reforming and methanation (APRM) to produce biomethane and to capture carbon emission from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The evaluation of the process was conducted by using modelling software and techno-economic analysis. The process modelling and evaluation result showed that 151.4 kg CH4 and 355.64 kg stored carbon emission can be produced from 1 ton dry matter of OFMSW with an energy efficiency of 0.40. 6.74 MJ electricity was required to capture 1 kg of CO2 via the proposed process. The energy balance of the pyrolysis reaction was investigated. The sensitivities of the pyrolysis temperatures, dewatering technologies and conversion of catalytic reforming on the process performance were analyzed. The result also indicated a positive net profit when using the APRM process to treat the OFMSW based on the calculation of operating expenses and revenue, when the CO2 negativity can be sold as commodity.
