You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A systematic protocol of microplastics analysis from their identification to quantification in water environment: A comprehensive review With microplastics (MPs) being detected in aquatic environments, numerous studies revealed that they caused severe environmental issues, including damage to ecosystems and human health. MPs transport persistent organic pollutants by adsorbing them, and in nanoplastics this phenomenon is exacerbated by increased surface area. Despite their environmental risk, systematic protocol for qualitative and quantitative analysis are yet to be established in environmental analytical chemistry. Current analytical technologies on MP identification have technological limits with regard to detecting small sized particles (<1 µm), underestimation of MPs with organic contaminants, and physico-chemically altered particles by weathering and photo degradation. According to the published works, MPs are spread in living organisms through the food web, and are even detected in bottled water. To determine its eco-toxicity and removal by biodegradation, its accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility should be ensured by establishing a systematic protocol of MP identification. This review compares procedures, applicability, and limitations of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermo-analytical methods for identifying MPs. Finally, it suggests systematic protocols for MPs analysis.
