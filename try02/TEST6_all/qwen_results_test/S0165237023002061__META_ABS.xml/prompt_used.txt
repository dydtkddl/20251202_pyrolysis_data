You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pilot-scale flue gas pyrolysis system for organic and plastic wastes with improved liquid properties in a non-thermal plasma reactor A fast, oxidative pyrolysis system was developed to produce a pyrolysis liquid (PyOL) upgraded with a non-thermal plasma (NTP) reactor. In addition to the 1.8 million tonnes per annum of plastic wastes, large amounts of municipal solid waste in Malaysia end up in landfills, of which 40–60 % is organic or food waste. Organic and plastic wastes (OPW) can be used as carbon feedstocks for the pyrolysis process to produce PyOL, reducing the OPW disposal in landfills, and carbon emissions. However, the current pyrolysis methods use pure nitrogen, implying increased operational cost, and are commonly performed at the lab scale. In this study, flue gas was used for the pyrolysis of OPW at a pilot scale. The use of flue gas for PyOL production reduces the operational costs and lifecycle carbon emissions. Results show that the addition of a small percentage of plastics at the pyrolysis temperature of 350 °C increased the yield of liquid. However, large amounts of plastics resulted in significant material agglomeration. A disadvantage of PyOL is the degradation of properties with respect to storage time. Therefore, a NTP reactor was developed to improve the PyOL properties. After NTP treatment, the aromatic and carbonyl ester groups decrease, the calorific value increased, and certain chemical compounds increased in concentration. This study provides operational parameters for the pilot scale pyrolysis (and waste-to-energy) process, improving the technical viability of scaling-up such systems.
