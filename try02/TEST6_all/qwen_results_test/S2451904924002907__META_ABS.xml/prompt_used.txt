You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Discernment of synergism in co-pyrolysis of starch, lignin, and cellulose: Properties and reactivity of char production Starch, lignin, and cellulose are selected as representatives of solid waste, and the effects of these three main components and their interactions on the characteristics of the corresponding pyrolysis char are researched. The findings indicate that the interaction between starch (0.0216 min−1) and lignin (0.0203 min−1) could result in a lower oxidation reaction rate (0.0172 min−1) of the pyrolysis of their char mixture, which is associated with a slight collapse of the fibrous sheet structure. According to the comparison of the crystalline phases identified by X-ray diffractometry research, the interaction between lignin and cellulose improves the degree of carbon ordering, leading to the presence of C-faces (100) in the lignin + cellulose char sample. Raman analysis explains that the interaction between starch and lignin results in increased size and thickness of graphitic domains, and a similar trend is observed in the starch and cellulose char samples. Conversely, the band area ratio ID4/IG values of the mixed char samples are comparable to those of the two corresponding single-component char samples, indicating that no interaction occurs in the sp2–sp3 mixed structures. The results indicate that the carbon conversion increases with increasing temperature. Otherwise, the interaction between lignin and cellulose improves the degree of carbon ordering. The results of this study are anticipated to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interactions of waste components on char production by pyrolysis of solid wastes.
