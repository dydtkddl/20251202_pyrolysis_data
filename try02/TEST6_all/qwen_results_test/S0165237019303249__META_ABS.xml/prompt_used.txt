You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate: Online monitoring of gas production and quantitative analysis of waxy products The slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated over a range of final temperatures from 410 °C to 480 °C yielding a wide variety of species. The objective of the current study was to provide thermal dependent evolution profile for mass loss and pyrolysis gas, in addition to the partial quantification of the waxy products. The polymer degradation was first characterized by thermogravimetric analysis. Many parameters were studied such as final temperature, heating rate, flow rate and the presence or not of a lid on the crucible. The slow pyrolysis of PET was then performed in a horizontal tubular reactor at 5 °C/min. The pyrolysis products were analysed, focusing especially on gaseous and waxy fractions. The gas emitted was monitored online by μ-GC which allowed establishing their real time evolution profile. Carbonyl species were analyzed using HPLC. As a result, the gas contained mainly acetaldehyde, CO and CO2, and to a smaller extent ethylene and benzene. Benzene profile exhibited two peaks, indicating that there may be two steps or two main reactions in the release of this compound. The waxy products were characterized by GC/MS-FID and FTIR techniques. FTIR showed that the main chemical moieties of the waxy products were carboxylic acids and esters. GC/MS-FID confirmed that these pyrolysates contained mainly benzoic acid and its derivatives and monovinyl terephthalate. The quantitative analysis showed that the highest production of benzoic acid was obtained at 430 °C. Its yield is 11% of initial PET mass.
