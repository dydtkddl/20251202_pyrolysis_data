You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D printed scaffolds for biomedical applications The surge of population led to the urgency of a novel array of devised biofunctional frameworks, adapted to revitalize the functionality of degenerative tissues, and to lift patient's worth of living through tissue-engineered scaffolds competent to foster cellular adhesion, multiplication, and divergence. In this context, ceramic materials have been of great significance considering its inertness inside our body, and intrinsic hardness and abrasion resistance make them widely used as a biomaterial in bone replacement. However, its innate brittleness still limits its wide application in the biomedical field. The enhancement and the inclusion of diverse 3D printing techniques fabricated ceramics or bioceramics, which profoundly bolster their application. 3D ceramic scaffolds have excellent mechanical strength and wear resistance, low electrical conductivity, and make it the best candidate even in the drug delivery field. Hydroxyapatite(HAp) bioglass alumina composite scaffold has compressive strength as high as 157 ± 2 MPa, the tensile strength of 83 ± 2 MPa , and porosity ranging from 20 to 25%. Currently, these materials used in hard tissue engineering of the dental, middle ear, spinal, and otolaryngology surgery. In this review, we mainly focus on the 3D ceramic scaffolds-its fabrication techniques, ceramic materials used, advantages, applications, and finally, their future scopes.
