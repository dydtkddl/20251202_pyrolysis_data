You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative catalytic efficacy of cost-effective MIL-101(Cr) based PET waste for biodiesel production Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) use has increased, causing more PET trash and environmental and health issues. Disposal and burning alone cannot solve this problem. Thus, PET recovery methods with low byproducts are the priority. The recycling rate is still below 30%, so different cleaning methods are being investigated. Therefore, studies have focused on extracting terephthalic acid from PET bottles for MOF synthesis to reduce their cost of production. Herein, MIL-101(Cr) was synthesized from PET bottles and used as a solid catalyst for oleic acid esterification with methanol to produce methyl oleate (biodiesel), an alternative energy source to fossil fuels—the highest biodiesel yields at 1:39 molar ratio of oleic acid to MeOH, 6 wt% loading, 65 °C, and 4 h reactions time were attained at 86.9 and 80% for MIL-101(Cr) on a pristine and scrap basis, respectively. The kinetic study revealed that activation energies were 25.27 kJ/mol and 28.3 kJ/mol for original and waste-derived MIL-101(Cr). The waste-derived MIL-101(Cr) was reused three times while five-time cycles for the original MIL-101(Cr).
