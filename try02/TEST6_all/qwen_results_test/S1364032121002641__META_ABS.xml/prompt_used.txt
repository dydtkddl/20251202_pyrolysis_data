You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on the development stage of biorefinery systems towards the management of apple processing-derived waste Apple is among the most consumed fruits in the world and the expansion of their processing is increasing the generation of waste such as apple pomace. It finds some applications in food and feed systems, anaerobic digestion, and composting; however it most ends in landfills or in informal disposal. Therefore, waste management strategies that address this waste accumulation need to be explored. This review provides a state-of-art of valorization strategies adopted for recovery of value added products from apple processing-derived waste and discusses on their development stage. The research community has laid most of its efforts on incorporation of apple pomace into feed and food systems and in the development of pectin- and phenolics-extraction methods. Incorporation of apple pomace in feed and food systems is still negligible due to its low protein and high fiber contents. Therefore, coupling apple pomace with microbial conversion for nutritional upgrade could change this scenario. Some environmentally-friendly techniques have been developed for extraction of pectin and phenolics, but major developments are needed on their integration to attain tailored extraction of several compounds. Recovery of value added routes of apple pomace towards production of bio-chemicals are characterized by lack of deep research studies and of a holistic approach. Integrated approach with techno-economic analysis, life-cycle assessment, and inter-sectorial initiatives will possibly reveal the most promising valorization routes.
