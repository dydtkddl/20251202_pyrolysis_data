You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of linear low density polyethylene into carbon nanomaterials under the combined catalysis of Ni2O3 and poly(vinyl chloride) A one-pot method was used to prepare magnetic Ni/carbon (Ni/C) nanomaterials by catalytic carbonization of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) under the combined catalysis of Ni2O3 and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin. The yield of Ni/C nanomaterials was determined by the pyrolysis temperature, the type and the content of PVC resin. The yield of magnetic Ni/C nanomaterials first increased and then decreased with increasing PVC content. The obtained carbon nanomaterials mainly consisted of long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at lower PVC content but short carbon nanofibers and amorphous carbon at higher PVC content. This is attributed to chlorine radicals from the decomposition of PVC resin promoting the dehydrogenation and aromatization of LLDPE macroradical fragments. The obtained magnetic Ni/C nanomaterials were used as adsorbents for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from water and showed an adsorption capacity as high as 165.5–175.2mg/g, indicating the resultant magnetic Ni/C nanomaterials had potential application in wastewater treatment.
