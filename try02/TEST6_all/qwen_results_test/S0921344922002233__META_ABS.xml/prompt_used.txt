You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particle-scale modelling of the pyrolysis of end-of-life solar panel particles in fluidized bed reactors The end-of-life solar panels can be disassembled through pyrolysis by removing the binder - ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) for panel recycling, yet its research is still in its early stages. In this study, a reactive discrete element method - computational fluid dynamics (rDEM-CFD) model is developed to study the physical-thermal characteristics of dense gas-solid reacting flow related to the solar panel particles’ pyrolysis in two typical chemical reactors - fixed bed (FB) and bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactors. The simulation results show that the overall EVA removal degree in the BFB is higher than that in the FB. Then the two key parameters are studied including wall temperature and superficial gas velocity in the BFB. The results show that the EVA removal degrees are improved considerably, from 91.03%, 94.89%, to 99.99%, as the wall temperature increases from 723 K, 773 K, to 823 K. In contrast, the EVA removal degrees at the superficial gas velocity of 1.25 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 1.75 m/s are similar, i.e., 94.67%, 94.89%, and 95.45%, respectively. The underlying mechanism is explored: the BFB shows better heat and mass transfer performance than the FB, such as more uniform temperature distribution, higher Re and Nu numbers, and larger heat transfer fluxes; on the other hand, increasing wall temperature decreases the Re and Nu numbers while elevating superficial gas velocity enlarges the Re and Nu numbers in the BFB. The study is useful for pyrolyzer design and optimization for efficient solar panel recycling.
