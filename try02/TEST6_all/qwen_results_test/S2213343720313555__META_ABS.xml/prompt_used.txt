You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pelleting spent coffee grounds by waste utensils as binders of biofuels New generations of biofuels innovative combined (bio-)waste resources of spent coffee grounds (SCGs), chopsticks, and polypropylene (PP) spoons were successfully achieved in this study. The SCG pellets were compressed at load force of 40 kgf/cm2 for 3 min and torrefied for 1 h at 300 °C during the manufacturing processes. The highest heating value of the sample was 26.21 MJ/kg with 50% SCGs, 20% chopsticks, and 30% PP spoons. The solid yields of chopsticks and PP spoons were ca. 2.45% (w/w) and 3.35% (w/w) when increasing 10% of the waste utensils, respectively. The content of the fixed carbon was in a range of 17–34.68% in the SCG samples. Mixing chopsticks is helpful for increasing fixed carbon content, and PP spoons is helpful for increasing heating values of the biofuels. The TGA results found that decreasing SCG contents increased weight loss of the samples within experimental period. The SEM images showed an incorporation of SCG with waste utensils formed a homogeneous and continuous surface with a good compatibility. The SCG samples manufactured in this study had higher carbon contents (70.40–78.34%) than previous studies of SCGs. Using PP utensils did not contribute chlorine contents (0%) but small contribution of sulfur (0.41%) and chlorine (0.10%) contents of the samples were from chopsticks. The results of this study are useful for reducing wastes and creating renewable energy in the modern energy demanded world.
