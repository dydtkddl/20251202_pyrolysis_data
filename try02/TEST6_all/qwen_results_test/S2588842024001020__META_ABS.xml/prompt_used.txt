You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Salt melt synthesis of efficient carbon-based microwave absorber Carbon-based microwave absorption (MA) materials play a crucial role in MA field. The carbon-based MA materials prepared by molten salt method (MSM) have the advantages of green, efficient, and large-scale production. In this paper, CNT/Ni3S2 and Graphene/Ni3S2 MA materials are prepared by MSM, and both two materials are systematically characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS and other methods. Besides, the MA performances and electromagnetic (EM) properties of the two materials are analyzed. The results indicate that the optical reflection loss (RL) of the CNT/Ni3S2 composite can reach −62.45 dB at a thickness of 1.66 mm, and its effective absorption band (EAB) can reach 5.64 GHz at a thickness of 1.49 mm in the range of 2–18 GHz. The optical RL of the G/Ni3S2 composite can reach −55.71 dB at a thickness of 2.64 mm, and its EAB can reach 4.44 GHz at a thickness of 1.95 mm. Both materials have effective MA performance. This paper extends the application of MSM in the MA field.
