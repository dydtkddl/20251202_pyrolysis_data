Salt melt synthesis of efficient carbon-based microwave absorber Carbon-based microwave absorption (MA) materials play a crucial role in MA field. The carbon-based MA materials prepared by molten salt method (MSM) have the advantages of green, efficient, and large-scale production. In this paper, CNT/Ni3S2 and Graphene/Ni3S2 MA materials are prepared by MSM, and both two materials are systematically characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS and other methods. Besides, the MA performances and electromagnetic (EM) properties of the two materials are analyzed. The results indicate that the optical reflection loss (RL) of the CNT/Ni3S2 composite can reach −62.45 dB at a thickness of 1.66 mm, and its effective absorption band (EAB) can reach 5.64 GHz at a thickness of 1.49 mm in the range of 2–18 GHz. The optical RL of the G/Ni3S2 composite can reach −55.71 dB at a thickness of 2.64 mm, and its EAB can reach 4.44 GHz at a thickness of 1.95 mm. Both materials have effective MA performance. This paper extends the application of MSM in the MA field.
