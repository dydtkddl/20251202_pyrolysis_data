You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-oil and biochar from microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of corn stover using sodium carbonate catalyst In the present study, bio-oil and biochar have been produced from microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of corn stover (CS). The effects of microwave power (MWP) and mixing of sodium carbonate as a catalyst at different ratios have been examined. Both MWP and the catalyst improved the heating and increased the maximum temperatures of pyrolysis process. Rise in MWP increased the gas yield but decreased the biochar yield, while the bio-oil yield was not significantly affected. The use of catalyst increased the bio-oil yield and enhanced its properties. Increase in the ratios of catalyst from 10% to 30%, did not contribute a significant effect either on the yield or on the properties of the products. The water content in bio-oil was found to be in the range of 53.09–73.79%, while the minimum viscosity was observed to be 3.31 mPa s. The maximum higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil and biochar were 13.17 MJ/kg and 29.77 MJ/kg respectively. The bio-oil samples were characterized chemically by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Most of the chemical group compounds in the bio-oil were identified to be alcohol, phenols, alkynes, acids, and aromatic. The net energy recovery from the raw CS was in the range of 28.29–42.97%.
