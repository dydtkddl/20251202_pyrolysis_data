Study of different polymer nanocomposites and their pollutant removal efficiency: Review In this paper different conducting polymer nanocomposites are reviewed for their application in removing heavy metal ions and dyes from the aqueous solution typically for the treatment of wastewater using methodologies such as adsorption and photodegradation. The combined properties obtained due to the combination of conducting polymer and nanofiller in preparing polymer nanocomposite, make them superior in the application of wastewater treatment. This paper provides an insight into various synthesis methods and compares different types of conducting polymer and nanofiller in preparing polymer nanocomposite. The analysis presented in the paper will help the reader to follow a particular method of synthesis and functionalization technique to prepare a required polymer nanocomposite based on their requirement in removing the type of pollutants from the wastewater and also the regeneration of polymer nanocomposite for its further reusability. Moreover, a section is also devoted to carbon dot-based polymer nanocomposite which nowadays has got attention among researchers due to their tuneable fluorescence and photochemical properties in wastewater treatment.
