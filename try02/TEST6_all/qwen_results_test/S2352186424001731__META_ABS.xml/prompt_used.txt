You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis solid product as a sorbent for flue gases mercury capture — Part I: Sorbent formation and characteristics This study investigates the pyrolysis of various materials (solid recovered fuel, digestate, hay pellets, straw, polyethylene, and tires) at temperatures ranging from 350 to 650 °C, with retention times between 90 and 190 minutes and a heating rate of 10 °C∙min–1. Its focus is on utilizing pyrolysis residue-char as a sorbent for mercury capture from flue gas during conventional fuel combustion. Physical and chemical activation techniques employing NaOH as an oxidizing agent are used to enhance surface area and pore volume. Characterization techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and various analyses, are employed. Results indicate solid fraction recoveries of 77%wt. for solid recovered fuel, 58%wt. for tires, and 48%wt. for straw, with average recoveries of 47%wt. solid, 18.7%wt. gaseous, and 34.3%wt. liquid fractions. After applying the activation processes, the results reveal that the most suitable sorbent is the straw sample, where the specific surface area and pore volume are 148.95 m2∙g–1 and 0.0569 cm3∙g–1 after physical activation and 640.98 m2∙g–1 and 0.2867 cm3∙g–1 after chemical activation, respectively. These findings suggest promising applications for pyrolysis char as sorbents, with significant improvements achieved through activation methods. The application of the developed sorbents for mercury capture in a real flue gas environment is closely investigated in Part II of this study.
