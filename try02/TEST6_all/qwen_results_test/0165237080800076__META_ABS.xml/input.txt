Feedstock characterization and prediction of product yields for industrial naphtha crackers on the basis of laboratory and bench-scale pyrolysis A new severity function has been introduced in order to plot and evaluate the yield data from hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It is demonstrated that the new severity function can also be used for the presentation of product yields obtained from hydrocarbon mixtures and naphtha fractions. In order to characterize and evaluate available feedstocks for olefin production, yields for seven naphtha fractions were determined in a bench-scale reactor. It was established that the yields of ethylene and propylene obtained from the different naphtha fractions increase proportionally with the increase in the characterization factor. On the basis of pyrolysis experiments carried out in laboratory, bench-scale and pilot reactors and in a commercial furnace it is shown that by using the new severity function the yield data obtained in reactors of different sizes and operating under different conditions can be directly compared and uniformly evaluated. The feasibility of micro-scale pyrolysis-gas chromatography for predicting product yields and evaluating naphtha feedstocks is also discussed.
