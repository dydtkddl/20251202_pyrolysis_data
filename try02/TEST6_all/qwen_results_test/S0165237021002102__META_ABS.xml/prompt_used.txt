You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-based liquids and solids from sustainable feedstock: Production and analysis Thermal pyrolysis of a non-edible feedstock, wild (Brassica juncea L.) seeds (WMS) in a fixed-bed reactor for creating bio-oil (BO) and biochar (BC) was the essential scope of this work. Pyrolysis of the WMS was accomplished at various temperatures for varied durations using different WMS particle sizes at different heating rates. The typical yield of liquid products was 49.55 ± 2.50 % with BO content of 32.62 % when the MTS thermal pyrolysis was carried out under the optimum conditions (475 °C, heating rate of 20 °C/min, 60 min, the particle diameter:70 mesh). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), proton- nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), GC–MS, and ultimate analysis have been employed to characterize the attained BO. The FTIR, 1H NMR, and GC–MS studies revealed that the obtained BO generally comprises mono-aromatic, oxygenates, alkanes, alkenes, higher acids, and nitriles. These compounds are similar to those existing in the other BO samples established in the literature. Elemental analysis studies showed that the chemical formula of BO from WMS is CH1.13 N0.001S0.002 O 0.36 with a calorific value of 24.40 MJ/kg. The BC was transformed into activated charcoal (AC) through the ZnCl2 activation method. The iodine number, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the typical AC sample were measured. The findings disclosed that a high amorphous carbon with 450 mg/g iodine number was acquired under optimum conditions. The outcomes thus revealed that the BO from WMS has the prospective to be employed as a substitute for conventional petro-fuels or a source of chemicals. Also, the BC can be implemented as a solid fuel or in the synthesis of AC.
