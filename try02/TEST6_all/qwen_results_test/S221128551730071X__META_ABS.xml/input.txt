Textured CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with enhanced stability for high performance perovskite solar cells MAPbI3 perovskite is an important component for high-performance perovskite solar cell (PSC) but its own thin film stability is challenging in PSC community. Herein, we report a high crystallinity perovskite MAPbI3 with texture structure prepared from HPbI3 reacted with low partial pressure (LPP) MA gas, that has substantially higher both thermal and moisture stability than polycrystalline perovskite (PP) prepared from MAI+PbI2. A prototype reactor is developed to perform coordination engineering between MA vapor and HPbI3 solid and facilitate the large-scale fabrication. The large Pb-N binding energy (~80.04kJmol−1) results in the liquefied state after MA adhesion. Finally, a high texture perovskite (TP) is formed after excess MA expeditious releasing. The MA-rich passivation through Pb-N bonding at interface and boundary contributes to the substantial improved stability. Besides, MA-rich species trigger an anti-degradation reaction in presence of moisture and thus endow stability above two months under ~65% humidity. The textured PSCs (TPSCs) deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) between 15.5% and champion 18.9% in the batch deposition. Therefore, the coordination engineering improves the efficiency, stability, scalability and ease of fabrication together.
