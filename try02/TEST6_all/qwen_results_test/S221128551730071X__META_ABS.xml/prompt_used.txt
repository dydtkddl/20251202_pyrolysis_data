You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Textured CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with enhanced stability for high performance perovskite solar cells MAPbI3 perovskite is an important component for high-performance perovskite solar cell (PSC) but its own thin film stability is challenging in PSC community. Herein, we report a high crystallinity perovskite MAPbI3 with texture structure prepared from HPbI3 reacted with low partial pressure (LPP) MA gas, that has substantially higher both thermal and moisture stability than polycrystalline perovskite (PP) prepared from MAI+PbI2. A prototype reactor is developed to perform coordination engineering between MA vapor and HPbI3 solid and facilitate the large-scale fabrication. The large Pb-N binding energy (~80.04kJmol−1) results in the liquefied state after MA adhesion. Finally, a high texture perovskite (TP) is formed after excess MA expeditious releasing. The MA-rich passivation through Pb-N bonding at interface and boundary contributes to the substantial improved stability. Besides, MA-rich species trigger an anti-degradation reaction in presence of moisture and thus endow stability above two months under ~65% humidity. The textured PSCs (TPSCs) deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) between 15.5% and champion 18.9% in the batch deposition. Therefore, the coordination engineering improves the efficiency, stability, scalability and ease of fabrication together.
