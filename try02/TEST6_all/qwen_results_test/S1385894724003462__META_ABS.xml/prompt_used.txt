You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards a better understanding of the cosolvent effect on the low-temperature glycolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) As the demand of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) increases worldwide along with the waste generated from its use, it is urgent to develop cost-efficient and sustainable recycling processes, such as depolymerization that yields monomers with virgin-like qualities. However, most of these processes require harsh conditions and their true mechanisms are poorly understood, leading to marginal gains in energy efficiency and yield. In spite of the lack of solubility of PET, we demonstrate that the swelling and plastification of PET in a good solvent allows a better mass transport of ethylene glycol and the catalyst into the polymer during glycolysis. Based on these insights, we report a process in which PET is depolymerized into bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) with a yield of 88 % at 65 °C within 1 h in the presence of 1,3-Dioxolane as green cosolvent carrier. The improved mass transport allows to perform the depolymerization of PET even below the T g of the polymer. Indeed, by kinetic modelling we demonstrated that a heterogeneous depolymerization process could be easily transformed into an homogeneous process by an appropriate solvent selection. The environmental impact of the proposed process, including solvent recovery, is compared to the solvent-free counterpart and the results demonstrates that by using 1,3-Dioxolane, the carbon footprint of the newly developed glycolysis process can be reduced up to 20 % due to the increased energy efficiency. This process enables a viable recycling strategy of PET into its repetitive unit, contributing to the development of competitive chemical recycling solutions to reduce PET-derived pollution.
