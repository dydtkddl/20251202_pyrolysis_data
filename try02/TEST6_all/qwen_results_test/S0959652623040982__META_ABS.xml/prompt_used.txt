You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Energetic and environmental optimizations and byproduct valorization of pyrolysis of textile dyeing sludge with FeCl3 Maximizing the circular economy of hazardous wastes is one of the imperatives not to overshoot the biogeochemical limits of Earth. This study aimed to characterize and valorize the textile dyeing sludge (TDS) pyrolysis in response to the addition of FeCl3 conditioner in the N2 and CO2 atmospheres. The increase fraction of FeCl3 decreased comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI 600 ) from 1.05 to 0.42 in the N2 atmosphere and from 0.71 to 0.41 in the CO2 atmosphere at 20 °C/min. The addition of FeCl3 diminished the pyrolysis performance, with a more pronounced inhibitory effect occurring in the N2 atmosphere than in the CO2 atmosphere. Regardless of the type of pyrolysis atmosphere, with or without FeCl3, all the TDS pyrolysis released CO, CO2, CH4, aromatics, NH3, and SO2. The main pyrolytic byproducts were nitrides and hydrocarbons, represented by ethanolamine (C2H7NO) and benzene (C6H6). Not only did 4 % FeCl3 addition facilitate the transformation of nitrides into hydrocarbons during the pyrolysis, but it also achieved the optimal energetic performance and emission reduction. Our findings provide novel and actionable insights into the byproduct valorization and pollution control during the TDS pyrolysis and the promotion of carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
