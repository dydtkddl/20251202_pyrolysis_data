You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation, non-isothermal kinetic study and optimization of oil shale pyrolysis using two-step reaction network: Maximization of shale oil and shale gas production Production of petroleum from pyrolysis of oil shale could offer a solution to meet the current high energy demands. In this respect, optimizing reaction-dependent parameters during pyrolysis kinetics is crucial for achieving this goal commercially. Thus, in this study, experimental pyrolysis of oil shale samples was conducted in the temperature range of 270–495 °C, with the reaction time of 10–235 min, and a heating rate of 2 °C/min in a fixed bed reactor. Composition and weight of different hydrocarbon fractions (bitumen, shale oil, shale gas, water, and char) based on the reaction pathways were measured. Desired reaction conditions to achieve the maximum petroleum production from the pyrolysis reactions were specified based on the design of the experiment (DOE) following response surface methodology (RSM). Empirical correlations were developed for the prediction of the amount of shale oil and gas, by considering the reaction time, reaction temperature and the char amount as the main governing factors. For the first time, multi-objective optimization was applied to determine the optimal operational parameters, with the aim of maximizing petroleum production. Finally, mass balance equations coupled with second order reactions based on two-step pyrolysis reaction pathway (intermediate bitumen as the transition fraction) were implemented for kinetic modeling. Statistical and graphical evaluations of the kinetic model as well as the proposed correlation, verified an excellent agreement between the models and the experimental composition of pyrolysis products. Moreover, multi-objective optimization revealed that a concurrent maximum shale oil (1.92 gr) and gas (5.72 gr) production from the oil shale (20 gr), reaction temperature, reaction time, and char amount of 457.34, 198.356, and 16.385, would be the optimized reaction-dependent factors. Interactive plots indicated that interactions between time and temperature are not significant for pyrolysis reaction; however, there is a single intersection point between the reaction temperature-char weight and the reaction time-char weight. This, delineated that reaction time (t > 190 min), reaction temperature (T > 440 °C) and higher values of char amount (24.4 gr) would be more favorable to attain higher oil production. Optimal reaction temperature, time, char amount for the maximum oil (5.72 %) and gas (1.92 %) production would be 457.34 °C, 198.35 min, 16.38 %, respectively, while conversion of kerogen to intermediate bitumen (preliminary step) followed by the oil production from the intermediate bitumen (secondary step) were found to be the most significant reactions taking place during pyrolysis. Finally, reaction temperature and time would have a positive relationship with the production of desired yield, while char amount has an inverse relationship with these outputs. Overall, this study should provide specific guidelines for implementing in-situ pyrolysis operations underground in immature organic-rich shale and coal beds.
