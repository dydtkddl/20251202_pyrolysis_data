You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorisation of digestate: Characteristics, products, processes and potential Anaerobic digestion (AD) plays a critical role in meeting renewable energy needs and managing solid and liquid waste streams, thereby making significant contributions towards sustainability and the circular economy. However, AD generates a large amount of digestate as a by-product. Digestate contains undigested organic fractions, micro and macro-nutrients, inorganic materials, trace metals etc. It is essential to develop appropriate ways for managing and valorising digestate for truly harnessing the potential of AD. This review critically analyses the current state of the art on valorisation and management of digestate. It starts with a review of key digestate characteristics that have a great impact on the valorisation potential and products. Different valorisation pathways based on the analysis of digestate properties are then reviewed. The interaction among characteristics of digestate, valorisation technologies, potential products and economic challenges is critically reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the separation technologies, advanced valorisation processes and their potential are discussed. Techno-economic aspects are briefly discussed. Some comments on policies and regulations are included. Key conclusions on the state of the art, specific suggestions for further research, and some comments on the outlook are included at the end. The review will be useful to researchers, technologists, and policymakers interested in sustainability and the circular economy.
