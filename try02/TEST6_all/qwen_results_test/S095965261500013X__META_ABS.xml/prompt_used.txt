You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of grape industrial processing waste to activated carbon sorbent and its performance in cationic and anionic dyes adsorption Grape processing industry waste was used as a novel precursor for the production of a low-cost activated carbon with zinc chloride chemical activation. The effects of the production variables, such as impregnation ratio, activation temperature and activation time on the some textural properties were investigated. The optimal activated carbon which had the highest surface area and pore volume was obtained by these conditions as follows: 6:1 impregnation ratio, 600 °C activation temperature and 60 min activation time. The optimum conditions resulted in an activated carbon with a carbon content of 81.76% and a yield of 44.13%, while the surface area of 1455 m2/g, with the total pore volume of 2.318 cm3/g, mesoporosity of 94.61% and average pore diameter of 6.81 nm. These results showed that the grape wastes seemed to be an alternative precursor for the commercial activated carbon productions. The adsorptive property was tested using Methylene blue and Metanil yellow dyes. The adsorption behaviors for both dyes were well described by the Langmuir isotherm model, showing a monolayer adsorption capacity of 417 mg/g and 386 mg/g for Methylene blue and Metanil yellow, respectively. This study demonstrated that produced optimal activated carbon could be employed as an efficient cleaner to compare with the commercial ones for the removal cationic and anionic dyes from wastewater.
