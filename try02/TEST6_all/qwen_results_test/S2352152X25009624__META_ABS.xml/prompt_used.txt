You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable upcycling of polypropylene-based masks into high-performance carbon materials for supercapacitors via molten salt carbonization and air activation Carbonization is a promising method for upcycling polypropylene (PP)-based plastic waste into high-value carbon materials, yet direct pyrolysis typically suffers from low carbon yield due to significant volatile losses. In this study, we propose a sustainable and integrated approach utilizing thiourea-promoted molten salt carbonization to enhance the carbon yield from PP-based waste masks. The incorporation of thiourea stabilizes the carbon structure by reducing excessive fragmentation of the carbon backbone, significantly increasing the carbon yield from 7.3 % to 21.6 %. Simultaneously, thiourea introduces sulfur and nitrogen co-doping, enhancing conductivity and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, air activation is employed to optimize the pore structure, increase surface area, and introduce oxygen-containing functional groups, greatly improving ion diffusion and electrolyte wettability. The resulting air-activated sulfur- and nitrogen-doped carbon materials exhibit exceptional electrochemical performance, with a specific capacitance of 345.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability, retaining 93.3 % capacitance after 20,000 cycles. The corresponding symmetric supercapacitor demonstrates an energy density of 40.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1, alongside excellent cycling stability. This integrated strategy provides a sustainable pathway for converting PP-based waste plastics into high-performance carbon materials, with significant potential for applications in energy storage and environmental remediation.
