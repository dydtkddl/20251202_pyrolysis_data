You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Intensified effect of K adhering to hematite involved in the sulfurous chemical looping gasification When sulfur in petroleum coke (petcoke) converts to H2S instead of SO2, it is the resource which can be recovered by Claus process. Chemical looping gasification (CLG) is capable of achieving petcoke conversion and sulfur recovery. To simultaneously overcome the obstacles of low gasification reactivity and improve H2 and H2S production, hematite modified by K as oxygen carrier (OC) was involved in the high-sulfur system to investigate the effect on sulfur conversion via batch fluidized bed in petcoke CLG process. K enhanced H2 generation beyond expectation because K not only improved the petcoke gasification but also enhanced the steam oxidation of deep reductive OC. Especially when using 10 % KNO3-hematite, H2 yield increased by 3.9 times as compared to 0 % K, with the carbon conversion efficiency of 99.92 % in the 22nd minute. The different K sources had a different H2 selectivity. The sulfur fate had been originally studied using K-modified hematite OC. H2S was the main phase of sulfur release and the high H2 yield also assisted H2S production. Introducing K contributed to in-situ sulfur capture forming K-Fe-S compounds in the OCs due to the deep reduction of Fe. 10 % KNO3-hematite exhibited excellent cyclic stability with a H2 volume fraction of more than 65 % in 21 cycles. Furthermore, the mechanism of hematite modified by K involved in sulfur-containing system was summarized in petcoke CLG process.
