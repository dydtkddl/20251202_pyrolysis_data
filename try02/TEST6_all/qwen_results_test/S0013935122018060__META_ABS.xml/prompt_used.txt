You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic interaction of metal loaded multifactorial nanocatalysts over bifunctional transalkylation for environmental applications A feasible and cost-effective process for utilization of toluene and heavy reformate is the conversion of its streams by transalkylation reaction into highly valuable xylenes. The process is usually catalysed by zeolites and the challenges to overcome in transalkylation of heavy reformate with toluene over zeolites are their selectivity, activity, long-term stability, and coke formation. Current study aimed to investigate xylenes production by transalkylation reaction on the synthesized metal-doped zeolite catalysts and to characterize prepared catalysts by FTIR, SEM, EDS and BET analysis. Toluene/heavy reformate modelled mixture was utilized as a feed. For the first time Beta and ZSM-5 catalysts with 10% (w/w) cerium and 0.1% (w/w) palladium were synthesized by calcination and wet impregnation method. Catalytic tests were performed by continuous-flow gas/solid catalytic fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure, 2 h−1 and 5 h−1 and 250, 300, 350 and 400 °C. Experimental results revealed that the highest heavy reformate conversion (98.94%) and toluene conversion (9.82%) were obtained over H-ZSM-5, at 400 °C and 2 h−1 WHSV. The highest xylene selectivity (11.53) was achieved over H-ZSM-5, and the highest p-xylene percentage (62.40%), using Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst. ZSM-5 catalysts showed more resistance to coke deposition than Beta zeolites. The present study delivers novel approach and catalysts, which have immense potential for developing safer and inexpensive transalkylation process in industry.
