You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Continuous supercritical hydrothermal synthesis of stabilized ZrO2 nanocomposites: Doping mechanism of typical metals and transition elements In this study, Mg, Ce, Y and La-doped nano-zirconia particles were successfully obtained by continuous supercritical hydrothermal synthesis combined with nanotechnology and crystal stabilization technology. Through detailed characterization and analysis of the structure, crystal form, grain size of the particles and by-products, the doping amount of different element dopants was optimized, and the stable pathway of tetragonal and cubic phases was proposed. Moreover, the doping mechanisms of different elements and phase diagram of doped nano-zirconia were revealed. The results show that the crystal form is determined by the doping amount, ionic radius and intrinsic properties of ions. Y and Ce doping can completely stabilize the tetragonal or cubic phase without the formation of by-products. Mg and La doping produce by-products of Mg(OH)2 and La2O2CO3. As the ionic radius increases, the radius mismatch with Zr4+ leads to a stronger ability to stabilize the tetragonal or cubic phase. At the same time, minimum dopant for stable tetragonal or cubic phases will decrease.
