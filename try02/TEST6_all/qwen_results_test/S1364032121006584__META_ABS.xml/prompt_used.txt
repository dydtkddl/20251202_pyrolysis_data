You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical conversion of agroforestry biomass and solid waste using decentralized and mobile systems for renewable energy and products Due to the rapid increase in the global demand for renewable energy and uneven, seasonal distribution of bulky biomass resources, developing decentralized and mobile biomass thermochemical conversion systems are critical, particularly to accommodate the energy needs of rural residents in developing countries and remote communities. This paper establishes the fundamental concepts of decentralized and mobile thermochemical biomass conversion systems and addresses the necessity and advantages of such systems. This article comprehensively examines the potential of various biomass and non-biomass waste streams for co-processing in such systems and summarizes the latest progress in pretreatment technologies, conversion pathways, product separation and purification, and applications. Moreover, this paper compares the designs and specifications, operation status, drawbacks, and benefits of existing systems from household to industrial-scale. It also summarizes the latest studies on the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of such systems. The key challenges in the future research and development of such systems are discussed, including systems integration and simplifications, interaction mechanism of mixed waste during co-processing, development of cost-effective catalysts, and investigation of biochar applications. Also, our recommendation is to re-visit the direct-combustion technology under a modern technological and environmental perspective. Moreover, it is necessary to promote education and training for the development of dedicated skills to support the operation and maintenance of conversion systems at secondary or higher levels.
