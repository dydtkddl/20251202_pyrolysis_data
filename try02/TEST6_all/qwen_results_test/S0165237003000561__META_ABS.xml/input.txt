Thermal recycling of polystyrene and polystyrene-butadiene dissolved in a light cycle oil A study has been made of the cracking on a mesoporous silica of polystyrene (PS) and polystyrene-butadiene (PS-BD) dissolved in a light cycle oil (LCO) from a product stream of a commercial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. This study has been carried out in a reactor of short contact time (3 s) in the 723–823 K range. This strategy for simultaneous valorization of plastics and solvent avoids the technological problems inherent to the treatment of solid postconsumer-plastics and the limitation to heat transfer in the process of pyrolysis. The cracking of plastics has a synergistic effect on the conversion of LCO, as it contributes to increasing the yield of gasoline (C5–C12). The cracking of the PS/LCO blend produces high yields of styrene, whereas the cracking of the PS-BD/LCO blend produces a stream of products with petrochemical interest.
