Study the thermal radiation effects in gas-solid flows with gray and non-gray P1 models implemented in MFiX Thermal radiation is a dominant mode of heat transfer in combustion/gasification, packed/circulating bed reactors, and energy storage/conversion devices. In hydrocarbon fuel combustion, the high absorption and emission of product gases like CO2 and H2O significantly affect the heat transfer characteristics. It is essential to understand the radiative energy propagation in such applications. In the present study, we developed a framework to implement the P-1 radiation model in MFiX for Eulerian-Eulerian (Two fluid-TFM) and Eulerian-Lagrangian (Discrete element-DEM and Particle in cell-PIC) models. The P-1 is a simplification of the spherical harmonics method. The framework has been verified on various flue gas conditions. The verified solver results are validated against the benchmark results available in the literature. The verified and validated gray and non-gray weighted sum of gray gas models is evaluated for dry and wet flue gas conditions. They are also used to study gas-solid flows in a fluidized bed/riser.
