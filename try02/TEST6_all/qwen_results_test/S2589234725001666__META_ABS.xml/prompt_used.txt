You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the synthesis methods and environmental applications of MAX phase and MXenes MXenes, a novel class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional physicochemical properties, including high electrical conductivity, tunable surface chemistry, and hydrophilicity. These features make them highly promising for environmental and energy-related applications. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of MXenes’ structural, electrical, and magnetic characteristics, along with a critical evaluation of their synthesis strategies such as etching, top-down, and bottom-up approaches, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In environmental remediation, MXenes demonstrate adsorption capacities up to 3–5 times greater than conventional materials such as activated carbon, graphene oxide, and zeolites, enabling rapid and efficient removal of heavy metal ions and organic pollutants. Their integration into membrane systems significantly reduces fouling and facilitates electrochemical regeneration, addressing key limitations in traditional wastewater treatment technologies. In energy applications, MXenes exhibit outstanding performance in electrocatalytic processes, including hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), as well as in photocatalysis and catalytic degradation. As energy storage materials, they offer high capacity and fast charge–discharge rates, particularly in lithium-ion batteries. This review also addresses major challenges, including oxidation, layer restacking, and limited scalability, while highlighting emerging solutions such as HF-free synthesis, surface functionalization, and hybrid material design. Furthermore, the integration of polymers like PVA, PEO, and PEDOT significantly enhances MXene properties, including electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and ion transport. This paper presents a detailed overview of MXenes' promise, limitations, and recent advances in environmental and energy-focused applications.
