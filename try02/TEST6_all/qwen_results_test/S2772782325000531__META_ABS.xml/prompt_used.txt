You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of microplastic and plasticizer from waterbodies; A review Environmental pollutants like microplastics and plasticizers, have emerged to become a very significant source of pollution, simply because they are persistent, ubiquitous in the environment, and toxic to many components in their environment as well as to human health. This article presents a comprehensive review on different techniques that could be used to identify and remove microplastics and plasticizers in water systems. As such, these pollutants arise from commonly used products, such as packaging, cosmetics, and synthetic fabrics, which find their way into aquatic ecosystems as wastewater or poorly managed waste. A number of detection methods are essential that run from microscopy and spectroscopic to chromatographic techniques to analyze the physical and chemical properties of microplastics. Among these innovative removal techniques, including density separation, hydrogels, coagulation, and electrocoagulation, varying efficiencies are found in isolating and degrading microplastics and plasticizers such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP). Beside that, bioremediation, advanced oxidation processes, and the application of new materials such as metal-organic framework in the removal of plasticizers are also discussed. Sustainable removal methods suitable for reasonable economic cost are presented to be developed crucially because only these can treat and reduce ecological as well as health hazards from microplastic and plasticizer contamination.
