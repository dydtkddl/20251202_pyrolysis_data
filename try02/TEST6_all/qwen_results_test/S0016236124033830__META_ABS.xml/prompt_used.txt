You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalysis and absorption behaviors of the shelled-hollow CaO-MgO microspheres on product distributions and desulfurization during waste tire fast pyrolysis Fast pyrolysis is an efficient technology in recycling waste tires (WT). However, relatively more sulfur was found in pyrolysis volatiles during WT fast pyrolysis process than slow pyrolysis, which had negative impacts on the subsequent utilization of pyrolytic products. The short volatile residence time in fast pyrolysis also caused the higher content of heavy hydrocarbon fractions in fast pyrolysis oil, reducing its added value. To improve these deficiencies, shelled-hollow CaO-MgO microsphere materials with improved textural properties were synthesized. Ca-enriched materials presented a better sulfur fixation effect compared with Mg-enriched materials. The solid-state sulfur reached up to 69.39 wt.% by the assistance of Ca85Mg15, and in turn significantly inhibited the formation of oil-S and gas-S. Meanwhile, CaO and MgO jointly catalyzed the aromatization of volatiles with a peak content of 74.56% when using Ca10Mg90. Furthermore, it is worth noting that sulfur was primarily fixed into the solid by reacting metal oxides with sulfur to form sulfide by Ca-enriched materials, while sulfur was trapped in the solid via aromatization reactions in terms of sulfur-containing organic compounds with Mg-enriched materials. These findings could provide insights for guiding the industries to minimize sulfureous volatile formation and improve the oil quality in WTs pyrolysis.
