You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Batteries and supercapacitors: An analytical perspective on electrode materials and performance challenges Energy storage devices, especially batteries and supercapacitors, are essential components in portable electronics and electric vehicles, and their role in supporting renewable energy systems is becoming increasingly critical. This review investigates their principles, types, and performance challenges, with a particular focus on energy density, power density, charge/discharge rates, and cycle life. While lithium-ion batteries are widely used for their high energy density, they face significant challenges such as long charging times, high costs, and safety concerns. Consequently, alternative battery technologies, including lithium-sulfur, lithium-air, sodium-ion, and zinc-based systems, are under active investigation. Supercapacitors, known for their rapid charge/discharge cycles and high power density, are limited by their low energy density. A key area of ongoing research is the optimization of electrode materials, such as carbon-based compounds, metal oxides, and conductive polymers, to enhance the performance of both batteries and supercapacitors. This work discusses the mechanisms of energy storage, electrode degradation, and electrolyte stability, while offering insights into future developments. It underscores the importance of distinguishing between the performance characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors to avoid misconceptions, as each technology operates on distinct principles that affect their efficiency and applications.
