You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics of catalytic glycolysis of PET wastes with sodium carbonate The kinetics of glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) wastes with ethylene glycol to give highly pure bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) was examined in a batch reactor. An excess of ethylene glycol (EG:PET molar ratio of 7.6:1) was used and the reaction was carried out in the presence of sodium carbonate as active catalyst. The influence of several operating conditions covering temperature (165–196°C), mean particle size (0.14–3mm), stirring rate (50–800rpm), reaction time (0–10h), and catalyst type and concentration was analysed. The selected PET particle size and stirring rate for kinetic calculations were 0.25mm and 600rpm, respectively. Using a PET:catalyst molar ratio of 100:1 about 80% BHET yield was attained at 196°C after 1h. A simple theoretical power-law model was developed to predict the time evolution of conversion. This kinetic model was found to be consistent with experimental data. The rate constants for both direct and reverse reactions were estimated. Also the values of the activation energy (185kJmol−1) and enthalpy of reaction (12kJmol−1) were derived.
