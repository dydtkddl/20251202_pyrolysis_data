You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of waste plastics for recovery of high-quality gasoline range hydrocarbons over nano Cu/CuO/Cu2O @Y zeolite Catalytic pyrolysis of municipal polymer waste can serve as a practical and beneficial solution to prevent the burial of plastic waste in landfills by converting them into gasoline. In this study, the key properties of gasoline, including density, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, flash point, octane number, and aniline point, were determined and compared with the standards set for gasoline. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of the produced fuel, silica-alumina in amorphous and semi-crystalline states, and zeolite Y, were used as catalysts. Additionally, a mixture of copper metal and its one and two valence oxides obtained from an organic metal framework was deposited onto a support. Ultimately, the operational temperature of the fixed-bed catalytic reactor increased from 400 to 500 °C, and for each temperature, all properties of the produced gasoline were measured and compared with standard values to determine which catalyst and at what temperature can produce gasoline capable of meeting transportation industry standards and replacing petroleum-derived gasoline. The maximum octane number for gasoline produced using a fully crystalline catalyst was measured to be 97, indicating its high quality as the most critical factor in determining gasoline quality.
