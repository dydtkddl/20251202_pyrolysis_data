You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A multidimensional numeric study on smoldering-driven pyrolysis of waste polypropylene The ex-situ smoldering driven pyrolysis reactor can simultaneously remediate the organically contaminated soil/sand and valorize the plastic waste to value-added fuels. This study establishes a multidimensional model to investigate the pyrolysis of polypropylene driven by self-sustained smoldering. The melting and decomposing processes during the pyrolysis of polypropylene have been simulated using the modified apparent heat capacity method and lumped kinetic model. Using a porous structure with high thermal conductivity in the pyrolysis domain proved to be a practical approach to address the non-uniform temperature distribution and low heating rate of plastics during pyrolysis. The research focus of this study is to obtain high-quality plastic pyrolysis liquid (oil, C6–C24) within a reasonable operating time (duration of the plastic pyrolysis process). Also, the operating conditions (Darcy air velocity, initial char concentration, and PP content) determine the yield of pyrolysis products by regulating the temperature and vapor residence time. Therefore, the sensitivity analyses of pyrolysis duration and oil yield to operating conditions have been performed. It is also found that the interface wall (between smoldering and pyrolysis chambers) heat transfer coefficient determines the smoldering chamber's thermal performance. This study provides new insights into the valorization of waste plastics and the remediation of contaminated soil/sand.
