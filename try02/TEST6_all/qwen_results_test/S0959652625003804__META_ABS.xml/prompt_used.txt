You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ sulfur fixation mechanism during microwave fluidized-bed co-pyrolysis of waste tires and biomass The disposal of waste tires (WT) presents significant environmental challenges, and microwave fluidized-bed pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution, though research remains limited. A major issue in WT pyrolysis is sulfur emission, which can be mitigated through co-pyrolysis with biomass. Co-pyrolysis between WT and two types of biomass (peanut shell (PS), Ascophyllum (AS)) was investigated, using a microwave fluidized-bed reactor, focusing on the in-situ sulfur fixation mechanism. The results show that co-pyrolysis led to higher char yield and lower gas yield than expected, with less sulfur released into the pyrolysis oil and more sulfur retained in the char. The interaction between the products of WT and biomass promoted the formation of macromolecular organic compounds, leading to an increase in aromatic hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil and inhibiting the release of sulfur-containing organic compounds. Sulfur in WT was oxidized by -OH radicals from biomass, forming solid oxygenated organic sulfur and reducing the catalytic decomposition of sulfur. Additionally, the retention of alkaline metals in biomass ash enhanced sulfur fixation. These findings suggest that microwave fluidized-bed co-pyrolysis of WT and biomass is effective in capturing sulfur and generating valuable hydrocarbons, providing a promising solution for managing urban and agricultural solid wastes sustainably.
