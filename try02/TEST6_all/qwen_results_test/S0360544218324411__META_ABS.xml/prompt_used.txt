You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical investigations of the impact of inflow conditions on characteristics of a large-scale pyrolysis unit This work is devoted to the 3D numerical study of the process of co-combustion of biomass volatiles, premixed with air, and non-premixed air-propane burner in the combustion chamber of an industrial biochar reactor. This chamber provides indirect heat for the production of biochar from wood planer shavings using a continuous feeding process running on a slat chain conveyor. A variety of inflow conditions, such as the co-injection of wood pyrolysis gases are investigated with consideration given to different excess air inlets. For each case the heat transfer rate through the plate separating the combustion chamber and the pyrolysis section is calculated and compared to the experimental configuration, which entails the combustion of propane and injection of pyrolysis gas through a large side duct. It was shown that co-injection of pyrolysis gas reduces the required propane flow rate without reducing the overall thermal energy of the unit, while maximizing the heat transfer rate between the combustion chamber and the pyrolysis section. The Finite Rate model/Eddy Dissipation model coupled with k-epsilon Realizable RANS model were used to render turbulence-chemistry interactions. Validation against experimental data published in the literature and measured in the system demonstrated reasonable agreements.
