You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced thermal activation of peroxymonosulfate by activated carbon for efficient removal of perfluorooctanoic acid The chemical degradation performance of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the environmentally persistent contaminants, by fresh activated carbon (FAC) and nitrogen-doped activated carbon (NAC) which were used as heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of thermal activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) were investigated and compared. In this study, the physicochemical properties of FAC and NAC are characterized by scanning electron microscope, Raman spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Brunauer Emmett Teller. Furthermore, the dosing amount of catalyst, the concentration of oxidant and the effect of catalytic oxidation are investigated. During the catalytic oxidation process, the concentrations of PFOA and its degradation products are determined by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The mineralization efficiency of PFOA employing FAC and NAC coupled with thermal activation of PMS are evaluated via a combination approach of total organic carbon (TOC) and ion chromatography (IC). The results indicate that PFOA can be readily degraded at 60 °C with an optimum concentration of PMS and an appropriate dosage of FAC/NAC. During the degradation process FAC and NAC exhibit superior adsorption and catalytic performance as more acidic oxygen functional groups are obtained from surface modification, which can facilitate the decomposition of PMS and the mineralization of PFOA. Electron paramagnetic resonance detection confirms that both OH and SO4 − exist during oxidation. Based on the identified products, a reaction pathway including adsorption, hydroxylation, and catalytic oxidation is proposed. The methods could not only be applied in a wide pH range to effectively remove PFOA, FAC/PMS and NAC/PMS could also be reused, which provide a feasible and cost-effective method for the degradation of PFOA in situ actual ground water remediation.
