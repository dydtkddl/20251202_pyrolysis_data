You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass-derived carbons physically activated in one or two steps for CH4/CO2 separation The present study aims at evaluating the suitability of producing activated carbons (ACs) derived from wheat straw by a one-step synthesis approach, as an alternative to more conventional two steps production processes (i.e., pyrolysis and subsequent activation). The performance of the produced ACs, in one or two steps, as sustainable and selective CO2 adsorbents for CH4/CO2 separation is compared. In addition, the influence of pyrolysis conditions on the properties of the resulting two-step ACs is carefully analyzed. We show that the biochar-based precursors of ACs presenting the best textural properties were obtained under mild conditions of maximum temperature and absolute pressure during pyrolysis. The one-step ACs were fully comparable —in terms of textural properties as well as CO2 uptake and selectivity— to those produced by the more conventional two-step synthesis process. In addition, results obtained from breakthrough curve simulations highlight that the best AC in terms of CH4 recovery under dynamic conditions was produced by a one-step activation. Therefore, the one-step process appears to be as an attractive route for the production of engineered carbon materials, which can lead to significant cost savings in large-scale production systems.
