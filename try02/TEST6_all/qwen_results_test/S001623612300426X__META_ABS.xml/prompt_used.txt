You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particle-scale investigation of oxy-fuel combustion in a pressurized fluidized bed A CFD-DEM model that includes chemical reactions such as fuel pyrolysis, combustion, gasification, volatile combustion, and the formation and reduction of gaseous pollutants was developed in the open-source MFIX. The extended model was validated at particle and reactor scales by comparison with experimental data. Subsequently, the model was applied to study the oxy-fuel combustion in a pressurized fluidized bed operating at varied pressures between 0.2 MPa and 0.8 MPa and O2 concentrations between 30 % and 50 %, yielding abundant particle-scale information. The results revealed that fuel combustion is positively impacted by volatile combustion. Raising the pressure or the O2 concentration, especially the pressure, enhances the combustion rate and temperature of fuel particles. The heat transfer of fuel particles during stable combustion is dominated by the reaction heat, followed by the convection heat, radiation heat, and particle–wall conduction heat, while heat conduction between particles can be safely ignored due to its small contribution. The heat and mass transfer of fuel particles is greatly improved under higher operating pressures but insignificantly affected by the O2 concentration of the combustion medium.
