  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on oxy-fuel combustion in a pressurized fluidized bed, involving fuel pyrolysis as part of a combustion process, but the feedstock is not waste plastic or commercial plastic; the abstract lacks any mention of plastic or polymer pyrolysis as the primary focus, and the experimental data pertains to combustion and heat transfer, not plastic pyrolysis product yields or characterization."
