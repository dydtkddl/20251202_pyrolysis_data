You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste type, incineration, and aeration are associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl levels in landfill leachates Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are found in many consumer products which will be ultimately disposed in landfills. Limiting environmental contamination and future exposures will require managing leachates from different types of landfills, each with different PFAS levels depending upon the source of the waste. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of waste type and on-site treatment on PFAS levels in landfill leachates. Eleven PFAS species (7 carboxylic acids, 3 sulfonic acids, and 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid) were evaluated in leachates from municipal solid waste (MSW), construction and demolition (C&D), MSW ash (MSWA), and a mixture of MSWA and MSW with landfill gas condensate (MSWA/MSW-GC). Leachates were also analyzed before and after on-site treatment at two of these facilities. Results indicate that MSWA leachate had significantly lower PFAS levels relative to other leachate types. Lower total PFAS concentrations in MSWA leachates were correlated with an increase in incineration temperature (R2 = 0.92, p = 0.008). The levels of PFAS in untreated C&D and untreated MSW leachate were similar. The levels of targeted PFAS species in MSW leachate for one of the facilities evaluated increased after on-site landfill treatment presumably due to the conversion of PFAS precursors in the untreated leachate sample.
