Recent advance in research on halloysite nanotubes-polymer nanocomposite Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are novel 1D natural nanomaterials with predominantly hollow tubular nanostructures and high aspect ratios. Due to their high mechanical strength, thermal stability, biocompatibility, and abundance, HNTs have a number of exciting potential applications in polymer nanocomposites. In this article, we review the recent progress toward the development of HNTs-polymer nanocomposites, while paying particular attention to interfacial interactions of the nanocomposites. The characteristics of the HNTs relative to the formation of the polymer nanocomposites are summarized first. The covalent or non-covalent functionalization methods for HNTs and various fabrication approaches for HNTs-polymer nanocomposites are introduced afterward. Polymer nanocomposites reinforced with HNTs possess highly increased tensile and flexural strength, elastic moduli, and improved toughness. HNTs-polymer nanocomposites also exhibit elevated thermal resistance, flame retardance and unique crystallization behavior. Due to the tubular microstructure and the biocompatibility of HNTs, HNTs-polymer nanocomposites have demonstrated good drug encapsulation and sustained release abilities, gaining them extensive use as tissue engineering scaffolds and drug carriers. Finally, we summarize the characteristics of HNTs-polymer nanocomposites and predict for the development of the potential applications in high-performance composites for aircraft/automobile industries, environmental protection, and biomaterials.
