You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advance in research on halloysite nanotubes-polymer nanocomposite Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are novel 1D natural nanomaterials with predominantly hollow tubular nanostructures and high aspect ratios. Due to their high mechanical strength, thermal stability, biocompatibility, and abundance, HNTs have a number of exciting potential applications in polymer nanocomposites. In this article, we review the recent progress toward the development of HNTs-polymer nanocomposites, while paying particular attention to interfacial interactions of the nanocomposites. The characteristics of the HNTs relative to the formation of the polymer nanocomposites are summarized first. The covalent or non-covalent functionalization methods for HNTs and various fabrication approaches for HNTs-polymer nanocomposites are introduced afterward. Polymer nanocomposites reinforced with HNTs possess highly increased tensile and flexural strength, elastic moduli, and improved toughness. HNTs-polymer nanocomposites also exhibit elevated thermal resistance, flame retardance and unique crystallization behavior. Due to the tubular microstructure and the biocompatibility of HNTs, HNTs-polymer nanocomposites have demonstrated good drug encapsulation and sustained release abilities, gaining them extensive use as tissue engineering scaffolds and drug carriers. Finally, we summarize the characteristics of HNTs-polymer nanocomposites and predict for the development of the potential applications in high-performance composites for aircraft/automobile industries, environmental protection, and biomaterials.
