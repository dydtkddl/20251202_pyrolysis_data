You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pore size control and gas permeation kinetics of silica membranes by pyrolysis of phenyl-substituted ethoxysilanes with cross-flow through a porous support wall A silica membrane was produced by chemical vapor deposition using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) or diphenyldiethoxysilane (DPDES) as the Si source. Amorphous silica was deposited in the mesopores of a γ-alumina film coated on a porous α-alumina tube, by evacuating the reactant through the porous wall. Hydrogen permeance at a permeation temperature of 600°C was of the order of 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1, and was not greatly dependent on the Si sources. The silica membrane produced using TEOS contained micropores permeable to both helium and hydrogen, but CO2 and larger molecules were only slightly permeated through those mesopores which were left unplugged. The silica membrane produced from DPDES showed a single-component CO2 permeance equivalent to that of single-component He, and CO 2 N 2 selectivity was approximately 9 at a permeation temperature of 30°C. When a mixture of CO2 and N2 was fed, however, CO2 permeance decreased to the level of N2 permeance. The H 2 N 2 selectivity, determined from single-component permeances to H2 and N2, was approximately 100, and these permeances remained unchanged when an equimolar mixture of H2 and N2 was fed. Thus, the DPDES-derived membrane possessed two types of micropores, abundant pores through which helium and hydrogen permeated and a small number of pores in which molecules of CO2 and N2 were permeable but not able to pass one another. Neither meso or macropores remained in the DPDES membrane.
