You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recyclable magnetic waste tyre activated carbon-chitosan composite as an effective adsorbent rapid and simultaneous removal of methylparaben and propylparaben from aqueous solution and wastewater A recyclable magnetic waste tyre activated carbon-chitosan composite was synthesized as a suitable adsorbent material in the adsorptive parabens removal from model solutions and real wastewater samples. Characterization techniques such as, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of adsorbent material. The results of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller isotherms showed that the adsorbent has a specific surface area of 1281 m2 g−1 and pore size of 4.05 nm. These results offer relatively high adsorption capacity for the parabens. Under optimised conditions, kinetics results demonstrated that the adsorption fitted the pseudo-second-kinetic model. While, the simultaneous adsorption of methylparaben and propylparaben was described better by Langmuir and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity for monolayer adsorption from the Langmuir model as 85.9 mg.g−1 and 90.0 mg.g−1 for methylparaben and propylparaben, respectively. It was observed that the composite was stable after seven cycles of adsorption-desorption with obvious loss of adsorption efficiency (>95%). Therefore, it was concluded that as-prepared composite had considerable reusability properties which could make it a cost-effective adsorbent for the removal of parabens from various media. Furthermore, the eco-friendly and cost-effective magnetic adsorbent was used for remediation of parabens from wastewater samples and up to 100% removal was achieved.
