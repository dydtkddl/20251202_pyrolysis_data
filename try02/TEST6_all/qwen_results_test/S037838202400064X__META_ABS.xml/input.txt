Green catalyst innovation: Enhanced Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using potassium-promoted cobalt catalysts supported on pyrolyzed peanut shells and Cladophora Glomerata modified biochars This paper explores pyrolysis potential for effective modified biochar (MB) production, serving as a green and novel carbon-based catalyst support in Fischer-Tropsch to olefins synthesis. For this purpose, the MB produced from the pyrolysis of pre-treated Peanut shell (PS) and Cladophora glomerata algae (CG) was used as a high porosity support for cobalt catalyst synthesis. The impregnation technique was applied to prepare the cobalt catalysts, and the catalysts were promoted with potassium. Various methods examine catalysts physico-chemical properties. After 10 h of reduction at 400 °C, the catalysts' activity and selectivity were studied in a fixed-bed reactor. TEM images show that the metal particles are suitably distributed on the porous surface of the modified biochars. The majority of the particles were between 5 and 15 nm in size. Also, TPR results indicate a suitable metal dispersion of about 10% and good catalyst reducibility have been achieved. The cobalt catalysts produced on MBs of CG and PS exhibited FT rates of 0.245 and 0.223 (g HC/g cat.h), with CO conversion rates of 50.25% and 45.68% in each case. Finally, K-promoted cobalt catalysts supported on MBs of CG and PS showed the α-olefins selectivities of 38.67% and 35.49% for C2-C13 hydrocarbons, respectively.
