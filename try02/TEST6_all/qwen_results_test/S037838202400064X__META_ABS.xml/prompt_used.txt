You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green catalyst innovation: Enhanced Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using potassium-promoted cobalt catalysts supported on pyrolyzed peanut shells and Cladophora Glomerata modified biochars This paper explores pyrolysis potential for effective modified biochar (MB) production, serving as a green and novel carbon-based catalyst support in Fischer-Tropsch to olefins synthesis. For this purpose, the MB produced from the pyrolysis of pre-treated Peanut shell (PS) and Cladophora glomerata algae (CG) was used as a high porosity support for cobalt catalyst synthesis. The impregnation technique was applied to prepare the cobalt catalysts, and the catalysts were promoted with potassium. Various methods examine catalysts physico-chemical properties. After 10 h of reduction at 400 °C, the catalysts' activity and selectivity were studied in a fixed-bed reactor. TEM images show that the metal particles are suitably distributed on the porous surface of the modified biochars. The majority of the particles were between 5 and 15 nm in size. Also, TPR results indicate a suitable metal dispersion of about 10% and good catalyst reducibility have been achieved. The cobalt catalysts produced on MBs of CG and PS exhibited FT rates of 0.245 and 0.223 (g HC/g cat.h), with CO conversion rates of 50.25% and 45.68% in each case. Finally, K-promoted cobalt catalysts supported on MBs of CG and PS showed the α-olefins selectivities of 38.67% and 35.49% for C2-C13 hydrocarbons, respectively.
