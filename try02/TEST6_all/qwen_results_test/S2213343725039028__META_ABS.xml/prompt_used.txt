You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct production and characterization of carbon black from organic hazardous wastes via high temperature pyrolysis and volatiles condensation This study investigated the production of carbon black from various organic hazardous wastes (OHWs)—including oil sludge (OS), paint sludge (PS), and penicillin fermentation residue (PFR)—using high temperature pyrolysis and volatile condensation. The influences of feedstock properties and reaction temperature on the yield and physicochemical characteristics of the resulting CB were systematically evaluated. Pyrolysis of OS, PS, and PFR produced CB in yields of 1.34.0 %, 11.525.1 %, and 4.813.0 %, with corresponding carbon conversion efficiencies of 13.843.8 %, 16.637.8 %, and 9.125.8 %, respectively. OS, characterized by its high content of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, exhibits a greater tendency to form CB compared to PS and PFR. Reaction temperature exhibited a significant influence on both the carbon content and particle size distribution of CB. In addition, the CB samples from OS and PS pyrolyzed above 1200 °C exhibited similar C content (>96 %) and layer interplanar spacing (0.3590.366 nm) to some commercial products. This work highlights a potentially treatment method and resource recovery route for OHWs.
