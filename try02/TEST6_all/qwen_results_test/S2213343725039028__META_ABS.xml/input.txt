Direct production and characterization of carbon black from organic hazardous wastes via high temperature pyrolysis and volatiles condensation This study investigated the production of carbon black from various organic hazardous wastes (OHWs)—including oil sludge (OS), paint sludge (PS), and penicillin fermentation residue (PFR)—using high temperature pyrolysis and volatile condensation. The influences of feedstock properties and reaction temperature on the yield and physicochemical characteristics of the resulting CB were systematically evaluated. Pyrolysis of OS, PS, and PFR produced CB in yields of 1.34.0 %, 11.525.1 %, and 4.813.0 %, with corresponding carbon conversion efficiencies of 13.843.8 %, 16.637.8 %, and 9.125.8 %, respectively. OS, characterized by its high content of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, exhibits a greater tendency to form CB compared to PS and PFR. Reaction temperature exhibited a significant influence on both the carbon content and particle size distribution of CB. In addition, the CB samples from OS and PS pyrolyzed above 1200 °C exhibited similar C content (>96 %) and layer interplanar spacing (0.3590.366 nm) to some commercial products. This work highlights a potentially treatment method and resource recovery route for OHWs.
