You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of volatiles on properties of char during sequential pyrolysis of PET and cellulose Interaction of the volatiles in co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass is known to affect properties of pyrolysis products. Nevertheless, in co-pyrolysis, except the interaction between the volatiles, the volatiles could also interact with the char of same or different origin. Thus, understanding the specific effects of the volatiles of plastics/biomass on the evolution of the char from biomass/plastics is difficult. Hence, the investigation of the sequential pyrolysis of cellulose and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 600 °C was to explore the specific influences of volatiles from cellulose/PET in upper bed on the property of the char from PET/cellulose in lower bed. During sequential pyrolysis with cellulose in upper bed, the cellulose-derived oxygen-rich radicals promoted the cracking of the organic component on the PET-derived char, which significantly reduced the char yield while promoted the formation of heavy organics products and reduced hydrophobicity of the PET-derived char. Additionally, the cellulose-derived volatiles (e.g. ketones and aldehydes) involved in the secondary polymerization reactions with the volatiles from PET, forming more phenolics. PET-derived hydrocarbon-rich molecules did not promote charring reactions of the cellulose-derived char but increased hydrophobicity of the cellulose-char. Moreover, the varied interaction of the volatiles also significantly impacted thermal stability of the functional groups of char.
