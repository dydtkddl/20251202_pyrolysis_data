You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of hemicellulose to xylooligosaccharides: New insights into the influence of impregnation solvent Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of lignocellulose constitutes a new frontier in bioreﬁnery. In this study, a weak alkali-oxidation pretreatment with sodium percarbonate was employed to isolate hemicellulose from corncob, which was comprehensively characterized by FTIR, 1H, 13C, and 2D HSQC NMR. The influences of impregnation solvent, the type and dosage of acid catalyst, and ball-milling time on the mechanocatalytic depolymerization of hemicellulose have been systematically investigated. A mathematical model based on Kamlet-Taft parameters was first proposed to reveal the relationship between the reaction conversion and the solvent properties, and the results suggested a solvent possessing a high polarity/polarizability and Lewis basicity is favorable for the reaction. Under the optimal conditions, 97.1% conversion of hemicellulose with 93.1% selectivity of xylooligosaccharides based on xylans could be achieved within 2 h. Qualitative high-resolution ESI-MS and quantitative HPAEC analysis demonstrated the good solubility of the obtained xylooligosaccharides was ascribed to the depolymerization of hemicellulose rather than the formation of sulfonated oligosaccharides.
