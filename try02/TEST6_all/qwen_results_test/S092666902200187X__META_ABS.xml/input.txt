Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of hemicellulose to xylooligosaccharides: New insights into the influence of impregnation solvent Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of lignocellulose constitutes a new frontier in bioreﬁnery. In this study, a weak alkali-oxidation pretreatment with sodium percarbonate was employed to isolate hemicellulose from corncob, which was comprehensively characterized by FTIR, 1H, 13C, and 2D HSQC NMR. The influences of impregnation solvent, the type and dosage of acid catalyst, and ball-milling time on the mechanocatalytic depolymerization of hemicellulose have been systematically investigated. A mathematical model based on Kamlet-Taft parameters was first proposed to reveal the relationship between the reaction conversion and the solvent properties, and the results suggested a solvent possessing a high polarity/polarizability and Lewis basicity is favorable for the reaction. Under the optimal conditions, 97.1% conversion of hemicellulose with 93.1% selectivity of xylooligosaccharides based on xylans could be achieved within 2 h. Qualitative high-resolution ESI-MS and quantitative HPAEC analysis demonstrated the good solubility of the obtained xylooligosaccharides was ascribed to the depolymerization of hemicellulose rather than the formation of sulfonated oligosaccharides.
