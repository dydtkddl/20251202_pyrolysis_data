You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hierarchically structured Fe-Cu-Ni-O@Al2O3-ZrO2 monolithic oxygen carrier for efficient chemical looping hydrogen production Chemical looping hydrogen generation (CLHG) emerges as a promising method for generating high-purity hydrogen (H2) and capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) in a ready-to-use form, with a minimal energy penalty in comparison with conventional routes using fossil fuels reforming. However, conventional pellet-packed bed reactors encounter several challenges, including high pressure drops and limitations in heat and mass transfer efficiency. In this work, we prepared a hierarchically structured Fe-Cu-Ni-O@Al2O3-ZrO2 monolithic oxygen carrier (OC) using the phase inversion extrusion method. The redox performance of this monolithic OC is systematically evaluated in the CLHG process, as compared to the conventional pellet-packed bed reactor. Results showed that the monolithic OC, with its adjustable axial macro-channels and numerous radial microchannels, significantly reduces mass transfer resistance and provides increased geometric surface area. This design led to enhanced redox reactivity, improved stability, and greater resistance to carbon deposition compared to granular OCs. The monolithic OC also achieved higher fuel conversion efficiency, characterized by a shorter induction period, a more rapid attainment of peak real-time CO2 purity, and a higher minimum value of real-time CO2 purity during the OC reduction process. Furthermore, the monolithic OC achieved an impressive H2 yield of 15.28 mmol·g−1 Fe2O3 and a H2 production rate of 0.24 mmol·s−1·g−1 Fe2O3, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the granular OC. In addition, the monolithic OC showed excellent cyclic stability over 20 cycles, in contrast to the rapid deactivation of granular OCs due to severe phase segregation.
