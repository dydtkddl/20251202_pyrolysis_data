Hierarchically structured Fe-Cu-Ni-O@Al2O3-ZrO2 monolithic oxygen carrier for efficient chemical looping hydrogen production Chemical looping hydrogen generation (CLHG) emerges as a promising method for generating high-purity hydrogen (H2) and capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) in a ready-to-use form, with a minimal energy penalty in comparison with conventional routes using fossil fuels reforming. However, conventional pellet-packed bed reactors encounter several challenges, including high pressure drops and limitations in heat and mass transfer efficiency. In this work, we prepared a hierarchically structured Fe-Cu-Ni-O@Al2O3-ZrO2 monolithic oxygen carrier (OC) using the phase inversion extrusion method. The redox performance of this monolithic OC is systematically evaluated in the CLHG process, as compared to the conventional pellet-packed bed reactor. Results showed that the monolithic OC, with its adjustable axial macro-channels and numerous radial microchannels, significantly reduces mass transfer resistance and provides increased geometric surface area. This design led to enhanced redox reactivity, improved stability, and greater resistance to carbon deposition compared to granular OCs. The monolithic OC also achieved higher fuel conversion efficiency, characterized by a shorter induction period, a more rapid attainment of peak real-time CO2 purity, and a higher minimum value of real-time CO2 purity during the OC reduction process. Furthermore, the monolithic OC achieved an impressive H2 yield of 15.28 mmol·g−1 Fe2O3 and a H2 production rate of 0.24 mmol·s−1·g−1 Fe2O3, which is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the granular OC. In addition, the monolithic OC showed excellent cyclic stability over 20 cycles, in contrast to the rapid deactivation of granular OCs due to severe phase segregation.
