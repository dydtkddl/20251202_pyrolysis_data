You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of Chinese herb residue and polypropylene over Ni, Fe, Co and Cu/AC: Co-production and formation mechanism of carbon nanomaterials, liquid oil and pyrolysis gas The preparation of high-value fuels and carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) by co-pyrolysis of Chinese herb residue (CHR) and polypropylene (PP) is conducive to the improvement of environment and energy problems. The effect of monometallic (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu) and bimetallic (Ni/Fe, Ni/Co, Ni/Cu) loaded on activated carbon (AC) catalysts on the pyrolysis products was investigated in a two-stage fixed bed. The results showed that the synergistic effect of bimetals improved the quality of pyrolysis products. In particular, NiCo/AC significantly promoted the removal of F and improved the quality of liquid oil. Moreover, the content of over C20 in the Ni/Co group was the lowest, indicating that the secondary cracking of macromolecules was promoted. NiCo/AC also improved the yield and quality of pyrolysis gas. The content of H2 in Ni/Co group increased to 27.82%. In addition, Ni/Co group had the highest yield (more than 4 times that of blank group) and quality (ID/IG = 1.019) of CNMs. The pyrolysis gas obtained from different front-end catalytic has a great influence on the formation of back-end CNMs. The high CH4 promoted the formation of CNMs. A unique 3D graphitic carbon (GC) network was finally formed in high temperature.
