You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste materials conversion into mesoporous silicon carbide nanocermics: Nanofibre/particle mixture This study confirms a sustainable and clean new approach for synthesizing a mesoporous silicon carbide (SiC) nanofibre/particle composite from a binary mixture of two problematic, high volume global waste streams, e-waste glass (SiO2 source) and waste tyre rubber (WTR) through the carbothermal reduction. The resulting composite material consisted of a mixture of nanofibres of 10–150 nm diameters and over 5 microns length, and distributed nanoparticles with particle size ranging between 30 and 40 nm with a relatively high surface area (85.1–67.3 m2 g−1) and a dominant pore size smaller than 2 nm. SiC of nanomaterials is conventionally fabricated from high quality carbon and silicon sources which are expensive and may not prove cost effective from industrial perspective. E-waste glass and waste tyres are both potential sources of valuable secondary resources, but a lack of cost-effective recycling options means vast volumes are landfilled, stockpiled or diverted to unsafe processing operations in developing countries; posing serious environmental and health risks. The simultaneous conversion of two globally significant waste burdens into (SiC) nanofibre/particle composite has not previously been investigated. This novel approach highlights the opportunities for utilizing waste as an alternative resource to deliver economic and environmental benefits and also demonstrates a new low cost means of synthesizing SiC nanofibre/particle composite.
