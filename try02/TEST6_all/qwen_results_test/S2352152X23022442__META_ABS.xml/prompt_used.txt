You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of carbon nanotube-based metal oxide nanocomposites for supercapacitors Energy storage is one of the challenging technical issues for the society to the transition to renewable energy. Effective energy storage devices are typically added to balance supply and demand to facilitate this firming of renewable energy. Supercapacitor will be a great choice for energy storage as well as electrochemical phenomena for its high-power density and stable retention rate with a wide range of cycling numbers. Carbon nanotube (CNT) and metal-based composites has some unique properties which are distinguishable from others, for instance, the superior electrochemical interaction of the metal oxides with the CNTs, the establishment of a highly porous 3-dimensional framework through CNT entanglement, that further allows the rapid and efficient movement of ions to the productive surfaces of the elements of the nanocomposite, and the elevated strength of CNT@metal oxides. This review discusses how the electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (SPc), energy density, power density, and the number of cycle capacitance retention changes after introducing different kinds of metal oxide with CNTs. However, nanocomposites with different materials have demonstrated high power density but low energy density known as pseudocapacitance behavior. Therefore, present challenges and prospects and where upcoming research has to be focused are discussed here.
