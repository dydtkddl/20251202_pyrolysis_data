You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Feasibility of nanomaterial tungsten carbide as lead-free nanomaterial-based radiation shielding Radiation shielding material is essential to protect humans and the environment from direct exposure to ionizing radiation. The ionizing radiation is best absorbed by high-density materials and heavy atoms like lead. The drawback of lead is that it is toxic, heavy, non-transparent, and bulky, which are often undesirable features for most applications. As a result, while the development of nanomaterials as radiation shielding materials is a promising field of study, a complete evaluation of the application of tungsten carbide nanofilm as a lead-free shielding material is still lacking in the literature. Tungsten carbide is an attractive material because it can be formed into a film using various fabrication processes suitable for a wide range of substrates. Moreover, tungsten carbide has a high atomic number, greater density, and better shielding characteristics compared to lead. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to provide recent advancements in the physical properties of tungsten carbide, the application of tungsten carbide nanofilm as radiation shielding material, and an overview of thin film deposition and deposition techniques that include the morphological structure of tungsten carbide nanofilm. The key challenges and future direction are also discussed.
