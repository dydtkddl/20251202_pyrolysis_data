You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic insights into the mild reductive depolymerization of hydrolysis lignin: effects of catalyst, temperature and reaction time The valorization of lignin via mild reductive depolymerization has gained increasing interest, but various knowledge gaps regarding the underlying reaction mechanism continue to hinder the rational optimization of the process conditions. In order to fill these gaps, this work investigates both solvolytic and catalytic mild reductive depolymerization of a hydrolysis lignin at different reaction times (15 min – 10 h) and temperatures (150 °C – 200 °C). Novel insights into the depolymerization of (technical) lignins were achieved by investigating the modification of native end groups (NEGs), defined as para-substituted side chains attached to the end of the lignin polymers before depolymerization such as formyl and 3-oxo-1-propenyl. These were found to be stable in solvolysis but highly reactive in catalysis with Pd/γ-Al2O3. Furthermore, this work introduces a new catalytic reaction mechanism, whereby β-O-4-derived propanol side chains are converted into ethyl side chains at elevated temperatures. At 150 °C, these propanol groups remained largely intact, whereas at 200 °C, up to 40 % were transformed into ethyl chains. The findings further highlight distinctive depolymerization pathways for solvolysis and catalysis. Solvolysis proceeds via a “peeling-off” mechanism, while catalysis involves random cleavage of β-O-4 linkages. This results in a higher degree of depolymerization and monomer yield under catalytic conditions (up to 9 wt% compared to approximately 3 wt% for solvolysis). In both cases, the majority of depolymerization occurs within the first 3 h of reaction. Finally, it was proven that the Pd catalyst plays a primordial role in the modification of β-β and β-5 linkages, which remain stable under solvolytic conditions.
