Batch and semi-continuous synthesis of magnesium oxide powders from hydrolysis and supercritical treatment of Mg(OCH3)2 A new process for submicronic MgO powder synthesis starting with Mg(OCH3)2 is studied. The influence of various experimental parameters (water to alkoxide ratio, temperature, reaction time) is investigated. Aerogels and crystallized MgO powders with surface area up to 280 and 210 m2 · g−1 have been obtained in batch and semi-continuous reactors, respectively.
