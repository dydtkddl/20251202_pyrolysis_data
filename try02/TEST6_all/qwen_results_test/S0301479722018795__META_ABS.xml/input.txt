Insight into the removal of vanadium ions from model and real wastewaters using surface grafted zirconia-based adsorbents: Batch experiments, equilibrium and mechanism study This study concerns the fabrication of CTAB- and N,N-dimethyltetradecylamine-grafted zirconia and evaluation of their ability to adsorb vanadium ions. The effectiveness of ZrO2 functionalization and the different nature of the modifiers used were confirmed by differences in the porosity (ZrO2: SBET = 347 m2/g; ZrO2-CTAB: SBET = 375 m2/g, ZrO2–NH+: SBET = 155 m2/g), types of functional groups, and isoelectric points (the ZrO2 and CTAB-modified samples have IEPs = 3.8 and 3.9, ZrO2–NH+ has IEP = 7.1) of the prepared adsorbents. The designed materials were tested in batch adsorption experiments involving the removal of vanadium ions from model wastewaters at various process parameters, among which pH proved to be the most important. Based on equilibrium and kinetic evaluations, it was proved that the sorption of V(V) ions followed pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion models, and the data were better fitted to the Langmuir model, suggesting the following order of the sorbents in terms of favorability for V(V) ion adsorption: ZrO2–NH+ > ZrO2 > ZrO2-CTAB. The estimated maximum monolayer capacity of ZrO2–NH+ for V(V) (87.72 mg/g) was the highest among the tested materials. Additionally, it was confirmed that adsorption of V(V) ions onto synthesized materials is a heterogeneous, exothermic, and spontaneous reaction, as evidenced by the calculated values of thermodynamic parameters. The key goals included the transfer of experimental findings obtained using model solutions to the adsorption of V(V) ions from solutions arising from the leaching process of spent catalysts. The highest adsorption efficiencies of 70.8% and 47.5% were recorded for the ZrO2–NH+ material in acidic solution; this may be related to the protonization of –NH+ groups, which favors the sorption of V(V) ions. Based on desorption tests as well as the results of infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, irrespective of the process conditions, the physical nature of the adsorbent/adsorbate interaction was confirmed.
