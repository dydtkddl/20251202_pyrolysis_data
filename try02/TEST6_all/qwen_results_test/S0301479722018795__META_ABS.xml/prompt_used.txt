You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the removal of vanadium ions from model and real wastewaters using surface grafted zirconia-based adsorbents: Batch experiments, equilibrium and mechanism study This study concerns the fabrication of CTAB- and N,N-dimethyltetradecylamine-grafted zirconia and evaluation of their ability to adsorb vanadium ions. The effectiveness of ZrO2 functionalization and the different nature of the modifiers used were confirmed by differences in the porosity (ZrO2: SBET = 347 m2/g; ZrO2-CTAB: SBET = 375 m2/g, ZrO2–NH+: SBET = 155 m2/g), types of functional groups, and isoelectric points (the ZrO2 and CTAB-modified samples have IEPs = 3.8 and 3.9, ZrO2–NH+ has IEP = 7.1) of the prepared adsorbents. The designed materials were tested in batch adsorption experiments involving the removal of vanadium ions from model wastewaters at various process parameters, among which pH proved to be the most important. Based on equilibrium and kinetic evaluations, it was proved that the sorption of V(V) ions followed pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion models, and the data were better fitted to the Langmuir model, suggesting the following order of the sorbents in terms of favorability for V(V) ion adsorption: ZrO2–NH+ > ZrO2 > ZrO2-CTAB. The estimated maximum monolayer capacity of ZrO2–NH+ for V(V) (87.72 mg/g) was the highest among the tested materials. Additionally, it was confirmed that adsorption of V(V) ions onto synthesized materials is a heterogeneous, exothermic, and spontaneous reaction, as evidenced by the calculated values of thermodynamic parameters. The key goals included the transfer of experimental findings obtained using model solutions to the adsorption of V(V) ions from solutions arising from the leaching process of spent catalysts. The highest adsorption efficiencies of 70.8% and 47.5% were recorded for the ZrO2–NH+ material in acidic solution; this may be related to the protonization of –NH+ groups, which favors the sorption of V(V) ions. Based on desorption tests as well as the results of infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, irrespective of the process conditions, the physical nature of the adsorbent/adsorbate interaction was confirmed.
