Effect of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) on CO2-assisted thermochemical conversion of oxygen-free plastics Carbon dioxide (CO2)-assisted thermal conversion of C-containing wastes can bring synergistic effect of CO2 reduction/consumption and valuable resources (e.g., syngas) recovery of from the wastes, and provide a solid option for the sustainable treatment. In this study, the effects of iron oxides on CO2-assisted pyrolysis of oxygen-free plastics (polyethylene, PE) for syngas generation were investigated. Without the addition of iron oxides, no notable CO production was observed during CO2-assisted PE pyrolysis (non-isothermal zone of 200–700 °C for 50 min, followed by isothermal zone of 700 °C). Compared with the CO2-assisted thermochemical conversion of PE in the presence of Fe3O4 at a mass ratio of 1:1 (0.3 mol% H2 and 0.6 mol% CO), syngas generation by γ-Fe2O3 at the same mass ratio (0.6 mol% H2 and 2.5 mol% CO) is enhanced at a maximum temperature of 700 °C due to the higher surface reducibility, which facilitates a larger amount of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. In conclusion, iron oxides with high oxidation states are promising catalysts for the production of CO-rich syngas during CO2-assisted pyrolysis of oxygen-free plastics.
