You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of nacre-inspired materials: Chemistry, strengthening-deformation mechanism, synthesis, and applications Biomimetic material development takes inspiration from biological materials and organisms that possess extraordinary properties or appearance, such as excellent mechanical strength and toughness, self-cleaning, self-healing, brilliant colours, etc., to develop materials and products with advanced capabilities. One such remarkable inspiring source is nacre which forms the inner layer of shells and is commonly known as the mother of pearls. Nacre consists of 95 vol% brittle inorganic minerals (CaCO3), and 5% organic polymers as the brick-and-mortar structure, yet exhibits a work of fracture that is ca. 3000 times higher than that of pure constituent minerals. Mimicking nacre, an ideal combination of high strength, and high fracture toughness, paves the way for the production of alternative, sustainable high performance, structural and functional materials. Recent research advances have led to the fabrication of nacre-inspired hierarchical structured fibres, films, and bulk composite materials. This review discusses the chemistry of nacre formation, the details of brick-and-mortar structure, and the strengthening and deformation mechanism. Furthermore, we present a broad overview of recent trends and developments in synthesis processes and applications of nacre-inspired materials. We put emphasis on hierarchical composites with a brief discussion on artificial carbonates synthesized by mimicking the natural formation of nacre.
