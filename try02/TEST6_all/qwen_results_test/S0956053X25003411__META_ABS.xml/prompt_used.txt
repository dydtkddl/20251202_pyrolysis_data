You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastic contamination in different aged landfill mineralization Domestic landfills function as both significant sinks and sources of microplastics (MPs). Inadequate management and re-excavation of landfill mineralized refuse can lead to the release of these emerging contaminants into the surrounding environment, resulting in secondary pollution. Therefore, systematic risk assessments of MPs in landfills are crucial for understanding their environmental impact and informing mitigation strategies. This research investigated three landfills in economically diverse regions of Southeast China, including two sanitary landfills and one informal dump site. A uniform sampling and analytical approach, including solvent extraction and pyrolysis–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), was applied to quantify mixed MPs of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) across 68 mineralized refuse samples. The average MPs concentrations in the three landfills ranged from 0.44 to 1.56 g/ (kg mineralized refuse by mass), and 0.105 to 0.397 g/ (m3 mineralized refuse by volume). Sanitary landfills contained higher MPs levels due to prolonged degradation under harsh landfill conditions. However, despite its older landfill age, the dump site exhibited lower MPs concentrations but a higher diffusion threat due to the lack of effective preventive measures. This research demonstrated that MPs contamination risk was also driven by landfill age and regional economic status. These findings provide a quantitative basis for assessing MPs pollution in landfills and emphasize the need for targeted strategies to mitigate MPs release into the environment.
