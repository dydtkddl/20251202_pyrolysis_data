You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste‑to‑hydrogen technologies: Advances in catalytic, thermochemical, and biochemical conversion pathways for a circular hydrogen economy The evolution towards a circular hydrogen economy requires the deployment of sophisticated technologies capable of transforming various waste streams into high-purity hydrogen while minimizing environmental impacts. This review presents a comprehensive evaluation of recent advancements in catalytic, thermochemical, and biochemical methodologies, highlighting their operational efficacy, techno-economic viability, and environmental sustainability. Catalytic methodologies, including nanostructured, photocatalytic, and electrocatalytic systems, have achieved hydrogen production rates of 100–250 mL H₂ g⁻¹ h⁻¹ with Faradaic efficiencies of 80–90 %. However, obstacles such as catalyst deactivation and scalability issues persist. Thermochemical methodologies, encompassing pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma-assisted reforming, generate syngas comprising 20–55 vol% H₂ with energy demands of 0.6–0.8 mol H₂ kWh⁻¹; however, they necessitate trade-offs between capital intensity and operational expenses. Biochemical techniques, such as dark fermentation (DF), photofermentation (PF), and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs), exhibit yields of 2–6 mol H₂ mol⁻¹ substrate under moderate conditions, with potential for co-product valorization, yet constrained by sluggish kinetics and pretreatment requirements. Comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) suggest that hybrid systems amalgamating thermochemical and biochemical pathways can achieve costs as low as 1.8–2.5 USD kg⁻¹ H₂ and lifecycle emissions below 2 kg CO₂ kg⁻¹ H₂, thereby surpassing single-process configurations.
