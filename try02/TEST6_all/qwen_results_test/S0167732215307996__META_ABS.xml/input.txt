Removal of organic pollutants from aqueous solution using agricultural wastes: A review Among various wastewater treatment techniques, adsorption is supposed as one of the best methods due to its inexpensiveness, universal nature and ease of operation. Then, the use of agricultural waste for organic pollutants adsorption from aqueous solution has been reviewed. This article focuses on the preparation of activated carbon through various agricultural wastes and their modified. Moreover, the adsorption capacity for organic pollutants (such as dyes, petroleum hydrocarbons, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other organics) and desorption approaches have been investigated. In addition, optimization of activated carbon preparation conditions and adsorption process variables using response surface methodology (RSM) was also summarized. Adsorption mechanisms of organic pollutants are briefly discussed. The review implied the potential of agricultural wastes for organic pollutants removal from wastewater.
