You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Detailed analysis of olefins and diolefins in hydrotreated plastic waste pyrolysis oils by GC-VUV Recently, the hydrotreatment of plastic waste pyrolysis oils has been considered a promising route to remove heteroatoms and unsaturates from plastic pyrolysis oils to be used as steam cracking feedstock. As plastic waste pyrolysis oils differ vastly in composition from conventional crude oils, accurately identifying the different molecular species present in the mixture is essential to acquire further insights into their hydrogenation pathways. This work used gas chromatography coupled to a vacuum ultraviolet detector (GC-VUV) to obtain accurate quantification of (di)olefins compared to more conventional methods. It was found that there is no difference in intrinsic hydrogenation rates between diolefins and olefins, at least for chain lengths above C10. Moreover, an explicit dependency of the carbon chain length is identified on the hydrogenation rate for both olefins and diolefins with optimal hydrogenation rates up to C15. This is a consequence of the competition between hydrogenation and cracking reactions. Shorter unsaturated chains are thus formed because intrapore diffusional limitations prevent the hydrogenation of larger species. In addition, the degree of substitution (non-branched, methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, etc.) of the unsaturated molecules mattered concerning the hydrogenation rate. Linear olefins were more rapidly hydrogenated than branched components. Apart from hydrogenation, skeletal isomerization reactions are also important, especially at high olefin conversions. These fundamental insights demonstrate the capability of GC-VUV to analyze hydrotreated plastic pyrolysis oils and provide essential knowledge for designing and optimizing the hydrotreatment processes of plastic waste pyrolysis oils.
