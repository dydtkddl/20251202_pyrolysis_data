You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Column reactors in fluidized bed configuration as intensification system for xylitol and ethanol production from napier grass (Pennisetum Purpureum) Currently, the modern concept biorefinery industries require a consolidated, robust and cost-effective bioprocess applied to multi-products manufacturing. In alignment, this work presents biomass pretreatment of Pennisetum purpureum grass and integrated developments for carbohydrates portions utilization as carbon source for xylitol and ethanol production in intensified process conducted in column reactor with fluidized bed configuration, homogenized simply by air insertion. Primarily, by using hemicellulosic portion from acid hydrolysis, xylitol production was evaluated in column fluidized bed reactor by using the novel-wild Brazilian yeast Candida Tropicalis UFMGBX12-a verifying YP/S and Qp of 0.26 g/g and 0.06 g/L.h, respectively. Forwardly, the remaining celulignin from the acid hydrolysis was subjected to alkaline pretreatment, followed by Semi-Simultaneous saccharification and Fermentation process, in an intensification approach performed in column fluidized bed reactor, applied to ethanol production by Scheffersomyces Shehatae UFMG-HM 52.2. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass comprised 90% of glucose yield in 72h of saccharification, while ethanol productivity of 0.21 g/L.h, was found in 24 h of fermentation process. These new developments conferred potential use of Pennisetum purpureum grass as carbon source for xylitol and ethanol production in column reactor towards sustainable intensification process implementation.
