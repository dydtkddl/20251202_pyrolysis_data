You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress of metal organic frameworks and their derivatives for adsorption of anions in water: A review Anion pollution in water has become a problem that cannot be ignored. The anion concentration should be controlled below the national emission standard to meet the demand for clean water. Among the methods for removing excess anions in water, the adsorption method has a unique removal performance, and the core of the adsorption method is the adsorbent. In recent years, the emerging metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of adjustable porosity, high specific surface area, diverse functions, and easy modification. They are very competitive in the field of adsorption of liquid anions. This article focuses on the adsorption of fluoride, arsenate, chromate, radioactive anions (ReO4 −, TcO4 −, SeO4 2−/SeO3 2−), phosphate ion, chloride ion, and other anions by MOFs and their derivatives. The preparation methods of MOFs are introduced in turn, the application of different types of metal-based MOFs to adsorb various anions were discussed in categories with their crystal structure and functional groups. The influence on the adsorption of anions is analyzed, including the more common and special adsorption mechanisms, adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics, and regeneration performance are briefly described. Finally, the current situation of MOFs adsorption of anions is summarized, and the outlook for future development is summarized to provide my own opinions for the practical application of MOFs.
