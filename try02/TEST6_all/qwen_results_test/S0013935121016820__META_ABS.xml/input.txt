Research progress of metal organic frameworks and their derivatives for adsorption of anions in water: A review Anion pollution in water has become a problem that cannot be ignored. The anion concentration should be controlled below the national emission standard to meet the demand for clean water. Among the methods for removing excess anions in water, the adsorption method has a unique removal performance, and the core of the adsorption method is the adsorbent. In recent years, the emerging metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of adjustable porosity, high specific surface area, diverse functions, and easy modification. They are very competitive in the field of adsorption of liquid anions. This article focuses on the adsorption of fluoride, arsenate, chromate, radioactive anions (ReO4 −, TcO4 −, SeO4 2−/SeO3 2−), phosphate ion, chloride ion, and other anions by MOFs and their derivatives. The preparation methods of MOFs are introduced in turn, the application of different types of metal-based MOFs to adsorb various anions were discussed in categories with their crystal structure and functional groups. The influence on the adsorption of anions is analyzed, including the more common and special adsorption mechanisms, adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics, and regeneration performance are briefly described. Finally, the current situation of MOFs adsorption of anions is summarized, and the outlook for future development is summarized to provide my own opinions for the practical application of MOFs.
