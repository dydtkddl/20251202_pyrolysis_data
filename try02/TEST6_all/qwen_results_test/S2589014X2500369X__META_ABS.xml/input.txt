Simulation and economic evaluation of pyrolysis of Moroccan date stones and Argan nut shells using Aspen Plus The growing global demand for energy, coupled with increasing environmental concerns, underscores the urgent need for sustainable energy technologies. Effective biomass management plays a pivotal role in addressing this challenge, and pyrolysis has emerged as a promising alternative for converting agricultural residues into valuable energy products. This study investigates the potential of abundant agricultural by-products in Morocco, specifically Date stones and Argan nut shells, as feedstocks for pyrolysis. Using Aspen Plus® software, the study aims to optimize the pyrolysis conditions for these materials to maximize the yield of co-products. A thermodynamic equilibrium model was employed to analyze the distribution of pyrolysis products across a temperature range of 300–600 °C and a pressure range of 2–10 bar. Sensitivity analysis and techno-economic evaluation were conducted to assess both the feasibility and scalability of the process. The results show that the optimal pyrolysis temperature for maximizing bio-oil yield is 300 °C, achieving 34.38 % for Argan nut shells and 41.39 % for Date stones, while the optimal temperature for biochar production is 450 °C, with yields of 26.1 % and 22.07 %, respectively. The techno-economic analysis revealed a positive net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR), confirming the profitability and low-risk investment potential of the proposed pyrolysis process.
