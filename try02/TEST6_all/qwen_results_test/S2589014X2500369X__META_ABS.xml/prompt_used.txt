You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation and economic evaluation of pyrolysis of Moroccan date stones and Argan nut shells using Aspen Plus The growing global demand for energy, coupled with increasing environmental concerns, underscores the urgent need for sustainable energy technologies. Effective biomass management plays a pivotal role in addressing this challenge, and pyrolysis has emerged as a promising alternative for converting agricultural residues into valuable energy products. This study investigates the potential of abundant agricultural by-products in Morocco, specifically Date stones and Argan nut shells, as feedstocks for pyrolysis. Using Aspen Plus® software, the study aims to optimize the pyrolysis conditions for these materials to maximize the yield of co-products. A thermodynamic equilibrium model was employed to analyze the distribution of pyrolysis products across a temperature range of 300–600 °C and a pressure range of 2–10 bar. Sensitivity analysis and techno-economic evaluation were conducted to assess both the feasibility and scalability of the process. The results show that the optimal pyrolysis temperature for maximizing bio-oil yield is 300 °C, achieving 34.38 % for Argan nut shells and 41.39 % for Date stones, while the optimal temperature for biochar production is 450 °C, with yields of 26.1 % and 22.07 %, respectively. The techno-economic analysis revealed a positive net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR), confirming the profitability and low-risk investment potential of the proposed pyrolysis process.
