You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of Cu, Pb and Zn from stormwater using an industrially manufactured sawdust and paddy husk derived biochar Direct flow of untreated stormwater containing Cu, Pb and Zn is of immediate concern to aquatic life in waterways. To date, most biochar used has been synthesized under controlled laboratory conditions using furnaces purged with inert gasses. In this study, the removal of Cu, Pb and Zn using biochar synthesized using paddy husk and sawdust feedstocks has used an industrial scale double chamber downdraft pyrolysis reactor. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and the effect of feedstock in the removal of Cu, Pb and Zn was evaluated by conducting batch adsorption experiments. Synthesized adsorbent materials were characterized using proximate analysis, zero-point charge, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. The biochar yield was in a lower range compared with the literature attributed to the higher heating rate (50 °C/min) in the pyrolizer. Maximum removal efficiencies were observed when the initial pH was at the value closest, when below the solubility limit for the heavy metals. The paddy husk biochar and sawdust biochar synthesized in the temperature range 350–450 °C and 450–550 °C performed best in the removal of the three heavy metals. Chemisorption was the main mechanism for the removal of the three heavy metals. The maximum adsorption capacities of Cu and Zn were 10.27 and 6.48 mg/g was achieved with paddy husk biochar and a maximum Pb adsorption capacity of 17.57 mg/g was achieved by sawdust biochar. Surface complexation, co-precipitation, p-electron interactions, physical adsorption and surface precipitation were the main mechanisms of removal of the three heavy metals.
