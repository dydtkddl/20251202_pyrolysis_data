Analysis and simulation of mini pyrolysis reactor for conversion of plastic waste into fuel Plastic is one of the widely used materials in day to day activity in our life and involves a contribution to society. Plastic is a non-gradable material, remains in the soil and polluting the environment. Plastic pyrolysis is a novel technique to convert waste plastic into fuel. This work aims to analyze and simulate a mini reactor for the plastic pyrolysis process. The mini reactor is designed by 3D CAD and analyzed by ANSYS software. This mini reactor is designed to pyrolyze low-Density Poly Ethylene (LDPE) to withstand 650 °C. This work demonstrated the potential of finite element analysis of pyrolysis setup to determine thermal stress and strains. Maximum and minimum thermal stress and strain values developed inside the mini reactor for converting plastic waste into fuel were 127 MPa, 158 MPa, 0.001329, and 0.001649, respectively.
