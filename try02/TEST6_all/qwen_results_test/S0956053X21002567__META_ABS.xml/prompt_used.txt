You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing hydrocarbon production via ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and high-density polyethylene: Study of synergistic effect and aromatics selectivity We conducted ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of corn stalk (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over HZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the production of hydrocarbons. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and CS-to-HDPE mass ratio (CS/HDPE) on the yield of condensable volatile organic products (CVOPs) and the relative content of hydrocarbons were studied. The synergisms between CS and HDPE were determined based on the difference between the experimental and theoretical CVOP and hydrocarbons content. The results showed that the addition of HDPE significantly promotes the production of CVOPs, reaching the maximum value at 750 °C. In the presence of HZSM-5, the CVOP and hydrocarbons production, especially aromatics, were enhanced further, and 650 °C and 700 °C were the preferable pyrolysis temperature for desired products. Benzene, toluene, and xylenes were the predominant aromatics during the CFP process due to the good shape-selectivity of HZSM-5, contributing to the highest selectivity of C5–C11 compounds in C5+ hydrocarbons. CS/HDPE mass ratio of 1:1 was a critical point for enhancing aromatics yield. CS/HDPE < 1 was the recommended mass ratio for increasing the relative aromatic hydrocarbons content, which increases as the CS/HDPE mass ratio decreases. Meanwhile, we presented the potential reaction pathways between CS and HDPE to explain the synergistic effects during the co-CFP process.
