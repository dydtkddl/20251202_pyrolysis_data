You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The catalytic effect of inherent and adsorbed metals on the fast/flash pyrolysis of biomass: A review Relevant literature which deals with the presence of metals during the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass is reviewed. Only those conditions where the metal was in intimate contact with the biomass components are included. Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin all fuse during the early stages of pyrolytic heating and the dehydration and decomposition processes begin during this transition. Hemicelluloses such as xylan are more labile and difficult to isolate, whereas both cellulose and lignin produce mostly bio-oils when demineralised and flash pyrolysed. The dominant primary products from ‘pure’ cellulose are anhydrosugars as well as smaller oxygenates. Lignin gives aromatics based on the syringol and guiacol molecules. The alkali and alkaline earth metals are found to curtail the yield of bio-oil and modify product distribution, even in the low concentrations naturally found in biomass. All other metals act to catalyse cross-linking reactions, with the nickel and zinc most studied. The electropositivity of the metal tends to correlate with the extent of catalytic activity. The presence of metals causes little change to the production of gases, but more char is formed at the expense of liquids. If the aim of pyrolysis is bio-oil for fuel, prewashing of biomass to remove metals is beneficial.
