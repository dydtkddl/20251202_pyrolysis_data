You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced synergies for product distributions and interactions during co-pyrolysis between corn stover and tyres Co-pyrolysis has been studied for its potential to recycle energy from biomass and waste tyres, as well as enhance the quality of the bio-oil. In this paper, the TG-FTIR-GC/MS technique and a fast-infrared heated reactor were used to investigate the co-pyrolysis behaviors and mechanism of waste tyres (WT) and corn stover (CS). Based on the TG-FTIR-GC/MS analysis, co-pyrolysis synergy promoted the production of methane and aromatics while inhibiting the formation of CO2. Co-pyrolysis products distribution shows that the best synergy occurred at a ratio of 30 % WT with the highest oil yield deviation of 19.67 % and the lowest water yield deviation of −13.30 %. Response surface method (RSM) was utilized to optimize the oil production and the highest oil yield of 30.25 wt% was acquired at a heating rate of 25 °C/s and a ratio of 40 % WT. According to the oil analysis, the light fraction of oil (gasoline and diesel) was more than 50 % in all conditions and there was a large number of aromatics (more than 30 %) presented in oil. The char characteristics indicated that several metals combined with -S radicals during co-pyrolysis which formed much metal sulfide and sulfate in chars.
