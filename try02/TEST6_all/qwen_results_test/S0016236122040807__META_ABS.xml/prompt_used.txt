You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of biomass ash on preventing aromatization of olefinic cracking products in dual fluidized bed systems In this work, the effect of ash activated olivine on olefinic products cracking and aromatization was assessed. The experiments were carried out in the Chalmers 2–4 MWth dual fluidized bed gasifier, where the feedstock was cracked using steam as fluidization agent, at a reaction temperature of ca. 780–790 °C. Three activation states of the olivine, representing three consecutive days of the campaign, were evaluated. The changes of the permanent gas composition along with the reduction in aromatic species with the time of exposure to biomass ash demonstrate a clear effect of the ash activated olivine on the conversion of olefinic cracking products. The ash activation of the olivine clearly promoted the reactions involving steam. As a consequence, higher yields of permanent gases, mainly H2, CO and CO2, were produced at expenses of the yields of the total aromatic compounds and C4 hydrocarbons and larger. It is concluded that the biomass ash activated olivine promotes the steam reforming path of the C4 and larger hydrocarbon fragments, while avoiding the alternative aromatization route. The results presented here provide useful insights on the opportunities and limitations of ash activated materials in DFB systems when steam cracking linear hydrocarbon feedstocks, e.g., polyolefin-based materials.
