Enhancing lignite coal quality with biomass waste in slow pyrolysis Fischer-Tropsch reactor Coal is a non-renewable natural resource that is widely used in thermal power plants in major industrialized countries. Most of the world's coal contains a high percentage of moisture and ash and a low caloric value. The slow pyrolysis process of coal improves its quality and significantly reduces its smoke and ash. In this study, Soma Kisrakdere lignite coal in Manisa province in Turkey with some biomass wastes (peanut shells, pine cones, and olive seeds) was evaluated by applying a slow pyrolysis process using a Fischer-Tropisch reactor. Firstly, Soma Kisrakdere lignite alone, then each waste biomass was mixed with lignite coal at weight percentages of 10 %, 25 %, and 50 % to form three mixtures for each biomass waste. The process temperature was 500°C, and the temperature rate was 0.1 °C/s. The findings obtained in this study showed that with the increase of weight percentages of biomass which added from biomass waste to lignite coal, the productivity of coal (biochar) decreased and the products of tar, decomposed water, and gases increased. As for calories, its value increased with the increase in weight of the addition the waste of biomass which added where 50 % of biomass additions were the highest value of low heating value (LHV) and high heating value (HHV) and most effective than others which added to lignite coal. Among the biomass residues used, the olive seeds were the most valuable, compared with the peanut shells and pine cones.
