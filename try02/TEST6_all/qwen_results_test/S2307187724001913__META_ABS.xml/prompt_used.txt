You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing lignite coal quality with biomass waste in slow pyrolysis Fischer-Tropsch reactor Coal is a non-renewable natural resource that is widely used in thermal power plants in major industrialized countries. Most of the world's coal contains a high percentage of moisture and ash and a low caloric value. The slow pyrolysis process of coal improves its quality and significantly reduces its smoke and ash. In this study, Soma Kisrakdere lignite coal in Manisa province in Turkey with some biomass wastes (peanut shells, pine cones, and olive seeds) was evaluated by applying a slow pyrolysis process using a Fischer-Tropisch reactor. Firstly, Soma Kisrakdere lignite alone, then each waste biomass was mixed with lignite coal at weight percentages of 10 %, 25 %, and 50 % to form three mixtures for each biomass waste. The process temperature was 500°C, and the temperature rate was 0.1 °C/s. The findings obtained in this study showed that with the increase of weight percentages of biomass which added from biomass waste to lignite coal, the productivity of coal (biochar) decreased and the products of tar, decomposed water, and gases increased. As for calories, its value increased with the increase in weight of the addition the waste of biomass which added where 50 % of biomass additions were the highest value of low heating value (LHV) and high heating value (HHV) and most effective than others which added to lignite coal. Among the biomass residues used, the olive seeds were the most valuable, compared with the peanut shells and pine cones.
