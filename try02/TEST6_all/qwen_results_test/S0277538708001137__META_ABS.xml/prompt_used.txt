You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal fragmentation of the guanidinato aluminum amide precursor [Me2NC(N i Pr)2]Al(NMe2)2: An investigation of reactive species by matrix-isolation FTIR spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry The gas-phase thermolysis of the guanidinato aluminum amide precursor [Me2NC(N i Pr)2]Al(NMe2)2 (1) in the oven temperature range of ambient temperatures to 600°C has been investigated with matrix-isolation FTIR spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (argon as carrier gas). Precursor 1 fragments above 300°C to form iPrCNCiPr (2) and monomeric Al(NMe2)3 (3m). Independent thermolysis series with 2 and the aluminum amide dimer 3d, [Al(NMe2)3]2, were conducted and been used to interpret the results of the fragmentation of precursor 1. Compound 3m was present in the thermolysis range of 350–450°C and has been identified for the first time. Through a comparison of measured FTIR spectra with the calculated spectrum of 3m (D 3 point group symmetry; B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) all expected IR bands were found and could be assigned to normal modes. At thermolysis temperatures of ⩾500°C signals indicative for H2CNCH3 (4) were found, showing that 3m fragments further at higher temperature. The thermolysis product 2 (iPrCNCiPr) withstands the higher thermolysis temperatures. From our study one can conclude that precursor 1 cleanly delivers the monomeric aluminum alane 3m, which then acts as the reactive material forming species.
