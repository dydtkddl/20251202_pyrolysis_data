You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Generating alternative fuel and bioplastics from medical plastic waste and waste frying oil using microwave co-pyrolysis combined with microbial fermentation In the present study, microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) was used to simultaneously convert medical plastic waste (MPW) and waste frying oil (WFO) into liquid oil products. The MCP process demonstrated a faster heating rate (24 °C/min) and shorter process time (20 min) compared to conventional pyrolysis techniques converting MPW and WFO into liquid oil (≥80 wt%). The MCP reduced the oxygen content from 25.7 to 9.82 wt% in liquid oil encompassing light aliphatic hydrocarbons ranging from C10 to C28, generating a novel sustainable liquid fuel. The liquid having a high carbon content (approximately 77.1 wt%) and low carbon to nitrogen ratio (27.9) is a suitable energy feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) bioplastic production in the form of poly3-hydroxybutyrate [P(3HB)]. The liquid oil acted as an energy source for the growth of Bacillus sp. During microbial fermentation, yielding approximately 11% (w/w) P(3HB). Bioplastics are biodegradable, biocompatible with humans and non-toxic to marine organisms, representing a valuable additive in the production of cosmetics, detergents, and as medical scaffolds for tissue engineering. The results indicate the promising upcycling of waste products by this approach through pyrolytic biorefinery into value-added fuel and bioplastic products, being important for the future sustainable production of renewable resources.
