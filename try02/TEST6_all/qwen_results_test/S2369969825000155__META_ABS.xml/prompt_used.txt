You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge for circular bioeconomy: Focus on lignocellulose wastes, microplastics, and pharmaceuticals The rapid increase in sewage sludge (SS) generation from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has become a pressing global environmental challenge. The SS contains a wide variety of pollutants, including lignocellulose from plants and paper wastes, microplastics (MPs) from plastic wastes, and pharmaceutical residues (PRs), all of which pose substantial risks to ecosystems and human health. To address these waste management issues while also meeting rising energy demands, a shift towards a circular bioeconomy is essential. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of SS (SS-HTL) presents a sustainable solution by converting waste into renewable biofuels and mitigating environmental hazards. This review addresses five key areas: (1) an in-depth analysis of current advancements in SS-HTL technology; (2) factors influencing bio-oil production; (3) transformation pathways of lignocellulose, MPs, and PRs during HTL; (4) advanced methods for upgrading SS, including chemical, mechanical, and in situ liquefaction techniques; and (5) future perspectives on enhancing SS-HTL technology. Additionally, the review evaluates the potential applications of byproducts like the aqueous (AQ) phase, solid residues (SRs), and gases. By addressing the challenges in SS-HTL research and implementation, this article aims to improve economic feasibility and expand industrial applications. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and innovators committed to advancing waste management technologies and accelerating the transition to a sustainable circular bioeconomy.
