You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides over reduced mesostructured Ni/γ-alumina catalysts prepared via one-pot sol-gel route for green diesel production Environmentally friendly non-sulfided mesostructured Ni/γ-alumina catalysts were synthesized and developed to produce green diesel from canola oil. The catalysts were prepared either by a one-pot sol-gel (SG) via evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) or by incipient wetness impregnation (IMP). They were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, NH3-TPD and TEM. Due to the incorporation of nickel in the mesostructured framework, bulk nickel oxide species are lower for SG catalysts compared to IMP ones. Formation of active metallic nickel was confirmed after in-situ pre-reduction in H2 for both SG and IMP catalysts. Continuous hydrotreatment of canola oil was performed in a down-flow fixed-bed reactor, and the liquid hydrocarbon products mainly contained C15-C18 n-alkanes. SG catalyst exhibited a better stability up to 10 h of time on stream (TOS). The IMP catalyst initially showed higher conversion than SG up to TOS:300 min; it thereafter decreased sharply to values lower than those of SG.
