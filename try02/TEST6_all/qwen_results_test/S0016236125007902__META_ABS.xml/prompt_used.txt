You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in non-renewable and hybrid hydrogen production: Technological innovations for efficiency and carbon reduction Hydrogen is recognized as a versatile and clean energy carrier that plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy. This comprehensive review examines recent advancements in non-renewable and hybrid hydrogen production technologies, with a particular emphasis on their potential to reduce carbon emissions while simultaneously promoting efficiency and scalability. Conventional approaches to hydrogen production, including steam methane reforming, dry reforming, partial oxidation, and gasification, have undergone substantial advancements due to innovations in catalytic processes, reactor configurations, and the incorporation of carbon capture technologies. Emerging hybrid methodologies that integrate fossil fuels with renewable energy sources present a promising strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously utilizing the existing energy infrastructure. Moreover, advanced methodologies, including plasma-assisted reforming, chemical looping processes, and nuclear-based hydrogen production, are significantly reshaping the domain of clean hydrogen generation by effectively addressing critical technical and environmental challenges. This review further investigates the economic, environmental, and operational implications associated with these methodologies, offering a comprehensive assessment of their feasibility and impact. Future research directions emphasize the necessity of developing cost-effective materials, enhancing reactor efficiency, and incorporating artificial intelligence for the optimization of processes. This review underscores the transformative potential of non-renewable hydrogen production in the establishment of a global hydrogen economy by integrating technological advancements with sustainable practices.
