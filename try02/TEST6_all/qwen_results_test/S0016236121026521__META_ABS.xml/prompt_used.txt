You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the physicochemical structure and gasification reactivity of chars from pyrolysis of biomass pellets under different heating rates The physicochemical properties of chars produced from biomass pellet pyrolysis under different heating rates were characterized including basic fuel properties, physical properties, chemical structure, and gasification reactivity. Results showed that after pyrolysis, the volume density and compressive strength of pellet were significantly decreased, especially for the isothermal pyrolysis. The char yield was decreased from 26.09 to 23.54 wt% with the heating rate raising from 2 to 25 K/min, and it would further slightly decrease by about 3 wt% after holding for 1 h. The chemical structure analysis of chars explained that with the increase of heating rate, the crystal stacking height and surface area were decreased, probably due to the limited volatile-char interaction within pellets and the destroyed pore structure by violently released volatiles at higher heating rate. On the other hand, the increased heating rate led to the drastic cracking and diffusion of volatiles which resulted in the increase of surface area to 327.17 m2/g at 25 K/min. The inverse factors explained that the effects of heating rate on crystal interlayer spacing, microcrystalline size, aromatic structure, pore volume and gasification reactivity were not regular. After holding process, the chars were further carbonized and condensed, which resulted in the increased fused ring structure and the reduction of about 0.004–0.010 min−1 for gasification reactivity index. This study provided the basic knowledge on the physicochemical structure of char produced from biomass pellet and further understanding of its gasification reactivity.
