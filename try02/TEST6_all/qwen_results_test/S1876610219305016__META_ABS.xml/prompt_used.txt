You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transesterification of waste cooking oil: Quality assessment via thermogravimetric analysis Biodiesel is a good substitute for petrol-diesel at lower greenhouse emissions footprint. Biodiesel is commonly generated through transesterification of lipid, animal fat and waste cooking oil (WCO) with alcohol in the presence of catalyst. Assessment of the product quality of biodiesel and the byproduct for further utilization can be done using Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) instead of more involved and specialized technique such as GC/MS and HLPC. TGA of biodiesel and the crude byproduct glycerol were investigated in this work following transesterification essay under different reactants ratio and catalysis concentrations. Biodiesel TA thermographs was characterized by four events and with two distinct peaks shown in the derivative of TGA curve. The crude glycerol showed three pronounced peaks. The best conversion of WCO to biodiesel was determined based on the fraction of biodiesel or the 2nd TGA event. Highest conversion was obtained at 12:1 Methanol:WCO molar ratio 93% compared to 65%, 77% and 89% at 3:1, 6:1, 9:1 ratio, respectively. The influence of the catalyst is observed at lower molar ratio by advancing the conversion from 65% to 77% and 79% to 93% at 3:1 and 6:1 Methanol:WCO ratio, respectively. Higher glycerol quality was obtained at lower catalyst concentration.
