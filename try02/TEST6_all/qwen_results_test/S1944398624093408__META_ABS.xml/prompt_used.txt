You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic thermal treatment (thermolysis) process of tannery wastewater for the removal of chemical oxygen demand and color The aim of present research work is to treat the tannery wastewater (TWW) using catalytic ther­ mal treatment process. The treatment of TWW was done on the basis of removal of COD and color in a batch system. All the experiments have been carried out in a batch system. Effect of various process parameters such as pH (2–9), thermolysis time (0–6 h), temperature (55°C–95°C), catalyst loading (Cw) (1–6 g/L), and two types of catalysts (copper sulfate and copper oxide) was studied on the removal efficiency of COD and color from wastewater. Copper sulfate was found to be a better catalyst as compared with copper oxide during thermolysis for TWW. The observed results exhibited that maximum COD removal of 71.36% and color removal of 77.56% were achieved using copper sulfate at the optimized conditions of pH of 4, catalyst loading of 4 g/L, temperature of 95°C, and thermolysis time of 6 h. Kinetic study followed the first order kinetics model and it was observed that the COD reduction was found to be two steps (fast and slow steps) mechanisms. The observed higher values of rate constant (k1) showed that rate of reaction was fast in the first step of thermolysis. Initial pH played an important role in COD removal. The settling rate of the slurry was good and strongly affected by pH values. It has been observed that treated wastewa­ ter provided the best (fastest) filterability at the pH 12. The energy consumption was found to be 2,619 kWh/kg of COD removal under the optimized process conditions. Overall, it can be said that thermolysis process can be employed for the treatment of industrial wastewater.
