You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A pseudo-local heat transfer approach in a low tube to particle diameter ratio packed bed catalytic reactor: Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane as a case study A generalized approach to model heat transfer in an industrial-scale wall-cooled packed bed reactor with a low tube-to-particle diameter ratio (<8) is proposed and assessed in this work. The modeling approach rests on the realization of experiments carried out in absence of reaction in bench-scale as well as in industrial-scale packed beds. The approximation overcomes historical limitations identified when modeling radial heat transfer mechanisms by applying conventional approaches. The methodology leads to the reliable determination of the external wall heat transfer coefficient and pseudo-local radial effective thermal conductivity. The approach allows the quantification of heat transfer resistances through the core, the internal and the external wall of the bed indicating that approximately 30 % of the resistances are located along the internal side of the packed bed when it was operated at Particle Reynolds numbers ranging from 700 to 1400. Because of its complex impact on heat transfer, fluid dynamics is accounted for by implementing a methodology that uses pressure drop data and the mass conservation criterion to describe velocity profiles, including the determination of the viscous and inertial resistances caused by solid surfaces at the core and near the wall. Finally, the heat transfer information is transferred to a pseudo-heterogenous model to simulate the performance of an industrial-scale wall-cooled packed bed reactor for the highly exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Simulations demonstrate both the reliability of the proposed heat transfer approach and the limitations of the conventional approximations when describing temperature profiles in a packed bed reactor.
