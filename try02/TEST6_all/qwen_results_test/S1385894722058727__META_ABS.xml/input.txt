A pseudo-local heat transfer approach in a low tube to particle diameter ratio packed bed catalytic reactor: Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane as a case study A generalized approach to model heat transfer in an industrial-scale wall-cooled packed bed reactor with a low tube-to-particle diameter ratio (<8) is proposed and assessed in this work. The modeling approach rests on the realization of experiments carried out in absence of reaction in bench-scale as well as in industrial-scale packed beds. The approximation overcomes historical limitations identified when modeling radial heat transfer mechanisms by applying conventional approaches. The methodology leads to the reliable determination of the external wall heat transfer coefficient and pseudo-local radial effective thermal conductivity. The approach allows the quantification of heat transfer resistances through the core, the internal and the external wall of the bed indicating that approximately 30 % of the resistances are located along the internal side of the packed bed when it was operated at Particle Reynolds numbers ranging from 700 to 1400. Because of its complex impact on heat transfer, fluid dynamics is accounted for by implementing a methodology that uses pressure drop data and the mass conservation criterion to describe velocity profiles, including the determination of the viscous and inertial resistances caused by solid surfaces at the core and near the wall. Finally, the heat transfer information is transferred to a pseudo-heterogenous model to simulate the performance of an industrial-scale wall-cooled packed bed reactor for the highly exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Simulations demonstrate both the reliability of the proposed heat transfer approach and the limitations of the conventional approximations when describing temperature profiles in a packed bed reactor.
