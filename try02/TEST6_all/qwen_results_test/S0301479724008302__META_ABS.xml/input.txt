Fuel properties and incineration behavior of poultry litter blended with sweet sorghum bagasse and pyrolysis oil The incineration of poultry litter (PL) effectively reduces the volume of waste in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of “affordable and clean energy”. However, mono-incineration is associated with considerable challenges due to the varying moisture, structural and chemical composition and low energy yield. The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of sweet sorghum bagasse (SS) and pyrolysis oil (PO) on improving the fuel properties of PL and mitigating ash related burdens during incineration. The different biomass feedstocks were produced by combining PL with SS at 0.0% (T0), 25% (T1), 50% (T2), 75% (T3) and compared with 100% SS (T4). In order to achieve high energy potential and low ash deposition, the parallel samples were additionally mixed with 10% PO to improve the energy value. The experimental results show that increasing the proportion of SS and adding PO to the mixtures increases the volatile matter and decreases the moisture and ash content. The addition of PO also increases the carbon and hydrogen content. The use of SS and PO thus increased the values of the ignitability index and apparently also the flammability by 30.0%–49.4% compared to pure PL. SS and PO shifted the HHV of the starting material from 16.90 to 18.78 MJ kg−1. In addition, SS + PO improved the flame volume and red color intensity of the PL blends based on the image analysis method. However, the presence of SS and PO did not sufficiently improve the ash-related index values, which requires further investigation.
