You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fuel properties and incineration behavior of poultry litter blended with sweet sorghum bagasse and pyrolysis oil The incineration of poultry litter (PL) effectively reduces the volume of waste in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of “affordable and clean energy”. However, mono-incineration is associated with considerable challenges due to the varying moisture, structural and chemical composition and low energy yield. The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of sweet sorghum bagasse (SS) and pyrolysis oil (PO) on improving the fuel properties of PL and mitigating ash related burdens during incineration. The different biomass feedstocks were produced by combining PL with SS at 0.0% (T0), 25% (T1), 50% (T2), 75% (T3) and compared with 100% SS (T4). In order to achieve high energy potential and low ash deposition, the parallel samples were additionally mixed with 10% PO to improve the energy value. The experimental results show that increasing the proportion of SS and adding PO to the mixtures increases the volatile matter and decreases the moisture and ash content. The addition of PO also increases the carbon and hydrogen content. The use of SS and PO thus increased the values of the ignitability index and apparently also the flammability by 30.0%–49.4% compared to pure PL. SS and PO shifted the HHV of the starting material from 16.90 to 18.78 MJ kg−1. In addition, SS + PO improved the flame volume and red color intensity of the PL blends based on the image analysis method. However, the presence of SS and PO did not sufficiently improve the ash-related index values, which requires further investigation.
