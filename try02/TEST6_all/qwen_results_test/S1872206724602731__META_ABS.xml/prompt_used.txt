You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zeolites in the epoch of catalytic recycling plastic waste: Toward circular economy and sustainability Current ever-accumulating plastic waste can be considered a significant carbon resource for energy conversion and chemical production. The development of new approaches for upcycling plastic waste through chemical degradation may enable circularity and promote closed-loop recycling of carbon sources compared to traditional recycling methods. Zeolite, a widely used solid acid catalyst with high industrial potential in petroleum and biomass refining, has been extensively studied for its role in transforming plastics. In this review, we present an overview of zeolite-based catalytic systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste and discuss how zeolites could potentially contribute to the future development of a circular economy. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we begin with a brief introduction to zeolites, analyzing their key features and exploring their opportunities as well as challenges in processing plastic waste. Subsequently, we delve into the chemistry of catalytic cracking and tandem catalysis using zeolite-based catalysts on plastics. Overall, we emphasize the importance of intelligent catalyst design and lower-energy pathways to incentivize plastic upcycling while alleviating the burden caused by waste plastics.
