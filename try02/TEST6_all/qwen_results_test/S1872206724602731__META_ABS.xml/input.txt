Zeolites in the epoch of catalytic recycling plastic waste: Toward circular economy and sustainability Current ever-accumulating plastic waste can be considered a significant carbon resource for energy conversion and chemical production. The development of new approaches for upcycling plastic waste through chemical degradation may enable circularity and promote closed-loop recycling of carbon sources compared to traditional recycling methods. Zeolite, a widely used solid acid catalyst with high industrial potential in petroleum and biomass refining, has been extensively studied for its role in transforming plastics. In this review, we present an overview of zeolite-based catalytic systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste and discuss how zeolites could potentially contribute to the future development of a circular economy. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we begin with a brief introduction to zeolites, analyzing their key features and exploring their opportunities as well as challenges in processing plastic waste. Subsequently, we delve into the chemistry of catalytic cracking and tandem catalysis using zeolite-based catalysts on plastics. Overall, we emphasize the importance of intelligent catalyst design and lower-energy pathways to incentivize plastic upcycling while alleviating the burden caused by waste plastics.
