You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fate and behavior of inorganic constituents of RDF in a two stage fluid bed-plasma gasification plant To accelerate progress in the industrial use of RDF as an alternative fuel in gasification plants, the problems associated with hazardous solid residues and ash deposition must be resolved. The practical approach to reduce these problems must be aimed at preventing the accumulation of fly ash/condensable vapours on heat transfer surface areas while minimising the amount of residual materials that have to be treated before the disposal. One such approach is adopted in an advanced two-stage thermal process which incorporates a plasma processing stage for conditioning the gas generated from a primary waste gasification unit, primarily for the treatment of household and industrial wastes. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of ashes sampled under different operational conditions and in different locations of a two-stage fluid bed-plasma demonstration plant. A demonstration test miming the normal commercial operation was conducted over 44h of operation with RDF from a standard UK municipal solid waste. The results are presented according to solid samples composition, gas composition, and further specific data (e.g., enrichment factor, XRD analysis, leaching test, etc.). An investigation on pollutant removal from the hot syngas, focusing on the partitioning and chemistry of sulphur and chlorine along with other relevant components, is also carried out. Experimental trials revealed a reduced extent of alkali and metals availability in the gas phase, i.e. a minor deposit forming potential into downstream equipment. From 85% to 91% of the fly ash was captured and vitrified within the plasma converter and made non-leachable with respect to non-volatile heavy metals, allowing for near complete landfill diversion.
