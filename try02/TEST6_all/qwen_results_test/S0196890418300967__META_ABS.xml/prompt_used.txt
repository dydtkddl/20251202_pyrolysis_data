You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on catalytic co-pyrolysis of physical mixture/staged pyrolysis characteristics of lignite and straw over an catalytic beds of char and its mechanism Although the study of co-pyrolysis of coal and biomass have dominated the primary chemicals production in the field of renewable energy utilization, it is still challenging for tar to become lighter. Here we design a set of experimental programs, including the individual pyrolysis, staged catalytic pyrolysis and the co-pyrolysis of physical mixture to investigate the effects of feedstock arrangement on pyrolysis product characteristics. We demonstrated that the experimental results of co-pyrolysis of physical mixture indicate some synergetic effects on pyrolysis products rather than the superposition of individual pyrolysis process of lignite and straw, thus the subsequent tar composition and char structure were characterized. Based on the existing catalytic cracking mechanism, we obtained the staged catalytic pyrolysis have a more pronounced catalytic cracking effect on heavy components compared with the co-pyrolysis of physical mixture, which enables the formation of light oil, naphthalene oil, tar with the lower oxygen content and higher benzene. The Raman spectra of char in catalytic bed exhibits the total peak area of char and the amount of large aromatic ring formed by polymerization increased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. Simultaneously, the role of catalytic cracking of straw char was stronger than that of lignite char remarkably has been confirmed from the point of view of the chemical structure of char.
