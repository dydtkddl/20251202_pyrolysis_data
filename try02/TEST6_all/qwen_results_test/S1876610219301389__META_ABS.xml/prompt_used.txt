You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of calcium and magnesium catalyst on pyrolysis kinetic of Indonesian sugarcane bagasse for biofuel production The present study aims to investigate the effect of CaO and MgO as catalyst in pyrolysis of Indonesian sugarcane bagasse (SCB) for biofuel production. Prior to being used as raw material, SCB underwent acid washing to remove its inherent Ca and Mg content. Catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis experiment were performed in a fixed-bed reactor within a temperature range of 20-480oC. Thermogravimetric Analysis was used to describe the mechanism of pyrolysis and one-step global model was employed to determine the reaction kinetics. Pyrolysis stage comprised of a rapid decomposition zone (260-340oC) and slow decomposition zone (340-480oC). TG curve confirmed that the endothermic cellulose decomposition and volatilization was more dominant than exothermic polymerization and aromatization of lignin. Moreover, CaO provided the highest reaction kinetics with the lowest reaction order compared with catalytic pyrolysis with MgO and non-catalytic process, both in rapid and slow zone. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Differential Thermal Gravimetric (DTG) corresponded to this by showing that the energy for decomposition in non-catalytic process and using MgO and without catalyst was higher than SCB0-Ca which gave the highest conversion rate. Hence, this study shows that the addition of CaO as catalyst can improve the kinetics of SCB pyrolysis.
