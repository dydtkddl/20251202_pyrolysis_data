Valorization of municipal solid waste from Marocco towards hydrogen, methanol, or electricity: An experimental and process simulation study Worldwide population growth and improvements in living standards are leading to a significant increase in municipal solid waste production, particularly in developing countries. In these regions, a well-established waste management strategy is often lacking, and alternatives to illegal landfills must be explored. Pyrolysis is a technology that can be used for the valorization of MSW to produce high-value products. However, several aspects require further elucidation for industrial application. This study aims to assess the valorization of unsorted MSW from Morocco, focusing on the production of methanol, hydrogen, or electrical power. To this end, both pyrolysis of MSW and gasification of the residual char were experimentally investigated to generate raw syngas. Computer-aided process simulations were then conducted to evaluate the technical and environmental aspects of converting the resulting syngas mixtures into the desired products: methanol, pure hydrogen, or electricity.
