You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-response optimization of sewage sludge-derived hydrochar production and its CO2-assisted gasification performance The harmful effects of improper sewage sludge (SS) treatment on the environment inspire the search for more benign sludge processing techniques such as hydrothermal carbonization (HTC); the abundant organic matter in SS is used for energy recovery. Here, we aimed to optimize the HTC-based preparation of SS hydrochar and its gasification performance by using response surface methodology (RSM). Specifically, the hydrochar yield, higher heating value (HHV), and gasification activity index were selected as optimization goals, whereas carbonization temperature (160–260 °C), residence time (30–150 min), and acetic acid concentration (0–1.5 M) were selected as factors influencing the HTC process and CO2-assisted gasification performance. Carbonization temperature was the dominant parameter determining hydrochar yield, HHV, and gasification activity. The hydrochar yield (82.69%) and calorific value (7820.99 kJ kg−1) were maximized under comparatively mild conditions (160 °C, 30 min, and 0.07 M acetic acid), whereas the gasification activity index (0.288 s−1) was maximized under harsher conditions (211.34 °C, 88.16 min, and 1.58 M acetic acid). The results help to guide the HTC of SS intended for gasification, thus promoting the development of this promising waste-to-energy technology and may facilitate the design and further optimization of thermochemical SS conversion.
