Metal phthalocyanines fixed onto polyorganosiloxane matrices as oxidation catalysts for HS groups New samples were prepared by supporting sulpho-derivatives of cobalt phthalocyanine on the surface of poly(amino, methyl)siloxane matrices as well as by their insertion onto the matrix framework during synthesis. A comparison of the catalytic activity of the resulting samples in the oxidation of a sulphide solution was carried out. A study of the structure of encapsulated and fixed CoPc as well as their state after the catalytic reaction were carried out using reflectance electron spectroscopy.
