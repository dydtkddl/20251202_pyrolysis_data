Chemical mechanisms of hexachlorobutadiene reactions in the environment Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD) has received increasing attention because of its adverse effects on human health. Although HCBD is regulated under the Stockholm Convention, it is still widely detected in the environment. However, detailed reports on the chemical mechanisms of HCBD reactions in the environment are lacking. This review comprehensively summarizes HCBD's unintentional industrial sources and formation mechanisms, and chemical reactions and transformations in different media (gas, water, and biological phases). Photochemical reactions in the atmosphere can degrade and transform HCBD and potentially form other toxic compounds, such as phosgene. Aerobic pyrolysis of HCBD can generate complex byproducts. Further research is essential to fully understand the environmental behavior of HCBD.
