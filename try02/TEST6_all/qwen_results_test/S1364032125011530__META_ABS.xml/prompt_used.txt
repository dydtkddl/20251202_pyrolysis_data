You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic oil from biomass, plastics, and tires: Production, properties, and tailored upgrading strategies for sustainable application The growing demand for sustainable energy and the urgent need to reduce fossil fuel reliance have intensified interest in converting waste materials into valuable resources. Pyrolytic oil, derived from biomass, plastic waste, and end-of-life tires through thermochemical conversion, offers promising potential as a renewable liquid fuel. However, its direct use is limited by high oxygen content, viscosity, and poor stability, necessitating upgrading. This review provides a comprehensive overview of pyrolytic oil production, physicochemical characteristics, and current upgrading strategies. It examines the influence of feedstock type, pyrolysis technology, and process parameters on product yield and oil quality, with particular focus on three representative pyrolytic oils: bio-oil, plastic-derived pyrolytic oil (PPO), and tire-derived pyrolytic oil (TPO). The review further critically assesses a broad range of upgrading strategies, including catalytic cracking, hydrogenation, steam reforming, electrocatalysis, solvent addition, distillation, extraction, co-pyrolysis, emulsification, and supercritical fluids processing, with emphasis on their suitability for different oil types. Results indicate that bio-oil is best upgraded through hydrogenation, water-based extraction, or supercritical fluid processing. In contrast, PPO, benefits more from solvent addition, mild hydrogenation, or distillation, while TPO requires robust catalytic systems and advanced extraction or co-pyrolysis approaches for impurity removal and quality improvement. The review concludes by identifying key technical challenges such as catalyst deactivation and feedstock heterogeneity, and outlines future research directions focused on catalytic design, process integration, and system optimization. Overall, this review offers essential insights to guide the sustainable utilization of pyrolytic oils in energy and materials applications.
