You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A CFD model for biomass fast pyrolysis in fluidized-bed reactors In this work, an Euler–Euler multiphase CFD model is proposed for continuous fast pyrolysis of biomass in a fluidized-bed reactor. In the model, a lumped, multi-component, multi-stage kinetic model is applied to describe the pyrolysis of a biomass particle. Variable particle porosity is used to account for the evolution of the particle's physical properties. Biomass is modeled as a composite of three reference components: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Pyrolysis products are categorized into three groups: gas, tar vapor (bio-oil), and solid char. The particle kinetic processes and their interactions with the reactive gas phase are modeled with a multi-fluid description derived from the kinetic theory of granular flows. A time-splitting approach is applied to decouple the convection and reaction calculations using a synchronized time step. The CFD model is employed to study the fast pyrolysis of both cellulose and bagasse in a lab-scale fluidized-bed reactor. The dynamics, particle heating, reaction of the biomass phase, char formation, elutriation, and spatial distribution of tar and gas inside the reactor are investigated. The yields of tar, gas, and char are also discussed.
