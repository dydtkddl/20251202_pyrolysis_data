You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the reaction mechanism for supercritical H2O/CO2 gasification of coal Under the dual background that oxidation reaction is used as internal heat source for supercritical water gasification and CO2 utilization, the exploration of supercritical H2O/CO2 gasification reaction mechanism is conducive to the promotion of new gasification technology. Based on the active site mechanism and pore structure, the reaction mechanism of the supercritical H2O/CO2 gasification of coal at 550–650 °C is revealed. The results showed that CO2 and H2O were competition mechanism in the supercritical H2O/CO2 gasification process, in which the addition of CO2 would lead to the decrease of carbon gasification efficiency from 25.7 % to 20 %, but the appropriate amount of CO2 (initial CO2 coefficient N = 0.5) would increase the CH4 yield to 10.64 mol/kg. Therefore, the moderate amount of CO2 (N = 0.5) will promote the transfer of hydrogen element from the water phase to the gas phase, but the addition of excessive CO2 (N = 1) will lead to the transfer of hydrogen element from the gas phase to the water phase, oil phase and solid phase; the addition of CO2 will inhibit the aromatization process of coal, lead to the aggravation of the disorder degree of gasification residue, and CO2 is not conducive to pore development, which will reduce the pore surface roughness and enhance the homogeneity of pore structure. When the high-pressure pyrolysis temperature is 500 °C, the hydrogen yield of Char500 is higher and the maturity of organic matter in the gasification residue is higher.
