You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of plastic composition on the performance of the integrated process of pyrolysis and oxidative steam reforming for hydrogen production The pyrolysis and oxidative steam reforming (P-OSR) of different types of plastics (HDPE, PP, PET and PS) has been carried out in a two reactor system provided with a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR). The effect plastic composition has on the oxidative steam reforming step has been analyzed using two space time values (3.1 gcatalyst min gplastic −1 and 12.5 gcatalyst min gplastic −1) at a reforming temperature of 700 °C, S/P ratio of 3 and ER of 0.2 (optimum conditions for autothermal reforming). The different composition of the plastics leads to differences in the yields and compositions of pyrolysis products, and consequently in the performance of the oxidative steam reforming step. High conversions (> 97 %) have been achieved by using a space time of 12.5 gcat min gplastic −1, with H2 production increasing as follows: PET ≪ PS < HDPE ≤ PP. A maximum H2 production of 25.5 wt% has been obtained by using PP, which is lower than that obtained in the process of pyrolysis and in line conventional steam reforming (P-SR) of the same feedstock (34.8 wt%). The lowest H2 production (10.5 wt%) has been achieved when PET was used due to the high oxygen content of this plastic. The results obtained in this study prove that P-OSR performs very well with different feedstock, thereby confirming the versatility and efficiency of this process to produce a hydrogen-rich gas.
