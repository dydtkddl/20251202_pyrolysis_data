You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Staged pyrolysis of medical waste for high-value product generation: Impact of inter-component interactions on chlorine migration and light compounds formation Medical waste is highly hazardous, with its volume increasing annually. Staged pyrolysis is a pyrolysis technique that can improve the quality of pyrolysis products while reducing the generation of pollutants, which shows enormous potential for efficient disposal and resource recovery of medical waste. However, medical waste exhibits a highly complex composition. Interactions occur during the co-pyrolysis of multi-component feedstocks, significantly influencing pyrolysis behavior and product distribution. Therefore, this study investigated the interaction mechanisms during the low-temperature dechlorination stage (Stage I) and dechlorinated semi-char re-pyrolysis stage (Stage II) of medical waste staged pyrolysis, providing a theoretical basis for the clean and sustainable treatment of medical waste. In the low-temperature dechlorination stage, HCl interacted with gauze in the gas phase, lowering its decomposition temperature and releasing significant oxygenated volatiles. HCl also promoted the breakdown of plasticizers, producing chlorinated hydrocarbons. Gas-solid interactions partially inhibited HCl release, leading to adsorption and fixation on semi-char. In the dechlorinated semi-char re-pyrolysis stage, gas-phase interactions accelerated the denitrogenation of nitrogen-containing aromatics. In contrast, gas-solid interactions reduced the release of oxygenated functional groups, weakening CO and CO2 production. Additionally, gas-phase and gas-solid interactions promoted the removal of organic chlorine from oil and char, generating CH3Cl, with the gas-solid interactions having a more significant impact. This study revealed the impact of inter-component interactions on chlorine migration and light compounds formation during staged pyrolysis of medical waste, offering theoretical and technical support for efficient waste treatment and high-value product generation.
