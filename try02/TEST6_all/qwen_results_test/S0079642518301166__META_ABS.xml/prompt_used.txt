You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass derived hierarchical porous carbon materials as oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts in fuel cells Porous carbon materials (PCM) hold great promise for multifarious applications (like energy conversion and storage devices, biological applications, photo-catalysis etc.) owing to their outstanding properties such as high surface area, accessible active sites, mass transport, diffusion etc. Interestingly, they appear as futuristic substitutes to replace the conventional and economically unviable Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in Fuel cells. PCM synthesized using biomass-derived sources have some clear advantages, vis-a-vis. their abundance in nature, characteristic sustainability, economic viability and environmental friendliness. Also, no harsh chemicals are being used for their synthesis, and they inherently contain variety of heteroatoms (N, P, S etc.) vital for the electrocatalytic activity. This review article will help researchers gain an in-depth understanding of bio-waste sources and composition; synthesis methods and their dependence on various parameters; templating methods and vital information like role of dopants and transition metals in influencing electrocatalytic activity, and will result in enabling biomass based PCM as electrocatalysts in future energy devices.
