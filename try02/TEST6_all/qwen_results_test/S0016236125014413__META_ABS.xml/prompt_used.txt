You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast, ultradeep, and continuous desulfurization of heavy gasoil in novel oscillatory basket central baffled reactor using MnO2-incorparted Fe2O3- supported activated carbon catalyst To produce ultraclean fuel and reduce SOX emissions, the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) is the favorable promising alternative technology compared to the conventional hydrodesulfurization. Recently, oscillatory baffled reactor (OBR) is developed for continuous homogenous or batch heterogeneous catalytic ODS process. Up to now, there is no efficient design for handling the solid catalyst inside OBR for continuous heterogeneous desulfurization process. This study is focused on investigating the performance of novel design of oscillatory basket central baffled reactor (OBCBR) unit which solving the problem of handing the heterogeneous solid catalyst in the reactor by packing it in the baffle baskets for continuous and ultradeep ODS process. Novel dual fictionalized activated carbon (DFAC) loaded with manganese-iron oxides (5 % MnO2- 3 % Fe2O3/DFAC) catalyst is synthesized for removing of sulfur compounds from Iraqi real heavy gasoil (8291 ppm) using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as oxidant at mild process conditions: atmospheric pressure, temperatures (30 to 90 °C), residence times (3–12 min), oscillation frequencies (0.5–2 Hz), and amplitudes (3–12 mm). The results proved that the sulfur removal efficiency is significantly enhanced via increasing temperature, residence time, and oscillation conditions. The best removal efficiency was 99.54 % at 12 min, 90 °C, 2 Hz, and 12 mm. A remarkable enhancement in the desulfurization efficiency was conformed in the novel OBCBR within only 12 min compared to previous ODS works, which needed more than 1 hr to satisfy less sulfur removal efficiency. The interaction between MnO2 and Fe2O3 over activated carbon (AC) is remarkably enhanced the desulfurization efficiency due to provide more active sites, increase the adsorption capacity for sulfur compounds, and modify the pore structure and surface chemistry of AC. The synthesis catalyst attained a peripheral reduction in overall sulfur removal after five ODS cycles. The regeneration performance using different solvents through the continuous solvent regeneration (CSR) process are decreased based on the following order: iso-octane > ethanol > methanol > n-hexane. The regeneration efficiency of the novel catalyst is approximately 100 % after one regeneration cycle using iso-octane.
