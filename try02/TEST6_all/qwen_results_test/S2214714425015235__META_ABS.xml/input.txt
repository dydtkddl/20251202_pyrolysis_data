Design, synthesis, and structural engineering of carbon quantum dots and multifunctional N, P, B, S-doped CQDs for photocatalytic water purification Non-metal-doped CQDs have gained significant attention for their promising applications in photocatalytic degradation, particularly in water remediation. Doping heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, boron, and phosphorus into CQDs has demonstrated remarkable improvements in photocatalytic efficiency through enhanced charge separation, bandgap modulation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nitrogen doping enhances electron mobility and charge transfer, while sulfur doping tunes the bandgap and boosts visible-light absorption. Boron doping facilitates electron migration, and phosphorus doping increases active site density for pollutant degradation. Co-doped systems such as N, S-CQDs and N, P-CQDs leverage synergistic effects for superior photocatalytic performance. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in scaling synthesis methods and improving long-term stability. Future research should focus on eco-friendly synthesis approaches, advanced heteroatom doping techniques, and developing hybrid photocatalysts for industrial applications. These efforts will further advance the applicability of non-metal-doped CQDs in sustainable water treatment technologies.
