Structural effect of ZnZr2Ox catalysts on dehydrogenation: Mechanism of cracking The present work revealed the mechanism of various reactions during the dehydrogenation of propane, then elucidated the structural effects of binary ZnZr2Ox on the catalytic performance of catalysts. ZnZr2Ox with various crystal phases and crystal sizes were prepared. It revealed that the structure of catalysts affected the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) thus tuning the active sites of various reactions and influenced the diffusion of gas, all of which significantly influence catalytic performance. The ZnZr2Ox possessing a tetragonal ZrO2 phase exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to that possessing a ZnO phase. Furthermore, the smaller the grain, the higher the reducibility leading to more Ov accompanied by more active sites of hydrogenation, less active sites of cracking, and lower diffusion resistance, resulting in high catalytic performance. Therefore, the smallest ZnZr2-Hy(AP) nano-particles displayed the highest catalytic activity with respect to propene selectivity and stability.
