You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A bio-based flame retardant with micro core-shell structure and its effect on flame retardancy and mechanical properties of thermoplastic polyurethane The promotion of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was limited due to its flammability. Flame-retardant modification of TPU always leads to compromised mechanical properties. To address this issue, a bio-based flame retardant KPCMS with micro core-shell structure was developed in order to achieve superior fire resistance and enhanced mechanical properties in TPU. KPCMS demonstrated remarkable thermal stability with an initial decomposition temperature of 320 °C, and achieved an excellent char residue of 61.6 % at 800 °C. After introducing KPCMS into TPU, the mechanical properties, thermal stability, and flame retardancy were analyzed systematically. The enhanced interfacial interactions between polymer and KPCMS contributed to improvements in both tensile strength and elongation at break. Specifically, the tensile toughness of sample TPU/1 %KPCMS increased by 44.1 % compared with pure TPU. For sample TPU/3 %KPCMS, the residue increased from 4.0 % to 7.9 % at 800 °C compared with pure TPU, and increased by 38.6 % compared with the theoretical value. Sample TPU/1 %KPCMS exhibited an increased limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 24.5 %, passed the UL-94 V-0 rating, and showed improved anti-dripping behavior. The flame-retardant mechanism of TPU/KPCMS composites was derived from the synergism of barrier, quenching and dilution effects.
