Defluidization modelling of pyrolysis of plastics in a conical spouted bed reactor Thermal pyrolysis for upgrading plastic wastes is one of the better methods for recycling plastics in terms of its perspectives for industrial implementation. The conical spouted bed reactor proposed in this paper may be a solution to the problems arising in fluidized beds handling sticky solids, as particle agglomeration phenomena, which can cause defluidization. In order to avoid defluidization, experiments have been carried out in batch mode in the temperature range of 450–600°C. A good performance of the reactor is proven under the conditions of maximum particle stickiness.
