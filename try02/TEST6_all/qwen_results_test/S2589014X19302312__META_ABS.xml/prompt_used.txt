You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sulfur contaminations inhibit depolymerization of Kraft lignin Softwood Kraft lignin (s-KL) and methanol-fractionated extracted Kraft lignin (ex-KL) samples were thermally depolymerized via fractional (step-wise) pyrolysis at temperatures from 175 °C to 700 °C in an isothermal System for Thermal Diagnostic Studies (STDS) reactor. Major pyrolysis products include guaiacols, vanillins, phenols, syringols, and sulfur-containing compounds. Sulfur-containing compounds, as intrinsic contaminants (both adsorbed and covalently bound to KL matrixes), strongly inhibited the formation of pyrolysis products. The lesser the sulfur content in the KL matrix, the higher the yields of major pyrolysis products. The high yields and early release of tar components from pyrolysis of ex-KL were attributed to the initial pretreatment of s-KL (Soxhlet extraction in methanol) causing a decrease in sulfur content from 3.61% (s-KL) to 2.91% (ex-KL). Mechanistic explanations for the absence of sulfur-containing bio-oil products, inhibitory effect of sulfur-containing compounds, and the relatively high char content in depolymerization of both lignin substrates, are developed.
