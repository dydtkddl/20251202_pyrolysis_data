An overview of industrial scalable production of graphene oxide and analytical approaches for synthesis and characterization Herein, we provide an overview of the evolution of graphene oxide synthesis routes (GOSR). The oxidation of grapheneentails the applications of oxidizing agents which may affect the process parameters, synthesis and purity of graphene oxide. The utilization of potential oxidants has commonly reported for large scale production of graphene oxide. Traditional synthesis approaches have been limited by the properties of oxidizing reagents. Recently, various improved and modified Hummers methods (IHM/MHM) have emerged. The strengths and limitations of the conventional techniques have reported. Synthetic processes and characterization techniques have stated for the scale up synthesis of graphene oxide. This review could possibly provide the motivation to produce novel green methods for large scale production of graphene oxide.
