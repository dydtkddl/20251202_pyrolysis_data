Review of research and development on pyrolysis process Now a days disposal of plastic, rubber and Aluminium are big problem. Burning of agricultural wastes in open field is also gives serious threat to the environment. But they can be converted into useful products like heat, power, oil, gas, and biochar using Pyrolysis process. Many research works have been carried out to convert the harmful materials into useful by products. In this paper, pyrolyser used by various researchers are reviewed under the topics the various raw materials, temperature obtained and application. Some of the modified pyrolysers are also reviewed.
