You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the grading preparation of multifunctional materials and application from coal gasification fine slag Alkali activation at high temperatures serves as a significant method for the resource reuse of coal gasification fine slag (CGFS). This experimental approach used CGFS, coal-based solid waste, to prepare multifunctional materials and neither waste acid nor alkali was discharged in the process. Using this method, MCM-41 with hexagonal mesopores and carbon/zeolite composite with NaP-type zeolite structures were prepared hierarchically. It is noteworthy that this synthetic method incorporates Al from CGFS into MCM-41, which enhances the acidic sites of the material. This modification endows MCM-41 with potential application in catalyzing guaiacol. Under the same conditions, CGFS-based MCM-41 demonstrated the capacity to convert guaiacol into cyclohexane. In contrast, commercial MCM-41 exhibited the ability to catalyze the conversion of guaiacol into cyclohexanol and cyclohexane. At the same time, the carbon/zeolite composite retains the Fe in CGFS and can be used for the catalytic oxidative degradation of tetracycline. The carbon/zeolite composite was able to degrade 100 mL of 100 mg‧L−1 tetracycline solution by 99.38 % in 120 min at dose of 30 mg, an H2O2 concentration of 25 mmol‧L−1 and solution pH of 3. This research outlines a promising approach for the innovative concept of "turning waste into treasure."
