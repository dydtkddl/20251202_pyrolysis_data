Study on the grading preparation of multifunctional materials and application from coal gasification fine slag Alkali activation at high temperatures serves as a significant method for the resource reuse of coal gasification fine slag (CGFS). This experimental approach used CGFS, coal-based solid waste, to prepare multifunctional materials and neither waste acid nor alkali was discharged in the process. Using this method, MCM-41 with hexagonal mesopores and carbon/zeolite composite with NaP-type zeolite structures were prepared hierarchically. It is noteworthy that this synthetic method incorporates Al from CGFS into MCM-41, which enhances the acidic sites of the material. This modification endows MCM-41 with potential application in catalyzing guaiacol. Under the same conditions, CGFS-based MCM-41 demonstrated the capacity to convert guaiacol into cyclohexane. In contrast, commercial MCM-41 exhibited the ability to catalyze the conversion of guaiacol into cyclohexanol and cyclohexane. At the same time, the carbon/zeolite composite retains the Fe in CGFS and can be used for the catalytic oxidative degradation of tetracycline. The carbon/zeolite composite was able to degrade 100 mL of 100 mg‧L−1 tetracycline solution by 99.38 % in 120 min at dose of 30 mg, an H2O2 concentration of 25 mmol‧L−1 and solution pH of 3. This research outlines a promising approach for the innovative concept of "turning waste into treasure."
