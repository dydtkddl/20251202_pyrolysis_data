You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental studies and molecular modelling of catalytic steam gasification of brown coal containing iron species The paper presents experimental data of catalytic steam gasification of brown coal containing aqua-iron species, and the chemical mechanism(s) at a molecular level. Experimental techniques provided weight loss from catalysed reaction of char with steam of 17wt% at 800°C and 40wt% at 900°C, over 15min, on a dry ash free basis (daf). Inorganic and organic oxygen, identified using XPS in the char samples, was derived from reactions with steam. High yields of H2 resulted from catalysed reactions between char and steam. Semi-empirical (SE) quantum molecular modelling using MOPAC, of reaction routes for high temperature pyrolysis and steam gasification, provided results consistent with experimental data for weight loss, iron species, and the distribution of inorganic and organic oxygen in char samples after reaction with steam. The catalysis mechanism(s) that have been examined are considered to be a hybrid of organometallic and heterogeneous chemistry, involving iron hydride species that precede H2 formation; oxygen insertion into [Fe–C–] to form [Fe–O–C–] followed by elimination of CO, creating another [Fe–C] site to continue the catalytic cycle. SE modelling indicates concerted reactions were more energetically favoured. Initial results from molecular dynamics (MD) show a higher concentration of H2O molecules about the active site [Fe–C].
