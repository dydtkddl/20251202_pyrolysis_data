You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic conversion of waste plastics to energy products: A review on yields, properties, and production costs In recent years, about 370 million tonnes of waste plastic are generated annually with about 9 % recycled, 80 % landfilled and 11 % converted to energy. As recycling of waste plastics are quite expensive and labour-intensive, the focus has now been shifted towards converting waste plastics into energy products. Pyrolysis of waste plastic generates liquid oil (crude), gas, char and wax among which liquid oil is the most valuable product. In this review, emphasis has been given on the pyrolysis products yield from both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis and the factors that affect pyrolysis products yield. The use of homogenous catalysts, for example AlCl3, can significantly improve the quality of waste plastic pyrolytic oil (WPPO), reduce time and energy consumption of the process, and help remove the contaminants of waste plastic. This study also thoroughly reviewed physico-chemical properties of WPPO to understand their thermal stability, elemental composition, and functional groups. Although liquid oil exhibits comparable heating value with commercial fuel (diesel/petrol), for example higher heating value of Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene (PE) are 50 and 42 MJ/kg which is between 42 and 46 MJ/kg for commercial diesel the other properties depend on several parameters such as plastic and pyrolysis reactor types, temperature, feed size, reaction time, heating rate and catalysts. A techno-economic analysis indicate that the liquid oil production cost could be about 0.6 USD/l if plant capacity is ≥175,000 million litres/year with a breakeven of 1 year. After-treatment of WPPO through distillation and hydrotreatment is recommended for improving the physio-chemical properties comparable to commercial fuel to use in automobile applications. This paper will be a valuable guide for stakeholders, and decision and policy makers for proper utilization of waste plastics.
