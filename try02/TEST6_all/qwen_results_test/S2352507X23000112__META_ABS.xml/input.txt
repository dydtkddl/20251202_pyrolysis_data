Recent advances in various processes for clean and sustainable hydrogen production Hydrogen has received significant attention as a promising clean energy alternative to petroleum derivatives. The low-cost production and storage of hydrogen are essential factors in achieving a cost-effective hydrogen economy. The non-toxic nature of its emissions as well as its high energy content, makes this fuel to be more valuable in the future. Hydrogen is currently widely used in various industries and is produced largely by thermochemical, photobiological, photocatalytic and electrochemical processes. Although substantial progress has been made in developing alternative hydrogen generation methods, additional technical advancement and cost reduction are still required for them to be competitive with current large-scale reforming technology. This review describes the developments in producing hydrogen energy using various methods (thermochemical, photobiological, photocatalytic and electrochemical), along with their future aspects for improving clean and sustainable hydrogen production.
