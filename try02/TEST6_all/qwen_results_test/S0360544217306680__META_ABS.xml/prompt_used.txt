You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gas–solid thermochemical heat storage reactors for high-temperature applications Reversible reactions exhibit considerable potential for thermal energy storage because of their high energy density and capability for long-term storage at ambient temperature. This paper presents the research progress on gas–solid thermochemical heat storage reactors and their corresponding systems. The comprehensive state-of-the-art knowledge on gas–solid thermochemical reactors, namely, packed bed, continuous, and direct-type reactors, for high-temperature heat storage applications is reviewed. Up till now, the performance of packed bed reactors has been extensively investigated. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of packed bed reactors limit their applications. Continuous and direct-type reactors can efficiently store heat, but studies on these reactors are still on the stage of material characterization and prototype designing. Various numerical studies have successfully predicted the reaction trends in the three reactors to elucidate their performances and features. In these studies, porous thermochemical materials are studied on the scale of representative element volume. So far, numerical or experimental approaches have been rarely used to investigate physical and chemical processes at the particle scale. Energy and exergy analyses on conceptual thermochemical heat storage systems came into existence recently. In the future, more efficiency analyses based on practical experimental results are required.
