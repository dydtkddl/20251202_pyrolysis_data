You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-free electrocatalytic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes using bifunctional biochar cathode: adsorption-coupled electrocatalytic reduction mechanism Electrochemical reductive dechlorination provides an environmentally friendly and sustainable method for the remediation of chlorinated ethenes (CEs) without chemical additives. However, the limited mass and electron transfer of commonly commercial electrodes restricts surface reactions with CEs. Herein, metal-free biochars (BCs) with high adsorption capacity (22.68∼51.32 mg/g) and conductivity (84∼303 Ω) were utilized as cathode materials for the effective dechlorination of CEs. The BC900 cathode exhibited a dechlorination efficiency of 98.14 % for 10 mg/L trichloroethylene (TCE) within 24 h, with a kobs of 0.161 h⁻¹ under an applied potential of -1.0 V. Carbon balance and chloride form analyses indicated that nearly all CCl bonds were cleaved, with ethylene and acetylene identified as the primary end products. Quenching, kinetic, and electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the dechlorination process involves a direct electron transfer reduction pathway via conductive structures of BCs. Moreover, the synergistic effect on TCE dechlorination was superior to that of commercial electrocatalysts, achieving high reusability and wide adaptability in environmental water. This methodology can also be extrapolated to other CEs, including tetrachloroethylene, cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. These findings highlight an adsorption-coupled electrochemical reductive dechlorination mechanism for CEs, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of high-performance, biomass-based electrocatalysts in environmental applications.
