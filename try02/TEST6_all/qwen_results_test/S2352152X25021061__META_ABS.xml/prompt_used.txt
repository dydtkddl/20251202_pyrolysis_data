You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvent-induced structural insight into improved electrochemical performance of olivine type high-voltage lithium cobalt phosphate cathode materials The increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries with high energy density has driven research into olivine-type high-voltage cathode materials. However, the development of these materials is hindered by two significant challenges: poor electronic conductivity and a low lithium-ion diffusion coefficient. Herein, carbon-coated LiCoPO4 materials were synthesized using precursors with different space groups via a solvothermal method, employing a binary mixture of diethylene glycol (DEG) and water as solvents. The influence of the solvent ratio on space group regulation, structural characteristics, and electrochemical performance was systematically investigated. When the solvent ratio (VDEG: VH2O) is <2.3, the resulting cathode material exhibits a pure phase belonging to the Pnma space group. Conversely, when the solvent ratio exceeds this threshold, a metastable phase corresponding to the Pn21a space group is formed. Electrochemical testing revealed that the performance of LiCoPO4 materials in the Pnma space group significantly surpasses that of materials in the Pn21a space group. Notably, the LiCoPO4/C material synthesized with a VDEG: VH2O ratio of 2.3, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group, demonstrates the most outstanding performance among the samples studied. This material achieves a specific discharge capacity of 157.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and 91.9 mAh g−1 at 2C. Additionally, the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient of this material reaches 1.01 × 10−14 cm2 s−1. In summary, the electronic conductivity and lithium-ion diffusion coefficient of LiCoPO4 were effectively enhanced through carbon coating and precise control of the crystal phase of the primary grains. This study provides valuable insights into strategies for further improving the performance of polyanionic-based cathode materials, offering a foundation for future advancements in high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.
