You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling of decommissioned wind turbine blades through pyrolysis The worldwide installed capacity of wind power currently stands at 743 GW to offset 1.1 billion tons of CO2 emissions. However, extensive wind energy usage has led to the accumulation of large numbers of decommissioned wind turbine blades. This has become a major environmental issue. Unlike other parts of wind turbines (e.g., nacelle, tower, and foundation), wind turbine blades are typically made of fiber (carbon fiber or glass fiber)-reinforced lightweight polymer composites. Because of the inhomogeneity and complicated nature of these blades, their recycling is economically challenging. Pyrolysis can be a promising option to produce energy and useful materials through recycling of complicated inhomogeneous waste substances. Thus, pyrolytic recycling of decommissioned wind turbine blades would become a solution not only for their disposal but also for the recovery of high-value products (i.e., upcycling of decommissioned wind turbine blades). To gain a better knowledge of an effective end-of-life option for processing wind turbine blades, literature survey was also carried out extensively to cover the existing pyrolysis processes for the recovery of materials and energy from decommissioned wind turbine blades for the first time. The challenges associated with the pyrolysis of wind turbine blade materials are discussed, along with future perspectives in this research field.
