Performance assessment of packed bed reactor and catalytic membrane reactor for steam reforming of methane through metal foam catalyst support A kinetic model for the methane steam reforming has been investigated. The performances are compared between the packed bed reactor and catalytic membrane reactor with metal foam catalyst support. The effects of various variables such as pressure, temperature of the reaction, ratio of methane to steam in feed, thickness of membrane and sweep gas on the total methane conversion and hydrogen production were investigated qualitatively. The comparison between these two types of reactors was carried out in the temperature range of 350 °C–750 °C and pressure range of 2–30 bar. Isothermal modeling has been performed and showed a higher performance of the membrane reactor rather than the packed bed reactor. Methane conversion can be reached 100% for lower temperatures than used with industrial PBR, and better performances are reached with an increase of the operating pressure. The maximum conversion of methane for the CMR is quickly reached while the conversion evolution observed for the PBR is smoother.
