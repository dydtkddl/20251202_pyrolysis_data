You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deactivation of the preferential oxidation of CO in packed bed reactor by 3D modelling and near-infrared tomography Scaling up the results on catalyst deactivation to industrial operations, where transport phenomena are of significance, is often not straightforward. The operations of industrial reactors are judiciously focused on the dynamics of the deactivation along the axial length of the reactors, which are generally known approximately. Processes of strong energy release or fast chemical kinetics, such as oxidation reactions, cracking, etc., are associated with a deactivation where the time characteristics of the flow and transports are of magnitudes of the deactivation time-on-stream. Local deactivation of the preferential oxidation of CO was investigated by three-dimensional modelling of flow, mass and heat transfers inside a packed-bed reactor and validated by near-infrared tomography. The profiles of deactivation were sensitive to the rates of deactivation, heat transfer by dispersion and intra-particle mass transfer. At pore scale of the packing, pronounced deactivation was revealed near the wall due to a preferential flow circulation. The deactivation progressed at the exteriors of the catalytic particles, particularly over the regions in contact with the convective flow. Unlike the mass dispersion, the heat dispersion promoted the deactivation by shifting the moving waves of deactivation upstream, leading to asymmetrical maps inside the catalytic particles.
