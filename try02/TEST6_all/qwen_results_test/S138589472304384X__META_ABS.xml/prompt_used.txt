You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation of microplastics during wet air oxidation treatment Microplastics (MPs) are emerging contaminants in ecology and environment. Most of MPs in sewage are finally enriched in sludge during biological wastewater treatment, and they could be released to soil or natural water bodies along with land use of sludge. It is a key step to cut off the transfer of microplastics from human activities to nature, especially via sewage treatment and discharge. Wet air oxidation (WAO), a promising sludge treatment technology, should have a potential to degrade MPs during sludge treatment since it can destroy complex and resistant organic substances. In this study, this guess was tested, and the degradation of three common MPs, i.e., polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in WAO was investigated through a series of WAO experiments. The results showed that cracks, holes, and oxygen-containing groups occurred in the surface of MPs, and the particles were rapidly dissolved within 15 min at 240 °C and oxygen pressure of 2 MPa. Hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) generated in WAO played a key role, which was contributed to depolymerize MPs into alkyl compounds (alkane, aceton, etc.), and alkyl radicals and further degrade into low molecular aldehydes and ketones, finally into short chain carboxylic acids, even CO2 and H2O. After 120 min WAO treatment, 43.6% of PEMPs, 68.2% of PSMPs, and 0.9% of PETMPs were mineralized to CO2, respectively, and only 23.8% of PEMPs, 5.8% of PSMPs, and 77.3% of PETMPs remained in residues. These findings confirmed the advantage and potential of WAO in controlling the release of MPs sludge to environment.
