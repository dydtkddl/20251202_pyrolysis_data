You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene on cobalt- immobilized nitrogen-doped carbon: A dual-sites synergistic effect between cobalt single atoms and cobalt nanoparticles Non-precious catalysts are a potential candidate for highly efficient conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline if these catalysts can work under mild conditions. Here, we developed a catalyst (Co(SA+NPs)-C/N) by depositing Co species on nitrogen-doped carbon support with a pyrolysis route under a nitrogen atmosphere. As two forms of Co species, both single atom cobalt (Co(SA)) and cobalt nanoparticles (Co(NPs)) were distributed on the surface of the catalyst particles. These two forms of Co species provided a synergistic effect (dual-sites effect) on the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. Using water as a solvent, the optimized Co(SA+NPs)-C/N catalyst yielded a full conversion of nitrobenzene into aniline at room temperature within 2.5 min in the presence of NaBH4 with a molar ratio of –NO2: NaBH4 = 1: 3. The observed catalytic activity of Co(SA+NPs)-C/N was much higher than that of the catalyst with only single atom cobalt (Co(SA)-C/N) or only cobalt nanoparticles (Co(NPs)-C/N). The synergistic dual-sites effect is assigned as that Co nanoparticle sites contribute enough sites for the adsorption of nitrobenzene and its intermediates, while the dispersed Co atom sites boost the dissociation of NaBH4 molecules to active H atoms. The Co(SA+NPs)-C/N catalyst was able to smoothly work at a wide temperature range of 15-45°C, being highly stable with a recycling number of at least ten. This work not only opens up a new approach for the transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, but also deepens the knowledge on their hydrogenation mechanism.
