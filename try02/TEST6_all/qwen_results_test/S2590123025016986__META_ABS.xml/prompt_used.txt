You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic impact of cerium oxide nano additive along with produced-HHO gas on CI engine behaviors running with pyrolyzed waste plastic oil The gain sustainable energy from waste plastic decreases the dependence on fossil fuel. Waste plastics were converted to oil by pyrolysis which combined with pure diesel in 20 % volumetrically. Oil's physical and chemical characteristics were measured. Nano cerium oxide was added to the oil mixture at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 ppm. Oxyhydrogen gas (HHO) was formed by water electrolysis using an alkaline electrolyser at 0.5 litres per minute. Experiments were run at engine speed of 3000 rpm and load variation. When HHO was added to pyrolysis oil, CeO2 mixtures (P20C25, P20C50, and P20C100) improved thermal efficiency by 11, 12, and 13 % and reduced specific fuel consumption by 10, 11, and 14 %, respectively. Addition of 25, 50, and 100 ppm nano CeO2 to pyrolysis oil with HHO resulted in notable decreases of CO concentrations by 15 %, 19 %, and 22 % about P20. There were decreases in smoke concentrations of 25 %, 29 %, and 32 %, along with notable decreases in hydrocarbon emissions of 27 %, 30 %, and 35 % for P20C25 + HHO, P20C50 + HHO, and P20C100 + HHO, respectively. Enrichment with hydroxy to oil blend that contained 25, 50, and 100 ppm of nanoparticles reduced NOx emissions by 19 %, 22 %, and 26 %, respectively. There were improvements in heat release rate and cylinder pressure for oil mixture with nano additives and hydroxy. Pyrolysis oil from waste plastic that has been enhanced with 100 ppm cerium oxide and HHO can be applied to reduce exhaust pollutants, improve combustion, and boost engine performance.
