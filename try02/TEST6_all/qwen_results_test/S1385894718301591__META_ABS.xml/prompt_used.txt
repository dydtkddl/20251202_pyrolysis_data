You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation mechanism and kinetic modeling for UV/peroxydisulfate treatment of penicillin antibiotics The widespread occurrence of penicillin antibiotics (PENs) in natural environment has raised increasing concerns due to their potential to induce antibiotic-genes. In this study, the degradation of PENs by UV/peroxodisulfate (PDS) process was investigated to determine the reaction kinetics, transformation mechanism and energy efficiency. The second-order rate constants for sulfate radical (SO4 − ) and hydroxyl radical (HO) with PENs, including, pencillin G (PG), amoxicillin (AMX) and carbenicillin (CBN), were determined to be (3.90–9.32) × 109 M−1·s−1 and (6.67–9.86) × 109 M−1·s−1, respectively. A pseudo steady-state kinetic model was employed and successfully predicted the degradation of PENs in ultrapure water. The modeling results revealed that both direct and indirect photolysis contributed to PENs degradation, and the contribution of indirect photolysis increased with the increase of PDS dosage. SO4 − was the major contributor to PENs indirect photolysis. The effect of pH and water matrices, including HCO3 −, Cl− and natural organic matter were evaluated and modeled. Combined with the modeling results, the derived radicals and excited species were likely generated and involved in the overall degradation of PENs. Based on the developed model, we gave a roughly calculation of electrical energy per order (EE/O) to evaluate the energy efficiency of PDS treatment processes. Finally, the transformation product analysis indicated that the thioether sulfur on the five-membered ring and the side chain, e.g., benzene ring on PG and CBN were the reactive sites for SO4 − , while the primary amine was another reactive site for SO4 − on AMX.
