You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study of erosion in a high-temperature fluidized bed with granular materials for concentrated solar power applications Interest in concentrated solar power plants using fluidized solid particles is growing because they offer several advantages, namely, the use of a renewable energy source, the use of the same power cycle technology that conventional fossil fuel power plants or energy storage capabilities. Nonetheless, the use of solid particles means that heat exchangers or internal devices are exposed to a highly erosive environment. This experimental study assesses the evolution of the erosivity of a fluidized bed with fluidization velocity and temperature using bars made of aggregated calcium carbonate immersed in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed of particles suitable for concentrated solar power applications: silica sand and silicon carbide. The mass loss after a given exposure time was measured to obtain a set of experimental data under different temperature and fluidization velocity conditions. Then, the circumferential-averaged erosion rate was estimated. In the case of silica sand, erosion at 100 ℃ was consistently minimum for each fluidization velocity, suggesting a change in the fluidization regime. In the case of silicon carbide, the results point to changes from bubbling to slugging and bubbling to turbulent transitions at low temperature (rounding 100 ℃) and around 400 ℃, respectively. On average, the erosivity of silicon carbide was up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of silica sand. For instance, at 20 ℃ and under similar bubbling fluidization velocity, the erosion rate of silicon carbide was 482 μ m /h, while that of silica sand was about 3 μ m /h.
