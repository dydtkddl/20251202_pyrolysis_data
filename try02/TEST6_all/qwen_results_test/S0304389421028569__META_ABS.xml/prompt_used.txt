You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption modeling, thermodynamics, and DFT simulation of tetracycline onto mesoporous and high-surface-area NaOH-activated macroalgae carbon Activated carbon (ENAC) was prepared by NaOH activation, using macroalgae (Enteromorpha clathrate) as raw material. The prepared activated carbon has a large surface area (1238.491 m2 g−1) and its total pore volume and average pore size are 0.6823 cm3g−1 and 2.2038 nm, respectively. The ENAC was characterized by SEM, FTIR, BET and XPS. The effects of contact time (0–960 min), initial tetracycline (TC) concentration (50–500 mg L−1), temperature (30–50 °C) and initial pH (2–11) on TC adsorption were evaluated. The adsorption isotherm and adsorption kinetics were discussed. Results showed that the adsorption isotherm was the Langmuir model, and the adsorption process can be described by the pseudo-second-order model. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was type IV, indicating that the activated carbon had mesoporous structure. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. The maximum adsorption capacity of TC was 381.584 mg g−1. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to simulate and analyze the adsorption process, and the influence of different types of N on the adsorption was expounded. The results showed that there are electrostatic interactions, π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent and TC. These results indicated that the prepared ENAC had a great application prospect in the removal of antibiotics from aqueous solution.
