You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of an activated carbon from hazelnut shells and its hybrids with magnetic NiFe2O4 nanoparticles A low cost activated carbon was prepared from hazelnut shells by chemical activation with sodium hydroxide at 600 °C in a N2 atmosphere and then combined with magnetic NiFe2O4 nanoparticles by hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods. Samples were characterized by FESEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, nitrogen adsorption and magnetic measurements. Results indicated that the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the hydrothermal method had a higher saturation magnetization and smaller average particle size than those produced by the co-precipitation method. The specific surface area and total pore volume of the activated carbon decreased from 314 to 288 m2/g and 0.3639 to 0.3338 cm3/g, respectively by forming a hybrid with the magnetic NiFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the hydrothermal method. NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were mainly distributed on the surface, although a few were inside the pores of the activated carbon. Their sizes were the same as those of the original ones. The saturation magnetization of the hybrids was lower than those of the original NiFe2O4 nanoparticles due to the existence of the activated carbon. They showed superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature and were easily separated from solutions by an external magnet.
