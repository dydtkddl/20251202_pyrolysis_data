Comprehensive review on advanced coordination chemistry and nanocomposite strategies for wastewater microplastic remediation via adsorption and photocatalysis The persistence of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater has posed alarming and growing environmental, ecological, and health challenges. This review focuses on the decontamination of MPs from wastewater via adsorption and photocatalytic degradation processes using nanocomposites (NCs), which are advantageous due to their large specific surface area, scalable chemical functionality, and ability to form ligands with MPs, thereby promoting the selectivity and sensitivity of treatment processes. The adsorption mechanism relies on the interaction between MP molecules and NCs' polar, organic, ionic, metallic, and hydrophobic surface ligands via hydrogen, electrostatic, van der Waals, or π-π bonds. Photocatalytic degradation involves the MPs' molecular decomposition, generating environmentally friendly by-products that are far less damaging. Metal ligands in NC-based catalysts effectively enhance the degradation of MPs. In addition, the efficiency, stability, and reusability of NCs were highlighted, while scalability for practical applications was considered. Furthermore, the manuscript addressed the challenges of NC synthesis, environmental safety, compliance with relevant treatment process regulations, and the cost of applying NCs to industrial MP disposal. This paper provides a roadmap for mitigating MP wastewater pollution while promoting sustainability and aquatic ecosystem protection. It presents strategic recommendations for the nanotechnology processes to strengthen the circular economy and preserve natural resources.
