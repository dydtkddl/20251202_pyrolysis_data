You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review on advanced coordination chemistry and nanocomposite strategies for wastewater microplastic remediation via adsorption and photocatalysis The persistence of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater has posed alarming and growing environmental, ecological, and health challenges. This review focuses on the decontamination of MPs from wastewater via adsorption and photocatalytic degradation processes using nanocomposites (NCs), which are advantageous due to their large specific surface area, scalable chemical functionality, and ability to form ligands with MPs, thereby promoting the selectivity and sensitivity of treatment processes. The adsorption mechanism relies on the interaction between MP molecules and NCs' polar, organic, ionic, metallic, and hydrophobic surface ligands via hydrogen, electrostatic, van der Waals, or π-π bonds. Photocatalytic degradation involves the MPs' molecular decomposition, generating environmentally friendly by-products that are far less damaging. Metal ligands in NC-based catalysts effectively enhance the degradation of MPs. In addition, the efficiency, stability, and reusability of NCs were highlighted, while scalability for practical applications was considered. Furthermore, the manuscript addressed the challenges of NC synthesis, environmental safety, compliance with relevant treatment process regulations, and the cost of applying NCs to industrial MP disposal. This paper provides a roadmap for mitigating MP wastewater pollution while promoting sustainability and aquatic ecosystem protection. It presents strategic recommendations for the nanotechnology processes to strengthen the circular economy and preserve natural resources.
