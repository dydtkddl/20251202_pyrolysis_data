You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrokinetics couples with the adsorption of activated carbon-supported hydroxycarbonate green rust that enhances the removal of Sr cations from the stock solution in batch and column Activated carbon-supported hydroxycarbonate green rust (GR-AC) was prepared, characterized, and used to remove Sr2+ ions from stock solutions. The electrokinetics coupling with the adsorption was further designed to enhance the uptake of Sr2+ ions in the fixed-bed column. The adsorption capacities (mg/g) of GR-AC experienced a U-shaped change over the pH of 2–13 for each concentration of Sr2+. The equilibrium adsorption capacities for the adsorbent in the initial concentrations of Sr2+ of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mg/g were 48.36, 67.42, 73.25, 81.59, and 84.47, respectively. The pseudo-first-order and Elovich kinetic models were appropriate for modeling the adsorption of Sr2+ onto the GR-AC in the static equilibrium-adsorption experiments in terms of the whole pH range, while the intraparticle model was only suitable for the modeling in the alkaline aqueous environment. For the column-mode experiments, the changes in the voltage gradients, flow rates, and initial pH all had a significant effect on the removal of Sr2+ cations. A maximum breakthrough volume of 26.52 L was obtained in the orthogonal design. The correspondingly optimal combination of parameters determined for the column-mode experiments included the voltage gradient of 1.0 V/cm, the initial pH of 10, and a relatively slow flow rate of 5–15 mL/min. The application of EK enhanced the removal kinetics of Sr2+ from the stock solutions while had not significantly affected the interactions between Sr2+ and GR-AC. The specific reaction pathways determined for the Sr2+ removal was different with different pH ranges. The research provides an efficient method for removing radioactive Sr from wastewater in the future.
