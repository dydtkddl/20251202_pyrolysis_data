Platelet graphene nanofiber growth on rice husk-sourced SiO2-coated substrates and their behavior in PVA-based temperature sensing devices Platelet graphene nanofibers (PGNFs) with diameter ranging from a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers and length extending into the micrometer scale were grown on rice husk-derived C-SiO2 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the presence of a Co/Mn catalyst and ethanol vapor at 650 °C. At this temperature, PGNF formation was sensitive to the carbon concentration in the growth atmosphere. The Co/Mn catalyst, the growth atmosphere, and the C-SiO2 surface determined PGNF formation. The C-SiO2/PGNF micro/nanostructured composite material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The material was incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and PVA-C-SiO2/PGNF discs with diameter of 7 mm were placed on Ag/Kapton foil electrodes to create temperature sensors. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the sensors depended on the PGNF concentration and ranged from −0.66 to −0.41 %/°C for 5 wt% C-SiO2/PGNFs and 0.5 wt% C-SiO2/PGNFs, respectively. On the basis of these results, C-SiO2/PGNFs can serve as an alternative additive to develop PVA-based plastic temperature sensors with enhanced thermal stability.
