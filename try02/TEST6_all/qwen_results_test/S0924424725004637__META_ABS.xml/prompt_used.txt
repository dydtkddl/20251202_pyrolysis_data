You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Platelet graphene nanofiber growth on rice husk-sourced SiO2-coated substrates and their behavior in PVA-based temperature sensing devices Platelet graphene nanofibers (PGNFs) with diameter ranging from a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers and length extending into the micrometer scale were grown on rice husk-derived C-SiO2 via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the presence of a Co/Mn catalyst and ethanol vapor at 650 °C. At this temperature, PGNF formation was sensitive to the carbon concentration in the growth atmosphere. The Co/Mn catalyst, the growth atmosphere, and the C-SiO2 surface determined PGNF formation. The C-SiO2/PGNF micro/nanostructured composite material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The material was incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and PVA-C-SiO2/PGNF discs with diameter of 7 mm were placed on Ag/Kapton foil electrodes to create temperature sensors. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the sensors depended on the PGNF concentration and ranged from −0.66 to −0.41 %/°C for 5 wt% C-SiO2/PGNFs and 0.5 wt% C-SiO2/PGNFs, respectively. On the basis of these results, C-SiO2/PGNFs can serve as an alternative additive to develop PVA-based plastic temperature sensors with enhanced thermal stability.
