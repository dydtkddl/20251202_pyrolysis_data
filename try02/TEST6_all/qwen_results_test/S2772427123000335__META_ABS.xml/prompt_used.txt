You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling of biomass waste from durian industry for green and sustainable applications: An analysis review in the Malaysia context Durian with high nutritional value is cultivated mainly in tropical countries especially in Southeast Asia. The high annual durian production volume of approximately 350,000 MT in Malaysia has led to the abundance of durian biomass waste. Biochar derived from durian biomass waste has huge potential for sustainable applications in various fields. In this paper, durian biomass waste generation and management system in Malaysia are first discussed. The estimated potential energy available in Malaysia from durian biomass waste is then presented followed by the discussion on the conversion of durian biomass waste into biochar through pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization. Applications of durian biochar as catalysts, bio-sorbents for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater, biocomposite, fertilizers, supercapacitor electrode material, and briquettes have also been reviewed. Moreover, this paper highlights the potential applications of durian biochar-derived biodegradable mulch film and supercapacitor electrode material in Malaysia to tackle both plastic waste and energy storage issues. Besides biochar, production and applications of bio-oil, biogas and other valuable compounds from durian biomass waste are also discussed. Furthermore, the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0) on the durian industry in Malaysia which includes Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and autonomous systems, sustainability assessment tools as well as the challenges are discussed. Based on the work presented, despite Malaysia has great potential in upcycling the durian biomass waste for several applications, more in-depth researches are necessary to further solidify the promising application in the specific field and improve production planning of durian fruit while valorizing durian biomass waste which makes up about 19% of total durian biomass waste from major durian producers from Southeast Asia.
