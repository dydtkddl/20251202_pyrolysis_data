You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergetic effect of co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and lignin on biochar production and adsorption of methylene blue Much attention has been drawn to co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) and biomass, to obtain high-quality biochar by combining the favorable properties of both feedstocks. In our study, pyrolysis of SS, lignin and their mixtures (weight ratio of 50%) were carried out in a fixed bed reactor and thermogravimetric analyzer/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC). The synergy of feedstocks during co-pyrolysis at 400 ℃, 600 ℃ and 800 ℃ was investigated. The experiments were designed using response surface methodology (RSM) to investigate the influence of temperature, retention time and doping ratio on the biochar yields and their adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB). From the TG results, decomposition of the mixture was promoted by the synergetic effect, and the reaction temperature was reduced from 741 ℃ to 688 ℃. DSC curves proved the synergetic reaction being endothermic around 750 ℃. The biochar yields varied between 0.46 and 0.75, while the MB adsorption capacity varied between 3.06 and 38.56 mg g−1. The MB adsorption capacity was improved by the synergy effect. The excellent MB adsorption property of biochar was attributed to abundant function groups produced at 400 ℃ (OH, CH, and C = O) and elevated specific surface areas at 800 ℃ (33.59 m2 g−1).
