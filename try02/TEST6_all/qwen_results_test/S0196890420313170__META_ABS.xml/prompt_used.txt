You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-catalysis of different waste plastics over Fe/Al2O3 catalyst: High-value hydrogen, liquid fuels, carbon nanotubes and possible reaction mechanisms To understand the correlation between plastic structure and products, and the possible reaction mechanisms, the pyrolysis–catalysis of different types of waste plastics was investigated in the presence of an Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. Polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS) were used as the feedstock. The results showed that PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed higher H2-enriched gaseous product yields (>40 wt%), but higher H2 concentration (over 70 vol%) was obtained from the gaseous products of HIPS and GPPS. In terms of liquid oil, the yield exhibited a relatively stable tendency, which was ~ 20 wt%, and the liquid product comprised hydrocarbons with a carbon number range mainly between 8 and 16. For solid carbon deposits, HIPS waste plastic led to a higher solid deposit yield of 49.4 wt%, followed by GPPS of 48.7 wt%. By contrast, PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed lower yields of 30.2 wt%, 36.9 wt%, and 35.9 wt%, respectively. In summary, more, purer and cleaner carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be obtained from pyrolysis–catalysis of polyolefin (PP and PE), while more amorphous carbon and hydrogen were gathered from PS.
