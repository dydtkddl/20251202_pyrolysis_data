You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green and blue hydrogen production and purification technologies Hydrogen, with its high energy density and environmentally friendly nature, stands out as an ideal candidate for a sustainable energy future. With the increase in global energy demand and depletion of fossil fuel supplies, the importance of hydrogen in the “hydrogen economy” is growing day by day. This review critically summarizes the methodologies employed in the production of blue and green hydrogen, with a particular emphasis on the advanced techniques and cutting-edge methodologies used for the separation and purification procedures. Further, it highlights key strategies for improving industrial processes and provides ecologically sustainable and efficient technological approaches for production. This review is in line with international efforts to promote the use of renewable energy, with the goal of addressing air pollution and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, this review offers a thorough and up-to-date overview of hydrogen separation and purification technologies from carbon dioxide (CO2) and other trace impurities by utilizing unique methodology and approaches. In addition, it emphasizes the significance of employing sophisticated purification methods, such as membrane separation, pressure swing adsorption and cryogenic distillation, to attain the high level of purity necessary for certain applications. Effective methods for isolating, producing, and purifying hydrogen are crucial in order to fully harness its potential as a renewable energy source.
