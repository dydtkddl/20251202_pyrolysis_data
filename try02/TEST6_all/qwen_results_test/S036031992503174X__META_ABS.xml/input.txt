Green and blue hydrogen production and purification technologies Hydrogen, with its high energy density and environmentally friendly nature, stands out as an ideal candidate for a sustainable energy future. With the increase in global energy demand and depletion of fossil fuel supplies, the importance of hydrogen in the “hydrogen economy” is growing day by day. This review critically summarizes the methodologies employed in the production of blue and green hydrogen, with a particular emphasis on the advanced techniques and cutting-edge methodologies used for the separation and purification procedures. Further, it highlights key strategies for improving industrial processes and provides ecologically sustainable and efficient technological approaches for production. This review is in line with international efforts to promote the use of renewable energy, with the goal of addressing air pollution and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, this review offers a thorough and up-to-date overview of hydrogen separation and purification technologies from carbon dioxide (CO2) and other trace impurities by utilizing unique methodology and approaches. In addition, it emphasizes the significance of employing sophisticated purification methods, such as membrane separation, pressure swing adsorption and cryogenic distillation, to attain the high level of purity necessary for certain applications. Effective methods for isolating, producing, and purifying hydrogen are crucial in order to fully harness its potential as a renewable energy source.
