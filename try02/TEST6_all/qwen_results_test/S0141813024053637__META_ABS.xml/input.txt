Vanillin-based flame retardant enables polylactic acid high-efficiency fireproof, anti-UV and oxygen barrier for food packaging Polylactic acid (PLA) is widely known for its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high transparency. However, it still has varied limitations such as flammability, UV sensitivity, and poor oxygen barrier properties. To address these issues, a bio-based compound, hexasubstituted cyclotriphosphazene (HVP), was synthesized by using vanillin and hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene to enhance the overall performance of PLA. The resulting PLA/HVP composites demonstrated improved mechanical strength and UV resistance. Specifically, PLA/3HVP, with a 3 wt% HVP loading, achieved a UL-94 V-0 rating and a high limiting oxygen index of 26.5 %. Cone calorimeter tests revealed that PLA/3HVP possessed a significantly longer ignition time and a lower peak heat release rate compared to pure PLA. These burning testing results indicated the enhanced fire resistance. Additionally, the oxygen transmission rate of PLA/3HVP was reduced by 81.1 % compared to pure PLA. When used as food packaging, the weight loss of mangoes covered with PLA/3HVP film was 2.2 % after 7 days, compared to 2.5 % with pure PLA film, highlighting its potential for food preservation applications.
