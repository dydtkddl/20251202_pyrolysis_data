You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vanillin-based flame retardant enables polylactic acid high-efficiency fireproof, anti-UV and oxygen barrier for food packaging Polylactic acid (PLA) is widely known for its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high transparency. However, it still has varied limitations such as flammability, UV sensitivity, and poor oxygen barrier properties. To address these issues, a bio-based compound, hexasubstituted cyclotriphosphazene (HVP), was synthesized by using vanillin and hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene to enhance the overall performance of PLA. The resulting PLA/HVP composites demonstrated improved mechanical strength and UV resistance. Specifically, PLA/3HVP, with a 3 wt% HVP loading, achieved a UL-94 V-0 rating and a high limiting oxygen index of 26.5 %. Cone calorimeter tests revealed that PLA/3HVP possessed a significantly longer ignition time and a lower peak heat release rate compared to pure PLA. These burning testing results indicated the enhanced fire resistance. Additionally, the oxygen transmission rate of PLA/3HVP was reduced by 81.1 % compared to pure PLA. When used as food packaging, the weight loss of mangoes covered with PLA/3HVP film was 2.2 % after 7 days, compared to 2.5 % with pure PLA film, highlighting its potential for food preservation applications.
