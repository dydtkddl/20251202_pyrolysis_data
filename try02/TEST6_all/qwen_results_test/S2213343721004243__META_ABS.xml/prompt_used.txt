You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal, mechanical, rheological, electrical and electromagnetic interference shielding performance of polypropylene/magnetic carbon nanocomposites Novel magnetic bio-nanocomposites were fabricated using polypropylene (PP) as polymer matrix and graphene supported magnetic carbon nanocomposite (MCNC, produced by solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation route integrating low-cost graphene, renewable biomass and iron oxide nanoparticles) serving as filler by incorporating nano-fillers of loading 5%, 10% and 15% with PP using a convenient and time efficient route melt processing. Utilizing waste biomass as integral part of MCNC offers cost effective solution for hybrid nanocomposite synthesis and its application in advance field as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material. The study provides comprehensive analysis for its upgradation in rheological properties that have exclusive impact on its final application. Furthermore, the behaviour for thermal, structural, mechanical, chemical, magnetic, and electrical features using various characterization techniques. Field emission scanning electron micrographs revealed good dispersion of MCNC in PP matrix and formation of network for 15% loading of the filler facilitated 800% higher shielding effectiveness as compared to that of neat PP. It was revealed that functionalization with graphene supported magnetic nanocomposite and polymer matrix have improved the overall conductivity for the composites. Rheological studies indicated the upgradation in viscoelastic properties as solid like behaviour was seen with the increment of filler concentration. X-ray diffractometer demonstrated that MCNC had a substantial impact on the crystallinity of nanocomposite that is validated with modulated differential scanning calorimetry analysis.
