Thermal, mechanical, rheological, electrical and electromagnetic interference shielding performance of polypropylene/magnetic carbon nanocomposites Novel magnetic bio-nanocomposites were fabricated using polypropylene (PP) as polymer matrix and graphene supported magnetic carbon nanocomposite (MCNC, produced by solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation route integrating low-cost graphene, renewable biomass and iron oxide nanoparticles) serving as filler by incorporating nano-fillers of loading 5%, 10% and 15% with PP using a convenient and time efficient route melt processing. Utilizing waste biomass as integral part of MCNC offers cost effective solution for hybrid nanocomposite synthesis and its application in advance field as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material. The study provides comprehensive analysis for its upgradation in rheological properties that have exclusive impact on its final application. Furthermore, the behaviour for thermal, structural, mechanical, chemical, magnetic, and electrical features using various characterization techniques. Field emission scanning electron micrographs revealed good dispersion of MCNC in PP matrix and formation of network for 15% loading of the filler facilitated 800% higher shielding effectiveness as compared to that of neat PP. It was revealed that functionalization with graphene supported magnetic nanocomposite and polymer matrix have improved the overall conductivity for the composites. Rheological studies indicated the upgradation in viscoelastic properties as solid like behaviour was seen with the increment of filler concentration. X-ray diffractometer demonstrated that MCNC had a substantial impact on the crystallinity of nanocomposite that is validated with modulated differential scanning calorimetry analysis.
