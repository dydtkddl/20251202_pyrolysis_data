Defects repaired with oxygen-refilling activate the shallow states of carbon nitride for enhanced visible near-infrared photocatalytic activity The efficient utilization of visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) light of the solar spectrum is of great significance for the practical application of photocatalysis. However, developing photocatalysts with vis-NIR activity remains a great challenge. Here, we report a defect repair strategy to improve the vis-NIR photoactivity of recrystallized amorphous carbon nitride (O-ACN) by engineering the shallow electron trap states via oxygen-refilling defect sites. The obtained O-ACN suppresses the defect-induced deep states and non-radiative recombination, forming electron shallow trap states located at the Fermi level that enhance its electronic conductivity and charge transfer to improve vis-NIR photoactivity. The O-ACN produces H2O2 from H2O and O2 with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 5 % at 600 nm and 23 % at 420 nm, respectively. This work illustrates promising singular vis-NIR photocatalysts for solar-driven environmental remediation and clean chemical production.
