Microplastics remediation in aqueous systems: Strategies and technologies In recent years, the ubiquitous detection and accumulation of microplastics (MPs) in the aquatic environment have raised significant concerns on water security and long-term ecological impacts all around the world. Nevertheless, critical reviews on strategic control and effective remediation of MPs in the aqueous phase are still lacking. In this work, we summarise the origins and types of MPs, and then introduce the methodologies for extraction, identification and quantification. More importantly, we for the first time provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the emerging MPs removal and transformation technologies. Except for biodegradation, this review presents new applications of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for MPs degradation and utilisation, including photocatalysis, photoreforming and Fenton-like reactions. Physical or catalytic thermal treatment can transform plastics into value-added nanocarbons or hydrocarbons. These transformation technologies demonstrate great potentials in dealing with MPs. The review will guide researchers to further explore the feasible approaches and develop new strategies for advanced control and remediation of MPs in the future.
