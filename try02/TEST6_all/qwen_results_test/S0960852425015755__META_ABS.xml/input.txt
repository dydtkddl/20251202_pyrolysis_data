Lignin-shelled phosphate for bilateral enhancement of fire resistance and mechanical properties of strandboards Strandboards from wood-processing residues show promise as building materials but exhibit high flammability. While flame retardants enhance fire resistance, they typically reduce mechanical strength. This study synthesized a nitrogen-phosphorus flame retardant with a polyurethane shell using lignin for flame-retardant treatment. The core–shell design simultaneously improved flame retardancy and mechanical properties. By adjusting lignin content, the impact of modified retardant particles on board performance was systematically evaluated. Compared to conventional phosphorus-nitrogen flame retardant treated boards, the modified versions exhibited 23 %, 14 %, and 45 % increases in internal bond strength, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity, respectively. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) not only elucidated the enhancements in bending properties but also provided intuitive, full-field mapping of strain development. Flame retardancy assessments revealed a 53 % higher limited oxygen index with 25 % and 45 % decreases in smoke production and heat release rate, respectively. Char analysis confirmed that the prepared flame retardant promoted the formation of a highly graphitized char layer, which effectively insulated against both oxygen diffusion and heat transfer. The lignin-derived core–shell flame retardant effectively enhances both mechanical and fire resistance properties, promoting high-value utilization.
