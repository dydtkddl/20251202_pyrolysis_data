You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Aromatic fuel oils produced from the pyrolysis-catalysis of polyethylene plastic with metal-impregnated zeolite catalysts Pyrolysis-catalysis of high density polyethylene (HPDE) was carried out in a fixed bed, two stage reactor for the production of upgraded aromatic pyrolysis oils. The catalysts investigated were Y-zeolite impregnated with transition metal promoters with 1 wt% and 5 wt% metal loading of Ni, Fe, Mo, Ga, Ru and Co to determine the influence on aromatic fuel composition. Pyrolysis of the HDPE took place at 600 °C in the first stage of the reactor system and the evolved pyrolysis gases were passed to the second stage catalytic reactor, which had been pre-heated to 600 °C. Loading of metals on the Y-zeolite catalyst led to a higher production of aromatic hydrocarbons in the product oil with greater concentration of single ring aromatic hydrocarbons produced. The single ring aromatic compounds consisted of mainly toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, while the 2-ring hydrocarbons were mainly naphthalene and their alkylated derivatives. There was a reduction in the production of multiple ring aromatic compounds such as, phenanthrene and pyrene. The addition of the promoter metals appeared to have only a small influence on aromatic oil content, but increased the hydrogen yield from the HDPE. However, there was significant carbon deposition on the catalysts in the range 14–22 wt% for the 1% metal-Y-zeolite catalysts and increased to 18–26 wt% for the 5 wt% metal-Y-zeolite catalysts.
