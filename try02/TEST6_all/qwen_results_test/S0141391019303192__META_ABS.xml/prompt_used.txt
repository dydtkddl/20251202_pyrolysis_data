You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization and laser-induced degradation of a medical grade polylactide In this study, we carried out the structural and thermal characterization of a medical-grade poly (lactide) (PLA) by SEC, TGA, DSC, NMR, ICP-MS and Py-GC/MS. Moreover, we investigated the laser-induced degradation occurring when ultrashort laser pulses (ULP) were employed to cut extremely thin polymer films prepared by solvent-casting. ULP polymer cutting technology is an interesting manufacturing process for its advantages in potential medical applications. In fact, heat transmission to the region surrounding the cuts is limited, so that the incisions are precise and the effects on the regions around them are small. In this way, the need for post-processing is reduced and ULP cutting becomes interesting for industrial applications. However, degradation induced by ULP may occur and compromise the properties of the polymer samples. To investigate this possibility, portions of PLA films, ultrashort laser cut (ULC) and uncut, were analysed by SEC, DSC, NMR and FTIR. Furthermore, PLA oligomers were studied by ESI-MS. Both SEC and NMR showed a decrease in the molecular weight. FTIR, ESI-MS and NMR spectra revealed the presence of olefin end groups originated from a β-H transfer mechanism, induced by heat and/or light (Norrish II mechanism). Additionally, the inspection of the ESI mass spectra highlighted the cleavage of ester bonds related to the Norrish I type mechanism, undetected by the other techniques.
