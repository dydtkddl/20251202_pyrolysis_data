You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Closed-loop phosphorus recovery via engineered biochar: Synergistic co-pyrolysis of invasive water hyacinth with industrial red mud The sustainable recovery of phosphate from aqueous systems while simultaneously valorizing industrial and biological wastes remains a critical environmental challenge. Herein, we developed an innovative red mud-modified water hyacinth biochar (RM-BC) for phosphate recovery and subsequent resource utilization. Systematic investigations revealed that the optimized RM-BC exhibited exceptional phosphate adsorption performance, achieving 99.83 % removal efficiency. RM-BC demonstrated rapid uptake kinetics (89.39 % recovery within 120 min) and maintained robust performance (>70 % efficiency) across a wide pH range (3−11). Kinetic and isotherm analyses indicated that the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Freundlich model, suggesting multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. Thermodynamic studies confirmed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process, with enhanced efficiency at higher temperatures. Advanced characterization elucidated the mechanisms, including pore filling, surface precipitation, complexation, and electrostatic interactions. The phosphorus-laden biochar (RM-BC-P) showed excellent environmental compatibility, with heavy metal leaching levels below regulatory limits, qualifying it as a safe soil amendment. Furthermore, RM-BC-P exhibited controlled phosphorus release characteristics, demonstrating dual functionality as both a slow-release fertilizer and heavy metal immobilization agent in contaminated soils. This work provides fundamental insights into waste-derived adsorbent design and presents a sustainable strategy for simultaneous phosphate recovery and waste valorization.
