Optimization strategies toward production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural from hexose: heterogeneous catalysts, solvent system and process The production of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from biomass feedstocks is pivotal for its conversion into valuable fine chemicals and liquid fuel. One promising approach involves efficiently converting abundant and affordable hexoses into HMF using heterogeneous catalytic systems. Heterogeneous catalysis offers substantial advantages in terms of process economics and sustainability. The paper provides a detailed analysis of optimization strategies for heterogeneous catalytic systems in HMF production, focusing on an innovative approach that enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity of solid acid catalysts. Strategies reviewed include metal loading and acid functionalization, which address traditional catalyst limitations such as poor stability and recyclability. The paper also highlights the development of solvent systems, particularly aqueous-organic phase systems. The systems are gaining attention for their ability to effectively suppress side reactions and improve HMF yields. Furthermore, it explores the role of external fields such as microwave and ultrasound in process intensification. The external fields offer energy efficiency and accelerating reaction rates by directing energy to the catalyst or substrate. These strategies collectively advance green chemistry by providing environmentally friendly and economically viable solutions for HMF production. The insights presented in the review are crucial for the future development of catalysts and sustainable industrial biomass conversion. They underscore the importance of the research in addressing 21st-century energy security and climate change challenges.
