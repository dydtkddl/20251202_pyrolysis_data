You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of biomass and biofuels and their progress using digital technologies This review provides a critical, end-to-end synthesis of how digital technologies are reshaping the biomass and biofuel value chain—from feedstock sourcing to end use. We examine the roles of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and plant-scale digital twins in optimizing supply chains, catalysis, and conversion systems. Evidence indicates that AI-driven predictive models can raise biofuel yields by 15–25%, while IoT-enabled, real-time monitoring cuts operational waste and greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 40%. Beyond process efficiency, we show how digital tools enable rigorous life-cycle assessment, support environmental and health risk management, and expand socioeconomic opportunities, including improved market access for smallholders and demand for skilled jobs. Policy dimensions are addressed through digital frameworks for traceability, transparency, and compliance with evolving regulations. A distinctive feature is our focus on fourth-generation biofuels and the synergistic potential of synthetic biology with AI. We conclude with a practical implementation roadmap that integrates technical, organizational, and policy actions; identifies persistent challenges in data quality, interoperability, cybersecurity, skills, and governance; and outlines research priorities in hybrid physics–ML models, open standards, trustworthy MRV, and equitable deployment. The result is a concise reference for researchers, industry, and policymakers seeking to accelerate a sustainable, low-carbon bioeconomy aligned with global climate goals.
