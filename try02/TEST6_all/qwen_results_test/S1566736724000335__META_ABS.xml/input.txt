Opportunities and limitations of metal additive manufacturing of structured catalytic converters Utilising additive manufacturing (AM), reactors with composite structures, featuring locally tuned geometries and controlled porosity, can effectively be employed in chemical reactions. This innovation yields enhancements in flow and transport properties across both axial and transverse dimensions. Integrating structured catalysts with AM offers great potentials, albeit faces notable challenges. A significant challenge is scarce availability of suitable high-temperature materials for AM of catalytic converters. Furthermore, ensuring optimal adhesion and chemical interactions between catalyst systems and printed materials necessitates detailed investigations. This paper examines advantages and challenges associated with AM of structured catalytic converters, employing emission control systems as an illustration.
