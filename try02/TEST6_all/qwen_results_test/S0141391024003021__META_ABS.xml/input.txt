Copper-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework as a green catalyst for the thermal decomposition of nitrocellulose Copper-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (Cu-CD-MOF) prepared via the vapour diffusion method was applied as an environmentally friendly catalyst for the pyrolysis process of nitrocellulose (NC). The structural and thermal properties of Cu-CD-MOF were comprehensively and meticulously characterized. Differential scanning calorimetry results disclosed the good compatibility of Cu-CD-MOF toward NC. The NC/Cu-CD-MOF mixture exhibited a decrease of 21.6 KJ/mol in energy barrier, which was resulted from the catalytic characteristics. The TG-FTIR measurement confirmed the maximum pyrolysis rate temperatures of NC/Cu-CD-MOF mixture was decreased by 0.9 °C than NC. Furthermore, Cu-CD-MOF was able to accelerate the rupture of the –O–NO2 bond and the secondary self-catalytic reaction. The toxic and harmful gas concentrations were also reduced. This work provided a now path to design green catalysts for NC-based materials.
