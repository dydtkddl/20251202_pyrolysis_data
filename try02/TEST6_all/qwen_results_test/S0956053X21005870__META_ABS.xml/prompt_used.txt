You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery, separation and production of fuel, plastic and aluminum from the Tetra PAK waste to hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes The establishment of a method of separation of materials from Tetra Pak waste to obtain products for use as raw material, fuel or other purposes was investigated in this study. First, the feasibility of hydrothermal treatment for the production of a solid fuel (hydrochar) and solid fraction formed by polyethylene and aluminum, called composite was analyzed. The results indicated that hydrothermal treatment performed at 240 °C yield the formation of hydrochar with good properties for its use as fuel and a composite of polyethylene and aluminum. The best conversion and separation of the cardboard and polyethylene/aluminum were obtained using 120 min as operating time. Then, the recovery of the aluminum fraction from the composite by using spent olive oil waste was studied. A partial separation of the composite layers (polyethylene and aluminum) was accomplished with improved aluminum purity for higher operating temperatures. Finally, the operating conditions of the pyrolysis process for the production of a solid (char) and high purity composite (aluminum) were optimized. The characterization results indicated that both char and aluminum resulting from the pyrolysis of the Tetra Pak at 400 °C still have a significant amount of polyethylene while higher purity levels of aluminum can be obtained at temperatures equal of higher than 500 °C.
