Ultrasonic disaggregation of mixed-dimensional palygorskite clay for improving ABS resin properties High-value utilization of abundant mixed-dimensional palygorskite clay (MDPal) of lacustrine sedimentary origin has attracted great attention. However, the dense stacking of rod-like palygorskite and lamellar clay minerals in MDPal seriously restricts the optimal utilization of the mixed-dimensional nanostructure and multiple mineral properties. Therefore, it is worth exploring to improve the dispersion of MDPal via efficient ultrasonication technology, the large-scale ultrasonic batch dispersion technology of MDPal is investigated systematically in this study. The results showed that the highly dispersed mixed-dimensional clay with original morphologies and nanostructure could be continuously produced by sonicating MDPal dispersion for 10 min, and the specific surface area, surface activity and suspendability of MDPal were greatly improved. Furthermore, the treated MDPal was also more conducive to silanization modification for toughening and strengthening of ABS and served as functional nanofiller with mixed-dimensional nanostructure, which effectively improved the mechanical properties with an increase of 22% in the elongation at break and thermal stability of nanocomposites. This study provides an effective reference for the ultrasonic processing and application of natural mixed-dimensional clay and lays a foundation for the high-value utilization of MDPal for improving polymer properties.
