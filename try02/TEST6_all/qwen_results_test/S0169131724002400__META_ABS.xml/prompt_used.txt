You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrasonic disaggregation of mixed-dimensional palygorskite clay for improving ABS resin properties High-value utilization of abundant mixed-dimensional palygorskite clay (MDPal) of lacustrine sedimentary origin has attracted great attention. However, the dense stacking of rod-like palygorskite and lamellar clay minerals in MDPal seriously restricts the optimal utilization of the mixed-dimensional nanostructure and multiple mineral properties. Therefore, it is worth exploring to improve the dispersion of MDPal via efficient ultrasonication technology, the large-scale ultrasonic batch dispersion technology of MDPal is investigated systematically in this study. The results showed that the highly dispersed mixed-dimensional clay with original morphologies and nanostructure could be continuously produced by sonicating MDPal dispersion for 10 min, and the specific surface area, surface activity and suspendability of MDPal were greatly improved. Furthermore, the treated MDPal was also more conducive to silanization modification for toughening and strengthening of ABS and served as functional nanofiller with mixed-dimensional nanostructure, which effectively improved the mechanical properties with an increase of 22% in the elongation at break and thermal stability of nanocomposites. This study provides an effective reference for the ultrasonic processing and application of natural mixed-dimensional clay and lays a foundation for the high-value utilization of MDPal for improving polymer properties.
