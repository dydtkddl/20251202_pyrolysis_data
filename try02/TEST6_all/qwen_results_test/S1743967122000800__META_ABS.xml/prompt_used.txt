You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of low-rank coal and waste polyethylene with or without additives using rapid infrared heating A newly infrared-heated reactor with a high heating rate (20 °C/s) was applied to explore the co-pyrolysis interactions between low-rank coal and waste polyethylene (PE), and further observe the effect of organic plastic additives (OPAs) in PE on co-pyrolysis interactions. PEs pyrolysis results revealed that white PE hose without additives (WPE) and black PE threading pipe with additives (BPE) exhibit significantly different product distribution. Co-pyrolysis results indicated that the addition of WPE in coal is conducive to forming tar, with a maximum tar yield increment of 6.23 wt% observed at coal/WPE (7:3). However, adding BPE in coal has a slight impact on the tar yield but significantly enhances the light fractions in tar, with a maximum light tar content increment of 6.00% at coal/BPE (9:1), revealing the interactions between OPAs volatiles and coal volatiles. The volatile-volatile interactions promote the cracking of waste PE to form short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and inhibit coal pyrolysis to generate aromatics and phenols. Furthermore, the chars from co-pyrolysis have a lower H/C ratio and higher C-centered radical concentration than coal char, further demonstrating that hydrogen has been transferred to the liquid products, which can provide an effective complement for understanding the co-pyrolysis interactions.
