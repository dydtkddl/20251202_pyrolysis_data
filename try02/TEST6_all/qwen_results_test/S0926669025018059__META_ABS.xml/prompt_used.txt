You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multimodal optimization of synergistic aluminum/nickel catalytic pyrolysis for enhanced hydrogen production from tobacco straw The urgent challenge of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution caused by fossil fuels necessitates the development of sustainable alternatives such as biomass pyrolysis. To enhance the green H2 production, a fluidized bed is developed for tobacco straw pyrolysis, and combined experimental and numerical investigations are conducted to utilize high-cellulose agricultural waste and assess pyrolysis performance. Effects of catalyst composition (Al/Ni ratio) and operating conditions on H2 production are analyzed. The results indicate that the Al/Ni bimetallic catalyst significantly outperforms monometallic systems, boosting H2 yield by 5 % to 30.84 vol% at 973 K via intermetallic electron transfer. Additionally, particle size significantly affects pyrolysis, balancing reaction kinetics and mass transfer efficiency. Furthermore, multimodal characterizations from TGA, FT-IR, XPS, XRD and Raman confirm that the Al/Ni successful doping in the pyrolyzed carbon matrix, structurally modulating the carbon skeleton to promote H2 production. The optimum conditions (T p=973 K, m i=6 L/min, m b=1.5 L/min, 70 mesh particles) are identified via response surface analysis and experimentally validated. This research provides actionable process settings to enhance H2 production efficiency from tobacco straw pyrolysis and a theoretical basis for bimetallic co-pyrolysis modulation.
