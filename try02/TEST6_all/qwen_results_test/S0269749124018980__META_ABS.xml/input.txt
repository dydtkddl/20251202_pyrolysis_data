Mass concentrations, compositions and burial fluxes of nano- and micro-plastics in a multi-species saltmarsh Plastic pollution poses a serious threat to marine ecosystems; yet quantifying the mass concentrations of nano- and microplastics (NMPs) in saltmarsh sediments at the ocean-land interface remains a critical research gap. Here, the study employed reliable and efficient analytical techniques, namely pressurized liquid extraction and the double-shot model of thermal desorption/pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to quantify six different types of NMPs in the sediment of a multi-species saltmarsh, providing the first comprehensive assessment of NMP mass concentration and burial in this saltmarsh environment. The results demonstrate that polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene dominated the NMP composition in sediments, constituting 72.6%, 17.3%, and 4.5% of the total NMPs, respectively. The measured NMPs represent an anthropogenic intrusion, constituting 0.10%–0.23% of the carbon storage in the saltmarsh. By examining the vertical concentration profiles, this study unveiled the influence of saltmarsh vegetation on NMP deposition in sediments, establishing a connection with local sedimentation patterns and the historical zonation of plant species such as Scirpus mariqueter, Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora. These findings underscore the crucial role of saltmarsh vegetation in facilitating NMP settling and retention, highlighting the necessity of considering vegetation dynamics in examining the emerging NMP pollution in coastal wetlands.
