You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An environmentally friendly electrochemical reactor for the degradation of organic pollutants in the total absence of a liquid electrolyte: A case study using diclofenac as a model pollutant In order to fabricate an environmentally friendly electrochemical reactor for the degradation of organic pollutants in the total absence of a liquid electrolyte, fluid-permeable anodes (FPAs) composed of mixed oxide-covered mesh electrodes (MOMEs) containing cobalt and nickel, denoted as MOME-Ni(x)Co(1−x)O y where x =0.9, 0.8 and 0.3, were prepared by thermal decomposition using the slow cooling rate method on a stainless-steel fine-mesh support. The electrochemical degradation of diclofenac (model pollutant) in electrolyte-free water was carried out in batch mode using a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrochemical reactor. For the different MOME compositions, their properties were investigated as a function of the initial drug concentration (IDC) and the electric current density (j). The effects of IDC and j on the degradation of diclofenac were quite similar according to analyses performed using UV–vis and HPLC techniques, wherein it was verified for the different MOMEs that the degradation rate of diclofenac increased with increasing j and IDC. The electrode composition (Ni percentage) exerted only a minor influence on the degradation of diclofenac. On the other hand, a strong influence of j and IDC on the degradation was verified. It was also verified that an increase in IDC resulted in higher values of total current efficiency (TCE) measured for the combustion reaction. Taking into account that the lowest values of the electrical energy per order (E EO) were obtained for MOME-Ni(0.3)Co(0.7)O y , it was concluded that the best overall performance for the electrochemical degradation of diclofenac in electrolyte-free water was achieved using this electrode composition.
