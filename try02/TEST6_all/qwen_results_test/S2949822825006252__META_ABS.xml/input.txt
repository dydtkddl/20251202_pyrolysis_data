Upcycling secondary nickel from spent nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries as a nanocatalyst on sulfated natural zeolite for converting LDPE plastic waste into jet-fuel hydrocarbons This research investigates the potential of using the secondary nickel metals as the nanocatalyst in sulfated natural zeolite (Ni/SNZ) derived from spent Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC) batteries for the catalytic conversion of Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) plastic waste into jet-fuel range hydrocarbon. The synthesis process involved extracting Ni metals from spent NMC cathode using phosphoric acid-oxalic acid and purifying natural zeolite, followed by sulfation and nickel loading to enhance catalytic properties. The catalytic performance was evaluated in a semibatch microreactor, where the LDPE feedstock was subjected to pyrolysis in the presence of the Ni/SNZ nanocatalyst. The results demonstrated a significant conversion of LDPE to jet-fuel range hydrocarbons, with a substantial fraction falling within the jet-fuel range (C6-C18) with liquid conversion and selectivity up to 50.02 % and 45.90 %. Additionally, the nanocatalyst exhibited high stability. This study highlights the dual benefit of addressing plastic waste management and recycling valuable metals from spent batteries, presenting an innovative approach towards sustainable development and circular economy.
