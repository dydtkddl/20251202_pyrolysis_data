You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enabling robust and energy-efficient laser powder bed fusion of Cu alloys via Mo nanoparticle decoration Laser Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB) of copper and low-alloyed copper alloys remains challenging due to their low infrared absorptivity and high thermal conductivity. This study introduces a multi-faceted strategy integrating computational thermodynamics-guided alloy design, Mo nanoparticle surface decoration, and thermal process optimization to enable robust and energy-efficient PBF-LB processing of reflective Cu-based alloys. Surface decoration with 0.44 wt% Mo nanoparticles enhances laser energy absorption, enabling a 40–45 % reduction in the required laser volumetric energy density from 167 to 188–100–118 J/mm3 to achieve > 99.1 % part density. Additionally, Mo addition improves the alloy’s resistance to precipitate coarsening while maintaining low solid solubility in Cu, thereby preserving electrical conductivity. In CuCrZr alloys, baseplate preheating to 300 °C promotes densification and in-situ precipitation of Cr and CuxZry phases during PBF-LB, enhancing both strength and conductivity. In contrast, Mo addition suppresses in-situ precipitation due to its sluggish diffusion in Cu and preferential partitioning into Cr and CuxZry phases. After direct age-hardening (450 °C, 9 h), the CuCrZrMo alloy exhibits a fine dispersion of Mo-doped nanoprecipitates, achieving a yield strength of 598 ± 7 MPa (vs. 576 ± 7 MPa for CuCrZr) while retaining high electrical conductivity (67–68 % IACS). This work highlights a synergistic alloy and process design strategy to address key PBF-LB challenges in Cu alloys, enabling their application in high-performance components requiring combined high mechanical strength and electrical conductivity.
