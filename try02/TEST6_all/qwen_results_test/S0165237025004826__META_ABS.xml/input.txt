Ni-red mud catalyzed co-gasification of tobacco waste and plastic mulching film in CO2 atmosphere for syngas production The synergistic conversion of CO2 and solid waste into energy is becoming increasingly important for mitigating environmental impacts and advancing the circular economy.This study investigated the co-gasification of tobacco waste (TW) and plastic mulching film (PMF) using a Ni-modified red mud catalyst (Ni-CRM600) in a CO2 atmosphere to produce syngas. The pyrolysis behavior of the raw material was investigated under N2 and CO2 atmospheres, revealing a significant increase in mass loss under CO2 conditions. Subsequently, the Ni-CRM600 catalyst system was used to optimize the effects of CO2 concentration, reaction temperature, and the ratio of TW to PMF on syngas yield. Under optimized reaction conditions, a maximum synthesis gas yield of 1195 mL/g was achieved (H2: 623 mL/g, CO: 572 mL/g). Furthermore, experimental results indicate that both catalyst stability and gas yield decrease with increasing CO2 concentration. CO2 not only serves as the gasification medium for the reaction but also influences product distribution and catalyst stability through the Boudouard reaction, while enhancing the catalyst's resistance to carbon deposition. This study provides important insights into utilizing CO2 auxiliary gasification technology to convert PMF and TW into syngas.
