You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ni-red mud catalyzed co-gasification of tobacco waste and plastic mulching film in CO2 atmosphere for syngas production The synergistic conversion of CO2 and solid waste into energy is becoming increasingly important for mitigating environmental impacts and advancing the circular economy.This study investigated the co-gasification of tobacco waste (TW) and plastic mulching film (PMF) using a Ni-modified red mud catalyst (Ni-CRM600) in a CO2 atmosphere to produce syngas. The pyrolysis behavior of the raw material was investigated under N2 and CO2 atmospheres, revealing a significant increase in mass loss under CO2 conditions. Subsequently, the Ni-CRM600 catalyst system was used to optimize the effects of CO2 concentration, reaction temperature, and the ratio of TW to PMF on syngas yield. Under optimized reaction conditions, a maximum synthesis gas yield of 1195 mL/g was achieved (H2: 623 mL/g, CO: 572 mL/g). Furthermore, experimental results indicate that both catalyst stability and gas yield decrease with increasing CO2 concentration. CO2 not only serves as the gasification medium for the reaction but also influences product distribution and catalyst stability through the Boudouard reaction, while enhancing the catalyst's resistance to carbon deposition. This study provides important insights into utilizing CO2 auxiliary gasification technology to convert PMF and TW into syngas.
