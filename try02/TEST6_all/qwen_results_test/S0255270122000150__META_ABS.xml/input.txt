Fabrication of novel microreactors in-house and their performance analysis via continuous production of biodiesel Microreactors enhance biodiesel yields due to their more efficient mixing mechanisms and faster mass transfer rates than conventional batch processes. In this investigation, microreactors with different designs and geometries (four T-shaped with different lengths, one Y-shaped, and one Tesla-shaped) have been successfully fabricated at Fab Lab Bahrain using a high-resolution CO2 laser cutting machine. Then, the performances of these microreactors for the continuous production of biodiesel were tested and compared. The transesterification of the 9:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil was operated at a temperature of 60°C, with a 1.0 wt% NaOH catalyst. The performance of each microreactor for biodiesel synthesis was experimentally studied. The highest biodiesel yield was found to be 97.9%, with the Tesla-shaped microreactor at a residence time of only 4.85s, while the T- and Y- shaped microreactors give the highest percentage yield of 93.3% and 94.3%, respectively, with a residence time of 3.28s each. Online monitoring of the microchannel using optical imaging showed a mixing percentage of 97.6%, 97.87%, and 99.52% with T-, Y-, and Tesla- shaped microreactors, respectively, which consolidates the mixing effect's on developing the percentage yield of biodiesel.
