You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of novel microreactors in-house and their performance analysis via continuous production of biodiesel Microreactors enhance biodiesel yields due to their more efficient mixing mechanisms and faster mass transfer rates than conventional batch processes. In this investigation, microreactors with different designs and geometries (four T-shaped with different lengths, one Y-shaped, and one Tesla-shaped) have been successfully fabricated at Fab Lab Bahrain using a high-resolution CO2 laser cutting machine. Then, the performances of these microreactors for the continuous production of biodiesel were tested and compared. The transesterification of the 9:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil was operated at a temperature of 60°C, with a 1.0 wt% NaOH catalyst. The performance of each microreactor for biodiesel synthesis was experimentally studied. The highest biodiesel yield was found to be 97.9%, with the Tesla-shaped microreactor at a residence time of only 4.85s, while the T- and Y- shaped microreactors give the highest percentage yield of 93.3% and 94.3%, respectively, with a residence time of 3.28s each. Online monitoring of the microchannel using optical imaging showed a mixing percentage of 97.6%, 97.87%, and 99.52% with T-, Y-, and Tesla- shaped microreactors, respectively, which consolidates the mixing effect's on developing the percentage yield of biodiesel.
