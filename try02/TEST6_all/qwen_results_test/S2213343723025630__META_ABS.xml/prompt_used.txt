You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Eco-synthesis, characterization and application of waste plastics pyrolysis char in arsenic removal from contaminated water: An integrated circular framework with parametric response surface methodology optimization-cum-artificial neural network model Eco-synthesis of a novel, cost-effective activated adsorbent from waste low-density polyethylene plastic pyrolysis char at 550 °C and its arsenic adsorption potential in simulated aqueous media has been investigated. Characterization reveals good surface chemistry and evolved morphology of activated char adsorbent with carbon structures at high pyrolysis temperature, thereby facilitating high arsenic adsorption uptake. A unique integrated framework of kinetic equilibrium investigation, parametric optimization applying response surface methodology (RSM) with responsive arsenic adsorption efficiency and artificial neural network (ANN) model for response validation has been presented. There is reasonably good fitting of experimental equilibrium figures into the Langmuir isotherm model ( R 2 = 0.9920). The effects of adsorbent pyrochar dose, arsenic concentration, contact time and pH on the arsenic removal capacity have been depicted via conjugate RSM graphs. The ANN regression curves showed R2 value of 0.99436, validating the model with ANN architecture as 4–8-1. Iron oxide complexation with arsenic on adsorbent surface is reported to play a dominant role in the proposed adsorption mechanism. The proposed hybridized model can be applied to examine the adsorptive removal of various contaminants in water. Techno-economic analysis of scaled-up community arsenic filter showed high removal efficiency (> 90%) of arsenic by activated plastic pyro-char adsorbent from contaminated water at an affordable cost of 0.67 $/m3 of treated water. The activated plastic waste pyro-char with an adsorption capacity of 7.21 mg/g is, therefore, environmentally sustainable in plastic waste management in the post-pandemic era for a ‘waste to wealth’ circular economy with perspective arsenic removal from contaminated water.
