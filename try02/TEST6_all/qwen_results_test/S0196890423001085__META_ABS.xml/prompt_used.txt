You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Techno-economic and thermodynamic analysis of solid oxide fuel cell combined heat and power integrated with biomass gasification and solar assisted carbon capture and energy utilization system A new system involving biomass gasification (BioG) with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) in combined heat and power (CHP) manner is evaluated. The aim of this system is to efficiently utilize biomass, while solar-assisted solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) methanation exploits CO2 from the system exhaust. CO2 and H2O are co-electrolyzed to form syngas, followed by four step methanation to produce synthetic natural gas. The energy system is thoroughly assessed using energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental assessments. The BioG-SOFC-CHP overall energy and exergy efficiencies reach up to 59 % and 44.7 %, respectively. Additionally, the SOEC-methanation subsystem achieved overall energy and exergy efficiencies of 78.5 % and 73.8 %, respectively. BioG showed the largest exergy destruction of 78.34 kW compared to 12.3 kW for SOFC. In SOEC-methanation subsystem, heater 2 has the largest exergy destruction of 98.93 kW. The economic analysis showed that the methane selling price of 18 $/GJ and the electricity tariff of 0.13 $/kW, which are nearly identical to the market price, resulting in a payback period of 10 years. Exergoeconomic analysis showed cost rate of SOFC power generation and methane production of 0.05225$/kWh and 29.5$/GJ, respectively. The BioG-SOFC-CHP provided low CO2 emission of about 0.13–0.166 t/GJ, which indicates its low environmental impact.
