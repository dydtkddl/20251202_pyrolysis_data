You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic hydrocracking of heavy wax from pyrolysis of plastic wastes using Pd/Hβ for naphtha-ranged hydrocarbon production The catalytic hydrocracking of heavy wax derived from the pyrolysis of waste plastics was conducted for valuable naphtha production on the bifunctional catalyst. As the result of the support screening to prepare the bifunctional catalyst, the acidic Hβ was chosen, which exhibited the reasonable wax conversion (64%) and the highest saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon content (98%) in naphtha fraction at 380 ̊C. Then, Pd was impregnated on the Hβ as an active metal, and ≥ 0.6% Pd could dramatically improve the cracking and hydrogenation activities of the Hβ even at 360 ̊C from 47.9% to >97.5% conversion. Also, the liquid product mainly composed of saturated hydrocarbons (88% paraffins), which is quite suitable for naphtha. Especially, Pd[0.6]/Hβ, having 0.012 of the metal/acids ratio, exhibited the highest hydrocracking activity (99.2% conversion and 97.8% naphtha fraction in liquid), and that of >0.012 led catalyst’s isomerization activity increased.
