You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Additive manufacturing of heat exchangers in aerospace applications: a review The current review is mainly focused on exploring Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods suitable for the fabrication of complex-shaped compact Heat Exchangers (HXs) used in the aerospace industry. The introduction of Additive Manufacturing technologies, thanks to the freedom of design and the ability to produce topologically optimised complex parts, aims at the production of high-efficiency Heat Exchangers. These new Heat Exchangers are characterised by very thin features and a substantial reduction in the weight of the parts compared to the products conventionally manufactured, maintaining a leak-proof structure and excellent mechanical properties. The current L-PBF systems along with software packages are not yet fully ready for the creation of thin leak-proof features needed for highly efficient complex-shaped compact Heat Exchangers and most of the studies in the literature are in the initial development stages. This literature review is covering the current advanced manufacturing technologies which can be employed to manufacture the new generation of compact Heat Exchangers, with particular reference to the Laser-Powder Bed Fusion. The advantages and the current challenges of the Additive Manufacturing processes are described. Furthermore, the state-of-art of topological optimisation and CFD analysis as design tools to support the production of additively manufactured were critically analysed. Finally, new criteria of how to down-select compact Heat Exchanger materials for Additive Manufacturing in the aerospace industrial sector are presented, with particular attention to Aluminium alloys.
