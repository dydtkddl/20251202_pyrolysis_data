You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A century of evolution: Progress and milestones in fischer-tropsch synthesis Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) has experienced significant advancements over the past century, establishing itself as a crucial technology for converting syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) into valuable hydrocarbons, including synthetic fuels and chemicals. This review thoroughly examines the evolution of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, from its early beginnings to the latest innovations. Key advancements in catalyst design are explored, focusing on cobalt and iron-based systems, the role of bifunctional catalysts, and the influence of promoters and catalyst supports. Recent advances have driven significant interest in the design of bifunctional catalyst. These catalysts integrate syngas conversion with hydrocracking functionalities, enabling the direct and selective production of middle distillate fuels. The review critically examines the challenges of catalyst deactivation and the strategies to enhance activity, selectivity, and stability. Various reactor designs are discussed, from fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors to modern microchannel reactors and process intensification techniques. The transition towards sustainable feedstocks, including biomass and CO2, is also analyzed, with a particular emphasis on the potential of FTS in producing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from CO2. The review shows that while considerable progress has been achieved, significant breakthroughs have been relatively limited in recent decades. Ultimately, the review offers a forward-looking perspective, identifying key areas for future research and development that will shape the next century of progress for this vital technology.
