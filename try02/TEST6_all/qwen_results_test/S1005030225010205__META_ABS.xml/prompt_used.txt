You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tick-inspired, self-healing, and strongly-adhesive coatings with biodegradability and phosphorus-free fire retardancy Although widely applied in diverse industries, conventional fire-retardant coatings generally suffer from poor adhesion and fire protection. These coatings are typically phosphorus-containing and non-recyclable, making their waste prone to causing environmental issues, e.g., bioaccumulation and (micro)plastic pollution. Inspired by the multi-non-covalent adhesion mechanism of ticks, we designed a strongly adhesive and self-healing coating (DCNC/40PEN) with superior fire protection by incorporating hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and cation-π interactions. Incorporating these interactions into a dynamic covalent network further imparts closed-loop recyclability and biodegradability to the coating. DCNC/40PEN can adhere to diverse substrates and self-heal at room temperature due to the non-covalent and covalent interactions within its structure. DCNC/40PEN features closed-loop recyclability and biodegradation because of its dynamic covalent network. Owing to the catalytic and crosslinking carbonization of sulfonate and Schiff base groups, phosphorus-free DCNC/40PEN delivers exceptional fire protection for various materials, e.g., wood, polymer foams, and steel. At a coating thickness of 100 μm, DCNC/40PEN significantly increased the limiting oxygen index and vertical combustion (UL-94) rating of wood to 35.0 % and V-0. The multifunctionality and sustainability of DCNC/40PEN enable it to outperform commercial and reported fire-retardant coatings and adhesives. This work presents an innovative design strategy for the next generation of sustainable, versatile fire-retardant coatings, accelerating “green” development.
