Harnessing cutin and suberin from plant waste: Challenges and advancements in extraction methods Cutin and suberin are essential components of protective barriers in plants, offering promising applications in bioplastics, medical devices, and sustainable construction materials. Despite their potential, cutin and suberin are treated as waste, with millions of tons discarded globally. The primary challenge in their broader utilization lies in the inefficiency of current extraction methods. Conventional chemical processes are energy-intensive, generate secondary pollution, and yield low results. Greener approaches require milder conditions, are less toxic, and can achieve higher yields—for instance, High-Pressure Homogenization reduces sodium hydroxide use by 33 % while improving cutin recovery by 42 %, and Supercritical Fluid Extraction can reach up to 66.6 % suberin purity with minimal environmental impact. However, these methods are costly, inconsistent, and impractical for large-scale operations. Enzyme-assisted treatments using microbial cutinase and suberinase provide targeted cleavage of ester bonds under mild conditions, preserving polymer structure and enhancing selectivity, but further research is essential to establish them as sustainable solutions. An alternative approach is to integrate the greener approaches with enzyme-assisted treatments, which can improve yield and specificity in an eco-friendly manner. This review critically examines conventional, greener, and enzyme-assisted extraction methods, highlighting recent advancements while also discussing the challenges and limitations associated with each approach.
