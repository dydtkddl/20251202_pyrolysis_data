Dynamic structure transformation of char precursors during co-pyrolysis of coal and HDPE by using ReaxFF MD simulation and experiments Understanding the effects of co-pyrolysis synergies between low-rank coal and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) on the carbon structure evolution in char and the relationship between char structure and chemical bonds evolution is very needed. A combination of ReaxFF MD and experimental approaches provides an opportunity for fully understanding the dynamic profiles of char structures and coking trends during co-pyrolysis process of coal and HDPE. In this work, consistent conclusions were obtained from fixed-bed experiments and ReaxFF MD simulations in product distribution during both individual coal pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis at different temperatures. The ReaxFF MD simulation results reveal that adding HDPE partially inhibited the coking process of coal char. The RDF results indicated higher order degree and aromaticity exist in coal/HDPE(7:3)-Char when compared to those in coal-Char, which agrees well with the findings from XRD and FTIR approaches. By analyzing the evolution of C=C, C=O, C-O, C(sp 2)-C(sp 3), C(sp 3)-C(sp 3) and C(sp 2)-H bonds in C40+ fragments during secondary simulations of co-pyrolytic char, it was observed that the structural order and aromaticity of co-pyrolytic char increase with temperature, and the oxygen-containing bonds are the initial recombination sites for char formation. These findings provide rich theoretical information to complement the understanding of char structure in co-fed systems and the interaction between coal and HDPE blend.
