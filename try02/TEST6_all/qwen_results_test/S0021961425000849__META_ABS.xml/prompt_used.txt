You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric kinetic study of catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of PET bottles and micro carbon rod formation This study examined the thermogravimetric pyrolysis behaviour of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles using catalysts like ferrocene (F), red mud (RM), a Ni/Cu/Mo multicomponent catalyst on kieselguhr, and ferrocene-red mud mixtures, with or without hydrogen peroxide. Heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min were used. The Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) models determined activation energies (Ea), which were lower with catalysts compared to pure PET (189 kJ/mol). The lowest Ea (53 kJ/mol) was achieved with hydrogen peroxide, resulting in complete pyrolysis and no char. SEM analysis of the resulting char showed micro carbon rod (MCR) formations. The best catalyst can be chosen based on the needs of the final product. For example, if MCR creation is the goal, ferrocene and red mud may be the best choice; if full pyrolysis is the goal, H2O2 may provide the greatest result. The thermodynamic analysis, including ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS, indicated that the enthalpy values for catalyst-containing PETs are lower than those for pure PET. This suggests that the synergistic effect of catalytic pyrolysis likely reduces the energy required to form the activated complex during the thermal decomposition of PET.
