You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of cassia fistula seed and shell co-pyrolysis yield optimization by response surface methodology and compositional analysis The primary objective of this study was to enhance the bio-oil yield from the seed, shell, and blend of Cassia fistula (CF) through the application of response surface methodology (RSM). The study focused on analysing the product composition, qualities and optimizing the process by altering the heating temperature, the heating rate, and CF seed to CF shell blend ratio. The physicochemical characteristics of biomass samples were evaluated through Fourier Transform Infrared, proximate analysis, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, higher heating value, fuel reactivity, thermogravimetric analysis, CHO index, etc. Analysis of variance established that the temperature during co-pyrolysis of the CF seed and shell was the most critical factor in determining the bio-oil yield. The optimal bio-oil yield, gas yield, and char yield were obtained at a heating temperature of 450 °C, a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and a blend ratio of 75%. A statistical model was constructed to examine the parameters identified through analysis of variance as having a substantial impact on the experimental results. This study provides insights into RSM approaches that lead to a more practical approach to process modelling. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the bio-oil was primarily composed of hydrocarbons, followed by ketones and phenolic compounds. The bio-oil analysed exhibited a carbon chain range of C2-C12.
