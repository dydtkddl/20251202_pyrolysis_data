You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of excavated waste from landfill mining: Characterisation of the process products The current transition to a circular economy model laid the foundations for the development of the Enhanced Landfill Mining concept. Hitherto, a few studies have been performed on the thermochemical valorisation of excavated waste, of which a majority concern incineration or gasification. Nonetheless, no previous studies on excavated waste pyrolysis, including the characterisation of the process products, have been identified. Ergo, this study aims at filling this knowledge gap. The pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel formed from excavated waste was performed in a lab-scale reactor in the temperature range of 400–700 °C. The non-condensable products (non-condensables) were analysed using Micro GC, whereas the condensable products (condensables) were characterised using GC/MS. Additionally, the distribution of C, H, N, S, O, and Cl among the process products was analysed. The high content of C2–C3 hydrocarbons was detected in non-condensables, whereas the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was detected among condensable products. However, due to feedstock complex thermal decomposition pattern, no overall tendency, covering the process product properties in relation to the process temperature, can be determined. These fluctuations of composition, therefore, have to be taken into account in the planning of the future utilisation of the excavated waste pyrolysis products. Moreover, two possible risks, connected with the further process products utilisation, were identified – namely, chlorine forming primarily organic compounds and sulphur forming mostly gaseous compounds (H2S).
