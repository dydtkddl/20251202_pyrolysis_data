On the energy modulation of daytime radiative coolers: A review on infrared emissivity dynamic switch against overcooling Passive daytime radiative cooling represents one of the boldest answers to tackle the future cooling needs of the built environment and to mitigate urban heat island effects. Recent developments in the field targeted sub-ambience with several successful examples. On the other side, heating demands may get exacerbated unless effective countermeasures against overcooling are identified, especially in wintertime or heating-dominated climates. This review aims at collecting state-of-the-art technologies and techniques to dynamically control the heat transfer to and from the radiative emitter and ultimately modulate its cooling capacity. Potential solutions are selected from different applicative fields, including spacecraft thermal control, thermal camouflage and electronics. Environmentally-responsive solutions are analyzed in depth given their perfect match with radiative cooling design requirements. Among them, VO2-tuned Fabry-Perot resonators are given particular emphasis, owing to their proven applicability. Active solutions are presented for completeness, but in less detail. Underlying principles, structural composition and experimental/simulated results are detailed and discussed to identify prominent pathways towards technically and economically effective integration in the built environment.
