You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Economic viability assessment of bioenergy production from agroindustrial wastes through fast pyrolysis Spanish mainland crops, including olives, almonds, and pistachios, play a pivotal role in capital circulation and employment generation. This comprehensive study explores the economic feasibility on the utilization of diverse agro-industrial wastes from Spanish harvests as a promising feedstock for bioenergy production through fast pyrolysis. The fast pyrolysis process is simulated using Aspen Plus® software, employing techno-economic parameters such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Payback Period (PBP), break-even, and minimum product sales price to analyze economic viability of the project. Two different scenarios, based on experimental data from previous studies, are compared. The profitability of this proposal is closely linked to the harvest, which serves as a limiting factor. In all scenarios, the project requires two years to recover the initial investment, demonstrating significant profits once production begins. When considering the impact of scaling up, the NPV of Scenario 2 for PS reached €369.55 M€. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the profitability of pyrolysis depends on the bio-oil selling price and the total production volume. Overall, this study confirms the economic viability of producing bioenergy through fast pyrolysis using various biomass residues. It highlights the potential of harnessing bioenergy from Spanish agro-industrial waste, paving the way for sustainable and economically viable solutions, as indicated by the NPV and IRR metrics.
