You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Continuous-reactor, pH-controlled synthesis of multifunctional mesoporous nanocrystalline anatase aggregates Anatase is an important functional nanomaterial in a wide variety of applications. Despite a breadth of research on novel synthesis methods, there is a lack of studies geared towards developing scalable processes for nanoscale anatase crystalline materials. In this study, anatase secondary nanoparticles are produced in a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) through forced hydrolysis of pre-diluted aqueous TiCl4 solution by controlling pH. The steady-state supersaturation regime of the CSTR process is shown to be inducive to the formation of phase-pure nanocrystalline anatase aggregates in the order of ∼500–1000nm possessing a very high surface area ∼200–250m2/g. The aggregates made of ∼6nm individual primary nanocrystallites are mesoporous – a highly desirable property in building photocatalytic and thin film electrode (Li-ion and solar) devices with enhanced interfacial functionalities. The new process was tested at a range of conditions, 70–90°C, 0.1–0.5M TiCl4, pH 2–5, and 30–60min. pH control was vital in stabilizing the metastable anatase nanocrystallites and promoting their aggregation that facilitates their handling and application. The process achieves >98% steady-state conversion of TiCl4(aq) to nanoanatase without the use of toxic organic chemicals constituting a cost-effective and green alternative to commonly used sol–gel or hydrothermal technologies.
