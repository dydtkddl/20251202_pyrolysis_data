You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction kinetic model of glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate The reaction kinetics of the glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in ethylene glycol (EG) solvent using zinc acetate as a catalyst were investigated. The experimental results show that stirring rate, EG/PET mass ratio, and catalyst dosage all influence the glycolysis rate. The reaction temperature has a decisive effect on the glycolysis rate and the yield of the target product, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). By tracking the distribution of PET repeat units in the products and combining the heterogeneous shrinking core model and homogeneous reaction model, a reaction kinetic model for PET glycolysis was developed. The model accurately predicts the equilibrium product distribution at high temperature and the reaction behavior of large PET particles. The activation energy for the depolymerization of PET to oligomers is 172.71 kJ/mol, making it the rate-determining step of the entire reaction network. The standard reaction enthalpy and entropy change for this step are 22.58 kJ/mol and 16.46 J/mol·K, respectively, indicating that PET glycolysis is an entropy-driven process that requires high temperatures. Increasing the reaction temperature significantly reduces the sensitivity of the reaction rate to PET particle diameter. When conducting PET glycolysis in a series of continuous stirred tank reactors, it is necessary to use both high temperatures and small PET particle sizes to minimize reactor volume and reduce the number of reactors in series.
