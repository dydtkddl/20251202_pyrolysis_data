You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Usability, durability and regeneration of Ag/ZnO coated microreactor for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue The microreactor, which was manufactured for the treatment of aqueous methylene blue (MB) solution, was coated with ZnO photocatalyst with different silver content using the spray pyrolysis method. Dye removal from water as a result of photocatalytic reaction at various residence times under UV-A irradiation was investigated. Here, the effect of morphological structures of ZnO-coated surfaces with and without silver on water treatment was observed. In addition, the effects of hydrogen peroxide at different rates on degradation and catalyst strength were investigated. As a result of experiments, 91% methylene blue degradation was obtained with 1% Ag doped ZnO coated microreactor for a residence time of 2.5 minutes. With the addition of 10% hydrogen peroxide, 96% of methylene blue removal was achieved. It was observed that if the photocatalyst coated reactors were operated for more than 40 hours, the removal efficiency decreased to approximately 62% and remained almost constant and again, returned to their previous performance when regenerated by hydrogen peroxide. In this study, for the first time, Ag/ZnO catalyst was coated on aluminum microreactor by spray pyrolysis method and the usability, durability and regeneration of this reactors were evaluated for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue under UV-A irradiation. The individual effects of UV radiation, H2O2 content and the catalyst on degradation were also investigated.
