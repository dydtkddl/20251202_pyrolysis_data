You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantitative analysis of nanoplastics in environmental and potable waters by pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry Nanoplastics are emerging environmental contaminants, but their presence in environmental and potable water remains largely understudied due to the absence of quantitative analytical methods. In this study, we developed and validated a pretreatment method that combines hydrogen peroxide digestion and Amicon® Stirred Cell ultrafiltration (at 100 kDa, approximately 10 nm) with subsequent detection by pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC/MS). This method allows for the simultaneous identification and quantification of nine selected nanoplastic types, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene (PP), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), polyvinylchloride (PVC), nylon 6, and nylon 66, in environmental and potable water samples based on polymer-specific mass concentration. Limits of quantification ranged from 0.01 to 0.44 µg/L, demonstrating the method’s ability to quantitatively detect nanoplastics in environmental and potable water samples. Most of the selected nanoplastics were detected at concentrations of between 0.04 and 1.17 µg/L, except for PC, which was consistently below the limit of detection (<0.44 µg/L). The prevalent polymer components in the samples were PE (0.10 – 1.17 µg/L), PET (0.06 – 0.91 µg/L), PP (0.04 – 0.79 µg/L), and PS (0.06 – 0.53 µg/L) nanoplastics. The presented analytical method offers an accurate means to identify, quantify, and monitor nanoplastics in complex environmental and potable water samples. It fills gaps in our understanding of nanoplastic pollution levels, providing a valuable methodology and crucial reference data for future studies.
