Onsite environmental analysis by portable mass spectrometry Onsite analysis is essential for the rapid determination of the chemical composition of environmental samples in timely decision-making in environmental monitoring and assessment, and thus has attracted considerable interest in developing portable analytical instruments. Recently, versatile portable mass spectrometry (MS) approaches have been developed as promising analytical tools for onsite analysis of environmental samples, due to their portability, miniaturized design, and excellent analytical performances. This review aims to introduce the techniques and principles of portable MS approaches, emphasizing their features, advantages, and limitations. New sampling methods, sample preparation approaches, and ionization techniques of portable MS for onsite analysis are highlighted. The significant applications of portable MS in onsite analysis of pollutants in air, water, and soil, as well as in emergency environmental monitoring and rapid response to pollution incidents, are reviewed. The prospects for further development and potential applications are also discussed.
