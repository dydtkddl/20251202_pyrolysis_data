You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic analysis and optimization of solar methane dry reforming enhanced by chemical hydrogen separation Thermodynamically limited reactions in membrane reactors for hydrogen generation require a high hydrogen concentration gradient for separation, which imposes an energy requirement that reduces the process energy efficiency. To decrease the required separation energy, chemical hydrogen separation by CO2 is proposed by combining solar-driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) in a hydrogen permeable membrane (HPM) reactor with either reverse water gas shift (RWGS) or methanation. This system has the benefit of using solar renewable energy as well as reducing CO2 emissions. The performances of the proposed membrane reactor configurations for in situ hydrogen consumption are compared to DRM and super-dry reforming of methane (SDRM) in a fixed-bed reactor. The thermodynamic, kinetic, and environmental performances are analyzed and compared from 300 °C to 1000 °C. 2.01 mol CO2 can be reduced to CO per mole CH4 consumed at 1000 °C by coupling DRM with RWGS in a membrane reactor, resulting in a CO2 reduction rate of 1064 kg m−2 yr−1. Alternatively, the minimum energy consumption per mole CO2 converted is 0.79 MJ at 860 °C. This study demonstrates the feasibility of DRM enhanced by chemical hydrogen separation in HPM reactors to convert CO2 into fuels and store solar thermal energy as chemical energy.
