Reduced-order condensed-phase kinetic models for polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene thermochemical recycling Thermochemical recycling of plastic waste (PW) into chemicals and energy vectors requires coupling particle and reactor-scale simulations to accurate condensed phase pyrolysis mechanisms for each constituent. This work proposes a methodology to derive reduced-order condensed-phase kinetic models from validated semi-detailed kinetic mechanisms. Two types of kinetic models are obtained for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS): reduced semi-detailed models and multi-step fully lumped ones. These families offer different compromises between accuracy and computational cost. The former employ 50–100 gas + liquid species and describe both the radical degradation and the detailed carbon distribution of the products. Conversely, the latter involves 5–10 species per polymer tracking only the main petroleum cuts. The kinetic mechanisms are complemented by the definition of thermochemical properties of gas, liquid, and solid-phase species, accounting for phase-transitions through pseudo-chemical reactions. Model validations are performed by comparison with experimental data and the original semi-detailed mechanisms in terms of mass loss, heat fluxes and product distribution profiles. The resulting CHEMKIN-like condensed-phase models are attached as Supplementary Material and as a GitHub repository. Extending the proposed approach to other polymers and coupling it with existing subsets in the CRECK kinetic framework (e.g., biomass, PVC, PET) offers a powerful tool to model thermochemical recycling of PW and biomass/PW mixtures.
