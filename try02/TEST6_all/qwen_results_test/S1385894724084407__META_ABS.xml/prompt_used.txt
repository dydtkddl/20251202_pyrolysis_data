You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reduced-order condensed-phase kinetic models for polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene thermochemical recycling Thermochemical recycling of plastic waste (PW) into chemicals and energy vectors requires coupling particle and reactor-scale simulations to accurate condensed phase pyrolysis mechanisms for each constituent. This work proposes a methodology to derive reduced-order condensed-phase kinetic models from validated semi-detailed kinetic mechanisms. Two types of kinetic models are obtained for polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS): reduced semi-detailed models and multi-step fully lumped ones. These families offer different compromises between accuracy and computational cost. The former employ 50–100 gas + liquid species and describe both the radical degradation and the detailed carbon distribution of the products. Conversely, the latter involves 5–10 species per polymer tracking only the main petroleum cuts. The kinetic mechanisms are complemented by the definition of thermochemical properties of gas, liquid, and solid-phase species, accounting for phase-transitions through pseudo-chemical reactions. Model validations are performed by comparison with experimental data and the original semi-detailed mechanisms in terms of mass loss, heat fluxes and product distribution profiles. The resulting CHEMKIN-like condensed-phase models are attached as Supplementary Material and as a GitHub repository. Extending the proposed approach to other polymers and coupling it with existing subsets in the CRECK kinetic framework (e.g., biomass, PVC, PET) offers a powerful tool to model thermochemical recycling of PW and biomass/PW mixtures.
