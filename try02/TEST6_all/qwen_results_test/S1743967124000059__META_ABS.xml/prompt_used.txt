You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic production of fuels from co-pyrolysis of lignite coal and waste plastic In this study, the co-pyrolysis of Thar lignite coal and waste plastic was investigated, exploring the effects of different parameters such as the coal to waste plastic blending ratio and temperature. The oil obtained from pyrolysis was analyzed for GCV, viscosity, flash point and for chemical composition through GC-MS and FTIR techniques. The results revealed that a blend of 20 % coal and 80 % waste plastic yielded 67 % pyrolysis oil with a GCV of 42 MJ/kg. It was found that adding waste plastics to coal enhanced both the yield and quality of pyrolysis oil. Physical parameters including viscosity and GCV were found to be highly promising and comparable to regular Petro diesel. According to FTIR, presence of significant quantities of aliphatic and aromatic linkages along with carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups were observed. Similarly, GCMS analysis showed the presence of C7 to C20 carbon fractions in pyro-oil of optimum sample. Char residue 21 % was also obtained from the results with carbon contents up to 68 % and less than 1 % sulfur at 80:20 blending ratio of WP and coal. This char residue could be especially useful for use in steam generation or cement industries as clean fuel.
