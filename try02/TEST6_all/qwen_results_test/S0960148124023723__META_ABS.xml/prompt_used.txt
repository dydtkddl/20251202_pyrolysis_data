You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A combined immobilization system for high-solids cellulosic ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation A novel combined immobilization technology was introduced in this work to improve the efficiency and stability of a high-solids biocatalysis system. First, a nano biocatalyst based on commercial cellulase immobilized onto the Fe3O4@SiO2-APTES nanoparticles was synthesized utilizing glutaraldehyde as a chemical crosslinking agent with a final immobilization efficiency of 93.0 %. A decrease in the V max and K m values indicates that the nanoparticle-immobilized cellulase enzyme has an increased binding affinity for the cellulose substrate. Next, a recombinant yeast strain was constructed via yeast cell-surface immobilization with laccase and versatile peroxidase for synergistic lignin-degradation. Functional accessibility was detected by using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Finally, the cooperative biocatalysis of nanoparticle-immobilized cellulase and cell-surface immobilized S. cerevisiae strain for SSF were investigated. Fed-batch operation of the solids at a 30.0 % (DW, w/w) final substrate loading was implemented to manage the instantaneous concentration level of inhibitors and enhance the saccharification of undetoxified biomass. The combined immobilization produced a maximum ethanol titer of 79.5 ± 4.3 g/L and a theoretical ethanol yield of 88.2 % with a low cellulase loading of 10 FPU/g cellulose. This work presented a promising green pathway for achieving efficient cellulosic ethanol production, highlighting potential industrial applications and contributing to manufacturing optimization.
