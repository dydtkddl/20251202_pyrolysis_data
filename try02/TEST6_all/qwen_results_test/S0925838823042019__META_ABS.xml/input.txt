Activation mechanism and strengthening strategies of perovskites activated peroxymonosulfate for organic pollutants degradation: Recent advances and perspective As one of the ideal peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activators, perovskites exhibit high activity and stability. In this work, our research group reviewed the research progress of perovskites as PMS activators. Firstly, the activation mechanism is described, which mainly involves the radical pathways based on the redox of metal ions and the non-radical pathways based on oxygen vacancies. Then, as the focus, the strengthening strategies for perovskites, including morphological engineering, interface engineering and electronic modulation, etc. were summarized. In addition, we also pay attention to some of the latest research in this field, such as tailored properties perovskites and sustainability. Finally, the development direction of perovskites as PMS activators was prospected. This paper is expected to provide a reference for the application of perovskite/PMS system in actual wastewater treatment.
