You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel catalyst featuring highly stable cobalt and manganese nitride nanoclusters dispersed on single atom-anchored carbon nanotubes for hydrolytic release of hydrogen from ammonia borane This study investigated the long-term stability of cobalt (Co) and manganese nitride (Mn4N) nanoclusters in the catalytic hydrolysis of a promising hydrogen (H2) storage material, ammonia borane (H3NBH3; AB), to release H2. It was previously found that Co nanoparticle/Co single-atom catalysts (Co NP/Co SACs) anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNT) exhibited excellent reactivity and stability towards AB hydrolysis and high performance in the H2 evolution reaction in alkaline media. Therefore, the current study synthesised CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800, a CoMn-based catalyst with Co and Mn4N nanocluster active sites, and examined its performance in AB hydrolysis. CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 generated three equivalents of H2 from AB within 5 min, outperforming the catalytic activity of previously reported Co NPs/Co SACs. Moreover, CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 maintained over 90 % of its initial activity after 50 cycles of AB hydrolysis. This exceptional long-term stability is attributable to CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 bearing Co/Mn4N nanoclusters that were strongly adhered onto graphitic layers, thereby preventing metal-atom aggregation and leakage during AB hydrolysis. Thus, CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 displayed a maximum effective H2 generation rate of 8372 mLH2·gCoMn −1·min−1. These results highlight the potential of dispersed bimetallic nanocluster catalysts, such as CoMn4N-based catalysts, for practical and sustainable H2 generation via AB hydrolysis. In addition, the insights gained from this study can inform the design of highly active and stable non-precious metal-based catalysts for energy-related applications.
