A novel catalyst featuring highly stable cobalt and manganese nitride nanoclusters dispersed on single atom-anchored carbon nanotubes for hydrolytic release of hydrogen from ammonia borane This study investigated the long-term stability of cobalt (Co) and manganese nitride (Mn4N) nanoclusters in the catalytic hydrolysis of a promising hydrogen (H2) storage material, ammonia borane (H3NBH3; AB), to release H2. It was previously found that Co nanoparticle/Co single-atom catalysts (Co NP/Co SACs) anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNT) exhibited excellent reactivity and stability towards AB hydrolysis and high performance in the H2 evolution reaction in alkaline media. Therefore, the current study synthesised CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800, a CoMn-based catalyst with Co and Mn4N nanocluster active sites, and examined its performance in AB hydrolysis. CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 generated three equivalents of H2 from AB within 5 min, outperforming the catalytic activity of previously reported Co NPs/Co SACs. Moreover, CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 maintained over 90 % of its initial activity after 50 cycles of AB hydrolysis. This exceptional long-term stability is attributable to CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 bearing Co/Mn4N nanoclusters that were strongly adhered onto graphitic layers, thereby preventing metal-atom aggregation and leakage during AB hydrolysis. Thus, CoMn4N/Co-Mn-N x -CNT-200–800 displayed a maximum effective H2 generation rate of 8372 mLH2·gCoMn −1·min−1. These results highlight the potential of dispersed bimetallic nanocluster catalysts, such as CoMn4N-based catalysts, for practical and sustainable H2 generation via AB hydrolysis. In addition, the insights gained from this study can inform the design of highly active and stable non-precious metal-based catalysts for energy-related applications.
