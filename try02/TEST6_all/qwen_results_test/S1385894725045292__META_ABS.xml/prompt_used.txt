You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metabolic mechanism in biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoate from terephthalic acid by mixed microbial consortium Biosynthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from waste plastics offers a sustainable solution to mitigating plastic pollution for circular economy. Terephthalic acid (TPA), derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolysis, shows potential as a carbon source for PHA production.However, the isolation of microbial strains with high efficiency in converting TPA to PHA remain a significant challenge. In this study, a microbial consortium enriched from sludge during the flask experiments was employed for fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor to facilitate the conversion of TPA to PHA. The fermentation process achieved a maximum PHA concentration of 2.25 g/L with a yield of 0.10 gPHA/gTPA. The dominant microorganisms and TPA transformation pathways were analyzed by genome annotation and intermediate metabolites identification. The consortium exhibited synergistic interactions, with member species producing specific enzymes that sequentially transformed TPA into protocatechuic acid or catechol, ultimately yielding acetyl-CoA as the PHA biosynthesis precursor. This study establishes a sustainable approach for upcycling waste PET plastics into biodegradable polymers. The revealed metabolic mechanisms provide fundamental insights for future improvement of PHA production.
