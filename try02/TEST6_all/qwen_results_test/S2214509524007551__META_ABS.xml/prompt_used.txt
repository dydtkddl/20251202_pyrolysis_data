You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of the properties of bio-asphalt derived from waste cooking oil and low-density polyethylene through the pyrolysis process The aim of this study is to prepare a bio-asphalt for flexible pavement construction using a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor. This method involves incorporating waste cooking oil (WCO) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as feedstock materials. Through this study, an attempt has been made to make use of waste materials and promote the use of environmentally friendly binders in sustainable road construction. The pyrolysis experiment was conducted at different temperatures, varying from 250 °C to 500 °C for different blends of waste cooking oil (WCO) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), i.e., 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1, respectively. At a temperature of 350 °C, the pyrolysis process is more effective for converting various blends of waste cooking oil (WCO) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into bio-asphalt. The maximum bio-asphalt yield of 82 wt% was reported for the 1:3 blend at a temperature of 350 °C. The elemental analysis of an equal mass of waste cooking oil (WCO) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) reported a carbon content of 83.93 wt%, a hydrogen content of 13.29 wt%, and a lower oxygen content of 2.55 wt%. The Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrography (GC-MS) analysis indicated the presence of chemical compounds such as pentadecane, heptadecane, dodecane, cyclopentylpropyl, and hexacosene in the 1:1 blend. The thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric analyses indicate that the 1:1 blend and 1:3 blend can withstand temperatures around 473 °C and 475 °C, respectively. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis showed the presence of alkane, alkene, ester, and other aromatic compounds. Based on this present study, it has been noted that the chemical composition of a 1:1 blend of waste cooking oil (WCO) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE)-based bio-asphalt contains similar chemical compositions as asphalt binder, and it can be used as a modifier for conventional asphalt binder.
