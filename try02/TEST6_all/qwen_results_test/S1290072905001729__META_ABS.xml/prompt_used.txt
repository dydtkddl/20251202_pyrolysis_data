You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A model of the chemical pathways leading to NO x formation during combustion of mixtures of cellulosic and plastic materials A numerical model has been developed to study the NO x formation during the combustion of mixtures of cellulosic and plastic fuels within a fixed bed reactor. The model simplifies the flow to a one dimensional succession of about 1000 perfectly stirred reactors (PSR) and includes a detailed chemical model that computes 113 species involved in 893 reversible reactions, to detailed the reactive path of NO x formation. The calculations use the PSR model included in Chemkin II. The solid phase is not solved but instead the input species are generated from an experimental degradation study of the fuel. Nitrogen oxide (NO) is studied as the primary component of NO x . The model has been validated in past publication by comparison of the results with experimental measurements. The model has then been used to investigate the mechanisms of formation and destruction of the NO during the combustion process of municipal solid waste. Numerical results show that NO forms rapidly from the oxidation of intermediary species such as NCO, HNO and NH that originate from the fuel pyrolysis. NO consumption occurs primarily through reactions with NH i and NCO leading to the formation of N2. The ultimate formation and consumption of NO depends mostly on the primary air flowing through the fuel bed with a minimum being observed when primary air and fuel are present in proportions close to stoechiometric.
