You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ku-band microwave absorbing properties of submicron monodisperse carbon spheres fabricated by hydrothermal synthesis and carbonization Carbon materials have been widely used as the absorber for the stealth of military flight equipment in recent years. This study focuses on preparing submicron monodisperse carbon spheres (SMCS) by hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent carbonization. The influence of carbonization temperature (900 ℃, 1000 ℃, 1100 ℃, and 1200 ℃) on the microstructure, phase, specific surface area, pore size distribution, electrical conductivity, complex permittivity, and microwave-absorbing properties of SMCS in the Ku-band (12.4–18.0 GHz) is investigated. The graphitization degree, electrical conductivity, and complex permittivity of SMCS carbonized at 1100 ℃ are all the highest. The C-1100 in paraffin/composites shows a strong dielectric resonance loss, thus improving microwave-absorbing properties. The effective absorption bandwidth (RL < −10 dB) of C-1100 is 4.9 GHz and the minimum reflection loss (RL min) is −18.71 dB at 14.64 GHz with a matching thickness of 1.3 mm.
