Ku-band microwave absorbing properties of submicron monodisperse carbon spheres fabricated by hydrothermal synthesis and carbonization Carbon materials have been widely used as the absorber for the stealth of military flight equipment in recent years. This study focuses on preparing submicron monodisperse carbon spheres (SMCS) by hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent carbonization. The influence of carbonization temperature (900 ℃, 1000 ℃, 1100 ℃, and 1200 ℃) on the microstructure, phase, specific surface area, pore size distribution, electrical conductivity, complex permittivity, and microwave-absorbing properties of SMCS in the Ku-band (12.4–18.0 GHz) is investigated. The graphitization degree, electrical conductivity, and complex permittivity of SMCS carbonized at 1100 ℃ are all the highest. The C-1100 in paraffin/composites shows a strong dielectric resonance loss, thus improving microwave-absorbing properties. The effective absorption bandwidth (RL < −10 dB) of C-1100 is 4.9 GHz and the minimum reflection loss (RL min) is −18.71 dB at 14.64 GHz with a matching thickness of 1.3 mm.
