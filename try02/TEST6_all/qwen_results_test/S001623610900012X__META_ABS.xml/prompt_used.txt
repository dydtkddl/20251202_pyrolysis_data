You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Wood/plastic copyrolysis in an auger reactor: Chemical and physical analysis of the products Previous studies observed that slow copyrolysis of wood and plastic in enclosed autoclaves produced an upgraded raw bio-oil with increased hydrogen content. We now demonstrate that fast simultaneous pyrolyses of 50:50, w/w, pine wood/waste plastics in a 2kg/h lab scale auger-fed reactor at 1atm, with a short vapor residence time, generates higher heating value upgraded bio-oils. Three plastics: polystyrene (PS), high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were individually copyrolyzed with southern yellow pine wood at 525, 450 and 450°C, respectively, to generate modified bio-oils upon condensation. These liquids exhibited higher carbon and hydrogen contents, significantly lower oxygen contents, higher heats of combustion and lower water contents, acid values and viscosities than pine bio-oil. The formation of cross-over wood/plastic reaction products was negligible in the oils. Simultaneous pyrolysis process design requires using a temperature at which the plastic’s thermal decomposition kinetics produce vapors rapidly enough to prevent vaporized plastic from condensing on wood chars and exiting the reactor.
