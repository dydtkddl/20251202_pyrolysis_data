You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2-Enhanced methanolysis: A sustainable route for the depolymerization of PLA and PET-rich mixed plastic waste Methanolysis of waste poly(lactic acid) (PLA) to produce the non-toxic, biodegradable solvent methyl lactate (MLA) is a promising strategy for waste management. We introduce an efficient, catalyst-free PLA methanolysis approach enhanced by a CO₂ atmosphere, achieving nearly 100 % PLA conversion and a 95.5 % MLA yield. These results represent a significant increase in both conversion and yield compared to reactions conducted without CO₂. Through analytical methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the reaction pathways, showing that CO₂ critically enhances the ester exchange between methanol and PLA chains. This enhancement is attributed to CO₂'s role in stabilizing transition states and promoting ester bond scission by forming additional hydrogen bonds, which facilitates efficient MLA formation. Furthermore, this approach's viability for real-world recycling is demonstrated with commercial PLA products, achieving 53.9 % PLA conversion and 17.0 % MLA yield. When applied to mixed plastic waste containing PLA and PET, the process achieves nearly complete PLA conversion with a 79.4 % MLA yield, while also producing the PET-derived product DMT, which can be isolated along with MLA via simple precipitation and distillation. This research presents a sustainable and highly tolerant solution for the chemical recycling of both pure and mixed PLA waste streams.
