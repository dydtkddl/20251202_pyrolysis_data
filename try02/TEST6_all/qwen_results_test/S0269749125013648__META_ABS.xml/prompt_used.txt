You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of tire and road wear microplastics and phthalates in inhalable PM10 road Dust: Implications for urban air pollution Road dust (RD) is a major contributor to urban environmental pollution. Among its constituents, tire and road wear microplastics (TRWMPs) and phthalates are of increasing concern due to their adverse impacts on human health and ecosystems. This study presents the first integrated analysis of TRWMPs and phthalates in inhalable PM10 RD, collected from industrial and residential areas in Seoul, Korea. Mean TRWMP concentrations were higher in industrial areas (18 mg/g) than in residential areas (16 mg/g), reflecting the influence of truck-bus radial (TBR) vehicles, which have greater tire wear emission factors than passenger car radial (PCR) vehicles. However, elevated styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) to natural rubber ratios in PM10 compared to PM75 RD suggest that PCR vehicles contribute more to the formation of smaller TRWMP particles, as PCR tires generally contain more SBR than TBR tires. Phthalates were detected at notable concentrations (mean: 245 μg/g), with bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) as the dominant species, followed by diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). A moderate positive correlation between DEHP and TRWMPs indicates that traffic-related emissions may be a key source. Additionally, a pronounced DBP–SBR correlation in residential areas suggests PCR vehicles as major DBP contributors. Estimated atmospheric emissions of PM10 TRWMPs (61,194 kg/yr) and phthalates (756 kg/yr) underscore their significance as urban airborne contaminants. This study offers novel insights into the characteristics, spatial distribution, and co-occurrence of TRWMPs and phthalates in PM10 RD, providing a foundation for assessing their environmental and health impacts and for developing targeted mitigation strategies in urban environments.
