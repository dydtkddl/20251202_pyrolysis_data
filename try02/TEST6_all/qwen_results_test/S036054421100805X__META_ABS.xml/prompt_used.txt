You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production from biomass gasification in the oil refining industry – A system analysis In this paper, the global CO2 effect of integrating different biomass gasification concepts to meet an increasing demand of hydrogen in an oil refinery is examined and presented in comparison with a conventional steam reformer. The studied refinery is a hydro skimming refinery with a future hydrogen deficit of 16,000 Nm3/h. Three gasification concepts are considered: Entrained Flow (EF), Circulated Fluidised Bed (CFB) and Double Bed (DB). The system analysis is made with respect to global CO2 emissions and primary energy use. The results show that if biomass is considered as an unlimited resource (i.e. sufficient biomass is considered to be available to substitute for all fossil fuels in society), biomass gasification concepts have a potential to reduce CO2 emissions. The EF case shows the largest reduction potential. However, if biomass is considered as a limited resource (i.e. increased use of biomass at the refinery will lead to increased use of fossil fuel elsewhere in society), all concepts show an increase of CO2 emissions. Here, the CFB gasifier shows lowest increase of CO2 emission. The CO2 effect of the different alternatives shows sensitivity to assumptions regarding alternative biomass user.
