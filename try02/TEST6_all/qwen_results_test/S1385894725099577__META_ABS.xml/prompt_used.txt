You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis behavior of spent bleaching clay and dealkaline lignin: An investigation into TG-FTIR, kinetics, and interaction mechanisms Spent bleaching clay (SBC) and lignin wastes are generated from oil refining and paper industries, respectively. The complementary properties of these two types of waste enable synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis, thereby mitigating limitations characteristic of single-component pyrolysis. In this study, the co-pyrolysis behavior of the two wastes was explored at the microscopic molecular level using simultaneous TG-FTIR technology, coupled with fixed-bed pyrolysis experiments. The co-pyrolysis behavior was systematically investigated at the mass ratio of lignin and SBC (0 %L, 30 %L, 50 %L, 70 %L, and 100 %L) and different reaction temperatures (450, 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C). The results showed that the activation energy required for co-pyrolysis decreased at 50 %L and 70 %L ratios, as determined using FWO and KAS methods. The Ea required for co-pyrolysis decreased at 50 %L and 70 %L ratios. Specifically, the addition of 30 % SBC reduced the activation energy of lignin from 141.67 kJ/mol (KAS) and 146.41 kJ/mol (FWO) to 120.25 kJ/mol (KAS) and 126.04 kJ/mol (FWO), respectively. Furthermore, the 50 %L radio infrared absorbance of CH4 and CO2 was relatively strong due to the enhanced decarboxylation and demethoxylation reactions. Meanwhile, the fixed-bed co-pyrolysis experiment showed that the relative content of non-methoxy phenolics increased from 7.0 % to 10.6 % with bio-oil yield increasing from 27 % to 40 %, after adding 50 % SBC. Additionally, the interaction mechanism was proposed based on the TG-FTIR and fixed-bed pyrolysis experimental results. SBC served as a hydrogen donor to promote the thermal decomposition of lignin and improved the yields of phenol and alkylphenols. This work offers guidance for the synergistic conversion of renewable carbon sources with oily solid wastes.
