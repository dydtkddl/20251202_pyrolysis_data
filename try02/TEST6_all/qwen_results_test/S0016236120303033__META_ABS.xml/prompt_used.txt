You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of volatile reactions on oil production and composition in thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene The volatiles generated from the pyrolysis of waste plastics undergo chemical reactions before being catalyzed to produce the plastic-derived oil. To reveal the relation between the oil properties and the volatile reactions, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene – a main component in waste plastics – were studied at volatilization temperatures of 300–600 °C with a volatilization time of 17.7–53.0 s in a two-stage reactor. The yield and composition of the oil in both thermal and catalytic reactions were investigated. It was found that in thermal pyrolysis, a high volatilization temperature favors the cracking of volatiles, resulting in the decline of carbon chain length and the decrease of the oil yield. Extension of the volatilization time favors the formation of light oil at a volatilization temperature above 400 °C, but produce more long-chain fractions at a volatilization temperature of 300 °C. The carbon number distribution of the oil after catalysis is independent on the conditions for volatile reactions, but the yields of the oil and each fraction after catalysis are higher at a lower volatilization temperature and shorter volatilization time. The long-chain alkenes in the volatiles is responsible for the formation of the coke deposited on catalyst.
