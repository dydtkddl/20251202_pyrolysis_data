You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Natural and waste hydrocarbon precursors for the synthesis of carbon based nanomaterials: Graphene and CNTs Carbon nanomaterials have huge potential in the field of energy and environmental applications. However, a wide range of greener and environment friendly synthesis methods utilizing natural, renewable, cheaper waste materials has to be developed. This will lead to the reduction of green house gases, exploitation of toxic materials and helps in the development of sustainable technologies. In this review, the details progress made in the last ten years concerning the synthesis of new one dimensional (carbon nanotubes CNT, carbon nanofiber) and two dimensional (graphene) carbon based materials using natural precursors and waste materials is summarized. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive scientific progress of synthesis of graphene and carbon nanotubes using natural precursor and waste materials for the future perspective. This paper also concludes with a brief discussion on the impact of natural precursor for the graphene and CNTs for environment, its toxicological effects and its future prospects in this rapidly emerging field. Natural precursors and waste carbon containing products are emerging as a new class of materials that have efficiency to produce graphene and CNTs. The various synthesis processes of graphene, CNTs and carbon dots has been reported using several natural hydrocarbon precursors (turpentine oil, eucalyptus oil, palm oil, neem oil, sunflower oil, castor oil, biodiesel, tea-tree extract, honey, milk, sugar, butter, egg etc.). Also, some research groups have used foods wastes (cookie and chocolate), vegetation wastes (woods, leaf, grass, fruit wastes), animal/bird/insect wastes (bone and cow dung, dog feces, chicken feather) and agro waste (sugarcane bagasse) for the synthesis of graphene and CNTs. Research on natural hydrocarbon precursors and wastage materials has increased in recent years as they promise to produce better and high quality of graphene and CNTs in large quantities. The fascinating aspect of this research area is that it guides the use of natural hydrocarbons to explore the possibilities of improving graphene stability and robustness suitable for different type of applications.
