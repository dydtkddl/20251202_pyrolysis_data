You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical looping combustion performance of High-Entropy dominated oxygen carriers with reserved redox characteristics Adopting the multi-principal element trend, four high entropy oxide (HEO) OCs were developed to fulfill diverse performance demands. These HEO OCs exhibited a distinctive redox pattern characterized by rapid reduction but slower oxidation. The reduction rate of HEO OCs is 1.9 and 2.6 times higher than that of perovskite and hematite OCs, but oxidation rates are only 25% of these reference OCs. Sluggish diffusion effect contributed to exceptional redox stability, exhibiting consistent reactivity, minimal agglomeration, and no phase decomposition across 30 deep redox cycles. Elemental synergies enabled exceptional CH4 conversion, with HEO OCs achieving methane conversion efficiency and CO2 selectivity both exceeding 90%. HEO OCs predominantly formed partially inverted spinel structures. Aluminum incorporation extended benefits beyond anti-sintering, also enhancing solid solution effects and oxygen vacancy formation. Sodium addition was discouraged due to limited solubility and high-temperature instability, with over 60% precepting as secondary phases and undergoing volatilization loss.
