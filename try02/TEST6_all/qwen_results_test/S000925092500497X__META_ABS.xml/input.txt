Chemical looping combustion performance of High-Entropy dominated oxygen carriers with reserved redox characteristics Adopting the multi-principal element trend, four high entropy oxide (HEO) OCs were developed to fulfill diverse performance demands. These HEO OCs exhibited a distinctive redox pattern characterized by rapid reduction but slower oxidation. The reduction rate of HEO OCs is 1.9 and 2.6 times higher than that of perovskite and hematite OCs, but oxidation rates are only 25% of these reference OCs. Sluggish diffusion effect contributed to exceptional redox stability, exhibiting consistent reactivity, minimal agglomeration, and no phase decomposition across 30 deep redox cycles. Elemental synergies enabled exceptional CH4 conversion, with HEO OCs achieving methane conversion efficiency and CO2 selectivity both exceeding 90%. HEO OCs predominantly formed partially inverted spinel structures. Aluminum incorporation extended benefits beyond anti-sintering, also enhancing solid solution effects and oxygen vacancy formation. Sodium addition was discouraged due to limited solubility and high-temperature instability, with over 60% precepting as secondary phases and undergoing volatilization loss.
