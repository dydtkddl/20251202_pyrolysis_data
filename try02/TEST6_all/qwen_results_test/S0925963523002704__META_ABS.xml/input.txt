Mixed matrix membrane comprising functionalized sulfonated activated carbon from tea waste biomass for enhanced hydrophilicity and antifouling properties This study introduces an ultrafiltration membrane with superior water flux, high rejection rates, and low fouling resistance. Tea waste is a low-cost and easily sulfonated material that can be utilized to treat environmental pollutants and natural organic matter, such as humic acid (HA). The membranes were produced by incorporating sulfonated tea waste and activated carbon derived from sulfanilic tea waste (CSATW) into a polyethersulfone (PES) matrix. The chemical structure and morphology of the membranes were analyzed using XRD, ATR-FTIR, FESEM, mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity techniques. The manufactured membranes were evaluated based on their antifouling and permeation properties. The activated carbon from the sulfanilic tea waste had a large surface area and porous architecture, resulting in an MCSATW membrane with a porosity of 70.4 % and a pore radius of 9.4 nm. The CSATW membrane exhibited excellent efficacy in removing HA, with a rejection rate of 94 % attributed to its improved hydrophilicity. This study demonstrates the practical application of waste materials for the production of tea waste bio-composite membranes, which exhibit excellent antifouling properties.
