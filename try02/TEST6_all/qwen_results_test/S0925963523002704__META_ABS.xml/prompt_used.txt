You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mixed matrix membrane comprising functionalized sulfonated activated carbon from tea waste biomass for enhanced hydrophilicity and antifouling properties This study introduces an ultrafiltration membrane with superior water flux, high rejection rates, and low fouling resistance. Tea waste is a low-cost and easily sulfonated material that can be utilized to treat environmental pollutants and natural organic matter, such as humic acid (HA). The membranes were produced by incorporating sulfonated tea waste and activated carbon derived from sulfanilic tea waste (CSATW) into a polyethersulfone (PES) matrix. The chemical structure and morphology of the membranes were analyzed using XRD, ATR-FTIR, FESEM, mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity techniques. The manufactured membranes were evaluated based on their antifouling and permeation properties. The activated carbon from the sulfanilic tea waste had a large surface area and porous architecture, resulting in an MCSATW membrane with a porosity of 70.4 % and a pore radius of 9.4 nm. The CSATW membrane exhibited excellent efficacy in removing HA, with a rejection rate of 94 % attributed to its improved hydrophilicity. This study demonstrates the practical application of waste materials for the production of tea waste bio-composite membranes, which exhibit excellent antifouling properties.
