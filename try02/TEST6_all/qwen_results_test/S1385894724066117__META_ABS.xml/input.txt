A review on catalytic pyrolysis of textile waste to high-value products: Catalytic mechanisms, products application and perspectives The rapid development of the fashion industry has produced a large amount of textile waste. Traditional disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling have caused major environmental problems. Catalytic pyrolysis is a promising technology for converting organic waste into valuable products. In this paper, the current status of research on textile waste catalytic pyrolysis for high-value products is reviewed. The classification and properties of textile materials and their environmental impact are presented. Petrochemical textile fibers have significantly higher carbon content and higher heating value (HHV) compared to other fabrics. The LCA shows that the use of catalytic pyrolysis to recover textile waste can significantly reduce the carbon footprint compared to other recycling methods. The free radical chain reactions involved in the catalytic pyrolysis of textile wastes and the mechanism of action of carbon ions have also been explored. The main causes of catalyst deactivation include coke deposition, metal sintering, catalyst poisoning, etc. In industry, air oxidation is often used to eliminate the coke deposition of catalyst. Moreover, the applications of catalytic pyrolysis products from textile wastes are summarized, mainly in the fields of energy and materials. In addition, it is suggested that developing industrial solid waste with catalytic activity into high activity and cheap catalyst to achieve targeted selection of specific products is the future development trend. This paper is instructive for future research related to catalytic pyrolysis of textile waste for high-value products.
