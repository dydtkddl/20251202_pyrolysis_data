You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on catalytic pyrolysis of textile waste to high-value products: Catalytic mechanisms, products application and perspectives The rapid development of the fashion industry has produced a large amount of textile waste. Traditional disposal methods such as incineration and landfilling have caused major environmental problems. Catalytic pyrolysis is a promising technology for converting organic waste into valuable products. In this paper, the current status of research on textile waste catalytic pyrolysis for high-value products is reviewed. The classification and properties of textile materials and their environmental impact are presented. Petrochemical textile fibers have significantly higher carbon content and higher heating value (HHV) compared to other fabrics. The LCA shows that the use of catalytic pyrolysis to recover textile waste can significantly reduce the carbon footprint compared to other recycling methods. The free radical chain reactions involved in the catalytic pyrolysis of textile wastes and the mechanism of action of carbon ions have also been explored. The main causes of catalyst deactivation include coke deposition, metal sintering, catalyst poisoning, etc. In industry, air oxidation is often used to eliminate the coke deposition of catalyst. Moreover, the applications of catalytic pyrolysis products from textile wastes are summarized, mainly in the fields of energy and materials. In addition, it is suggested that developing industrial solid waste with catalytic activity into high activity and cheap catalyst to achieve targeted selection of specific products is the future development trend. This paper is instructive for future research related to catalytic pyrolysis of textile waste for high-value products.
