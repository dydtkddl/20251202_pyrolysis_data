You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Facile preparation of hierarchical porous MOF-based hollow carbon nanofiber mats using a polymer-blend electrospinning strategy for efficient adsorption of ciprofloxacin A novel hierarchical porous metal-organic framework (MOF)-based hollow carbon nanofiber mat (CNFM) was prepared through a facile electrospinning process followed by carbonization. Two immiscible polymers, polyacrylonitrile/polymethyl methacrylate (PAN/PMMA), and porous zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) particles were selected as components for the electrospinning suspension. The resulting PPZ-CNFM-1–2–2 (PAN:PMMA:ZIF-8 = 1:2:2, mass ratio) exhibited a hollow tubular structure with uniformly distributed dense hollow-spheres on the tube walls. The obtained CNFM possessed a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (S BET) of 1696 m2/g and total pore volume of 2.74 cm3/g, which are comparable to those achieved by traditional physical or chemical activation methods. This MOF-based CNFM demonstrated excellent adsorption performance towards ciprofloxacin (CIP), exhibiting a high static adsorption capacity of approximately 600 mg/g and achieving adsorption equilibrium withing only 1 h. The exceptional adsorption capacity can be attributed to its high S BET and abundant pores that accommodate CIP molecules, while the rapid adsorption rate is facilitated by the presence of hollow-sphere and hollow tubular structures in the carbon nanofibers. Furthermore, the study revealed the significant contributions of pore-filling effect during the adsorption process. Fixed-bed experiments confirmed that this MOF-based hollow CNFM holds great potential for large-scale applications in purifying CIP-contaminated water.
