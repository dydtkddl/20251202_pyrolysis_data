Influence of conical nozzle attachments on horizontal spray dispersion in a fluidized bed In this paper, we investigate numerically the influence of conical nozzle attachments on spray dispersion in a fluidized bed. We utilize an Eulerian approach to simulate flow through the nozzle and subsequent interactions between droplets and solid particles. We use process parameters and material properties relevant to the fluid coking process – bitumen upgrading by thermal cracking – by approximating available experimental data. After considering several attachments with varying expansion angles, we discovered that the best liquid distribution is obtained with the 40° angle attachment because of the jet instabilities facilitated by such a shape of an attachment.
