You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of vaporization models for feed droplet in fluid catalytic cracking risers Vaporization of atomized feedstock is one of the critical processes in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) risers; which is more often ignored in most of the FCC riser modelling studies. In this study, two different vaporization mechanisms of feedstock namely homogeneous mode and heterogeneous mode were studied. Different homogeneous models duly validated for various pure component droplets were applied to predict the vaporization time of the feed droplets typically expected in FCC feed vaporization zone. A new physical model for heterogeneous vaporization considering droplet–particle collision mechanics was also developed in the present study which compared well with the other existing heterogeneous modelling approaches. Comparison of the two vaporization modes indicates that under typical operating conditions of FCC riser, vaporization time of feed droplets predicted by heterogeneous mode is always lower than the homogeneous mode at least by an order of magnitude due to significant increase in heat transfer coefficient which accounts for droplet-particle contact. It is expected that actual vaporization time of feed droplets in an industrial FCC riser should lie in the range predicted by these two vaporization mechanisms which actually set the two limiting modes of vaporization. Obtained results predicted by the models could be used to aid design of the FCC feed vaporization zone.
