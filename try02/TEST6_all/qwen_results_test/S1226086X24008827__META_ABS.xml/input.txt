A review paper: Recent advance catalysts for desulfurization of fuel oil by ODS technology Oxidative desulfurization (ODS) technology is an interesting technology for sulfur removal from crude oil. In this process, C-S bonds within organic sulfide convert to sulfones and sulfoxides in the presence of the catalyst and oxidant. This review presented the recent advances in the various catalysts for the ODS process. Catalysts are divided into two groups including heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. Moreover, metal-based catalysts, metal–organic frameworks catalysts, carbon materials catalysts, and ionic liquids catalysts were discussed. The reaction mechanisms, and the effect of different parameters such as time and operating conditions were deeply discussed as the result of the connection between performances and catalyst characteristics in the ODS process.
