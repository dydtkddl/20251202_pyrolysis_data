Carbon slow release and enhanced denitrification performance and microbial function of sludge-based biochar composite filler in SBR application Stable carbon release and the synergistic microbial efficacy of external carbon source solid fillers are crucial for enhancing nitrogen removal through heterotrophic denitrification. The composite solid carbon source filler (BP) was prepared by ultrasonically combining biochar from municipal sewage sludge pyrolysis with poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). Then, the effect on nitrogen removal was further determined by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The prepared BC, PHBV, BP, and matured biofilms were characterized using SEM, FTIR, and microbial sequencing. The results showed that BP slowly released the carbon source, and the release of SCOD was 26.83 mg/g·L within 12 h. BP also enhanced EPS secretion and elevated the PN/PS ratio to 3.8, promoting robust biofilm formation and stability. Excellent denitrification was also observed in SBR with BP. Moreover, When the initial ammonia nitrogen input was 40 mg/L, the average removal rate and denitrification rate of total nitrogen (TN) in the reaction were 1.58 and 2.15 times that of the control group, respectively. Moreover, Patescibacteria, norank_f__norank_o__Saccharimonadale, and TM7a were notably present in the SBR with BP, underscoring its effective denitrification performance. The study introduced a reliable technique for biological nitrogen removal by using composite carbon source fillers in SBR. Ultrasonic compounding stabilised carbon release (26.83 mg/g·L SCOD at 12 h) and improved PHBV-biochar compatibility, outperforming PHBV-only systems in both rate control and TN removal rate.
