You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon slow release and enhanced denitrification performance and microbial function of sludge-based biochar composite filler in SBR application Stable carbon release and the synergistic microbial efficacy of external carbon source solid fillers are crucial for enhancing nitrogen removal through heterotrophic denitrification. The composite solid carbon source filler (BP) was prepared by ultrasonically combining biochar from municipal sewage sludge pyrolysis with poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). Then, the effect on nitrogen removal was further determined by a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The prepared BC, PHBV, BP, and matured biofilms were characterized using SEM, FTIR, and microbial sequencing. The results showed that BP slowly released the carbon source, and the release of SCOD was 26.83 mg/g·L within 12 h. BP also enhanced EPS secretion and elevated the PN/PS ratio to 3.8, promoting robust biofilm formation and stability. Excellent denitrification was also observed in SBR with BP. Moreover, When the initial ammonia nitrogen input was 40 mg/L, the average removal rate and denitrification rate of total nitrogen (TN) in the reaction were 1.58 and 2.15 times that of the control group, respectively. Moreover, Patescibacteria, norank_f__norank_o__Saccharimonadale, and TM7a were notably present in the SBR with BP, underscoring its effective denitrification performance. The study introduced a reliable technique for biological nitrogen removal by using composite carbon source fillers in SBR. Ultrasonic compounding stabilised carbon release (26.83 mg/g·L SCOD at 12 h) and improved PHBV-biochar compatibility, outperforming PHBV-only systems in both rate control and TN removal rate.
