You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Natural monomers: A mine for functional and sustainable materials – Occurrence, chemical modification and polymerization Owing to the natural abundance, variety of structural features, and highly specific functions, natural monomers render themselves as potential candidates for production of high performance functional polymers. The emerging concept of the biorefinery and development of new biosynthetic routes to synthesize a versatile and broad spectrum of natural monomers and polymers continues to gain momentum. The production of high quality polymers from renewable feedstocks requires innovative chemical modifications and catalytic transformations to achieve higher yields in an efficient manner. A fresh look into monomers available from natural resources such as terpenes, rosin, glycerol, furans, tannins, suberin, their derivatives and miscellaneous monomers may inspire future applications with impactful biobased materials. There are also many areas that require urgent discussion and review pertaining to recent developments in the field; this includes monomer sources that give molecules having special structural features. In particular, cardanol, a naturally occurring low-molecular-weight compound is unique as it contains a phenolic head group and a hydrocarbon chain with different degrees of unsaturation. This molecule possesses functional groups that are amenable for classical chemical modification, which is instrumental in developing a wide range of functional monomers and polymers. A large number of soft and hard materials have been developed from cardanol-based monomers. During the past, a large number of industrial grade materials have been developed from plant-based monomers, including development from microbial and fermentation processes (i.e. lactic acid). This review provides a comprehensive study and survey on recent developments on monomers and polymers derived from urushiol and cardanol based monomers and polymers, vegetable oil-based monomers and polymers, microbially produced monomers and polymers. These all represent emerging fronts giving a vast scope while highlighting important potential material and reagent opportunities.
