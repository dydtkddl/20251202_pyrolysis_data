You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preserving European paintings in Asian environment. The case of Goa Cathedral former altarpiece. How to preserve a set of paintings made with European materials and taken to South Asia in the 16th century? A set of seven paintings belonging to the first altarpiece of Goa Cathedral now remain in its sacristy. Art history states that these paintings, assigned to the painter Garcia Fernandes, were produced in Lisbon circa 1530 and carried to Goa shortly after, Serrão (2011), Reis-Santos (1957). Presently, the conservation state of the paintings indicates urgent treatment. The most damaged paintings show significant loss of the original chromatic layer. This is mostly due to the high temperatures and relative humidity existing in tropical climates, such as Goa, different from the European. The Baltic oak support is covered with ground layers of calcium suphate, which present fissures and great losses due to the shrinkages of the wood support. The high reactivity of the ground materials to water is also a factor leading to specific material deterioration and degradation mechanisms. In comparison with the paintings of the same period produced in Portugal using the same materials, we verify a much higher degradation of the state of conservation. To access the procedures for preservation and restoration of this set of paintings we must take into account the possible degradation mechanisms of the constituent materials brought by specific environmental factors. This paper discusses the degradation problematic of this specific set of paintings taking into account their particular environment, while bringing results on the materials used. Concluding, this study will allow the knowledge on how to preserve and restore one of the most ancient sets of European paintings in India, kept since the 16th century in tropical climate.
