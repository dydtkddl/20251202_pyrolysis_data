You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Machine learning framework to predict product distribution of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis Machine learning methods have become a trend to model distinct chemical processes, as an alternative to complex first-principles models. Given the complexity of biomass pyrolysis mechanisms, these methods offer a promising approach but often face challenges regarding data scarcity and lack of interpretability. This study aims to develop an interpretable framework for modeling biomass pyrolysis using data from fixed-bed lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis experiments. A mass change basis was proposed to construct machine learning models, including artificial neural network (ANN) and symbolic regression (SR) models. Feature importance was assessed using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and compared to Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, with PLS consistently identifying the best features for symbolic regression. Both ANN and SR models showed similar accuracy, achieving coefficient of determination (R 2 ) greater than 0.85 across all phase products in the testing set. Additionally, an uncertainty assessment of SR parameters was conducted to improve model robustness ensuring prediction stability. SR models exhibited superior generalization capacity during extrapolation tests, achieving R 2 values above 0.9 for char and gas phases. For oil values exceeding 10 grams, the SR models struggled with generalization. Overall, the proposed framework provides a valuable tool for interpreting and modeling pyrolysis process data, enabling its use in the decision-making process.
