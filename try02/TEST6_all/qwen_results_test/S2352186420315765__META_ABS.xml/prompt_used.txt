You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in upgradation of pyrolysis bio-oil and biochar towards improvement in bio-refinery economics: A comprehensive review Depletion of fossil fuel reserves and ever-increasing energy demands necessitates exploring green and renewable biofuels. Though biomass-based fuels have the potential to replace fossil fuels but the low quality of fuels along with high process economics limits direct application. Concept of integrated bio-refinery is the unparalleled solution to this problem which involves the production of hydrocarbon grade fuels along with valuable chemicals from the pyrolysis derived bio-oil. This paper reviews recent advances in upgradation techniques of bio-oil along with moisture removal techniques and recovery of valuable chemicals from bio-oil. It also reviews current advances in the utilization of co-product such as biochar to increase the overall economics of the process. It also elucidates the challenges encountered as well as scope for future work. The current review is peculiarly based on pyrolysis based bio-refinery with detailed literature on the techniques of conversion of pyrolysis derived bio-oil into valuable biofuels and industrial grade chemicals with a view to improve the overall economics of the process through biochar utilization, which is not covered in other reviews. As compared to other published studies, this work provides more comprehensive information on the topic, which will give better understanding to a new researcher as well as help to plan and develop new techniques on bio-refinery for attaining the aim of cleaner and sustainable future.
