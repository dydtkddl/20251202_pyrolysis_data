Hydrogen production by sorption enhanced catalytic pyrolysis of lignin waste in presence of novel potassium stannate Lignocellulosic waste stands out as an abundant and environmentally friendly feedstock to produce biofuels including renewable hydrogen. For the first time, potassium stannate dual functional material (DFM) was synthesised and assessed in the sorption enhanced pyrolysis of lignin waste and compared to zirconates DFMs by thermogravimetric analysis and in a packed bed reactor with online gas analysis. The results indicate that K2SnO3 presents a superior capacity in selectively producing hydrogen at 700 °C with 51 vol% of the gas produced being H2 (45 g H2/kg Etek lignin) with and only 9 vol% CO2, when a lignin: K2SnO3 ratio of 0.5:3 was used. The same DFM with a lignin: K2SnO3 ratio of 1:0.5 promoted the RWGS and Boudouard reactions converting the absorbed CO2 and formed H2 and char into CO at 900 °C. In summary, K2SnO3 is a promising catalyst to produce hydrogen from biomass pyrolysis-reforming.
