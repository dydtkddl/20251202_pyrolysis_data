You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of oil sludge with HDPE to obtain paraffinic products over HUSY zeolites prepared by dealumination and desilication Oil sludge is a waste from the oil industry with a complex composition and its treatment is still a challenge. In addition, polyolefin waste is becoming a problem due to its accumulation and slow degradation. In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis was used to treat oil sludge and high density polyethylene (HDPE) at 450 °C and at an atmospheric pressure for 15 min to generate paraffin-rich oily products. Y zeolites were obtained by dealumination and desilication processes which were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, FTIR, 29Si and 27Al NMR, TG and NH3 TPD. Pristine and modified zeolites were evaluated in the co-pyrolysis in order to assess their performances through the quality of the obtained pyrolytic oil (GC–MS and SimDis). The modificated zeolites presented higher mesoporosity than the original solid as so lower total acidity. Amidst the tested catalysts, Mod-Si-10 and Mod-Al presented the best performances showing high yield of liquid fraction, rich in parafinic light hydrocarbons, probably due to their moderate acidity and improved mesoporosity. Consequently, these two zeolites presented outstanding catalytic characteristics alongside high selectivity to paraffinic hydrocarbons in the diesel fraction from co-pyrolisis of the oil sludge waste with HDPE.
