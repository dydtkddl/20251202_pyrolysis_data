Effect of secondary gas-phase reactions (SGR) in pyrolysis of carbon feedstocks for anisotropic carbon materials production – 2: Effects of SGR on tars produced from varying ranks of coal This work explores the extent to which secondary gas-phase reactions (SGR) in pyrolysis can be used to modify coal tar chemistries from coals of different ranks in favor of improved anisotropy formation in their respective pitches. Pyrolysis was performed on four different coals of varying bituminous rank (Utah Sufco, Wyoming PRB Black Thunder, Illinois #6, and West Virginia Flying Eagle), with SGR temperatures ranging from 800 to 900° C and nominal SGR gas-phase residence times from 1 to 2.5 s. The oxygen content, aliphatic content, and molecular weight distributions of the coal tar samples were measured to indicate the changes with increasing levels of SGR, and microscopy was also used to measure changes in anisotropy formation in the resulting pitch samples. Generally, for all coals tested, increased levels of pyrolysis SGR led to decreased oxygen and aliphatic content, increased molecular weight sizes, and improved anisotropy formation. However, it was clear that the extent of these property changes depended on the chemistry and rank of the starting coal feedstock. Despite the relatively high rank of the Illinois #6 coal, its respective pitch samples performed poorly in improving anisotropy formation, due to its high sulfur content. The PRB, Sufco, and Flying Eagle coals performed better in their anisotropy formation than Illinois #6, depending on their respective coal ranks. Statistical analysis (analysis of variance, ANOVA) performed on the sample characterization data also suggests that SGR temperature is consistently the most dominant and significant effect on the resulting coal products.
