You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of toxic pyrogenic compounds derived from conventional cigarettes and heated tobacco products Heated tobacco products (HTPs) have gained popularity as alternatives to conventional cigarettes (CCs). Nevertheless, assessing their health hazards remains challenging owing to variations in individual smoking habits. Thus, this study aimed to identify toxic compounds from simulated smoking conditions and evaluate their toxicity in humans. Tobacco leaves (TL) and reconstituted tobacco leaves (RTL), sourced from the CCs and HTPs, were used as model feedstocks. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that RTL contained higher nicotine and glycerol levels but lower carbohydrate content than TL. The smoking mechanisms of both tobacco samples were found to be governed by pyrolysis under different temperatures (TL: 200–800 °C and RTL: 350 °C). In TL pyrolysis, the toxic compound formations are influenced by the temperature. Nicotine was dominant at ≤ 400 °C, whereas temperatures ≥ 400 °C led to increased formation of toxic compounds, particularly carcinogens. In contrast, RTL pyrolysis at 350 °C generated fewer carcinogens because controlled heating inhibited thermolysis of the lignocellulosic components. To assess carcinogenicity, peak intensities of TL and RTL-derived carcinogens were normalized using nicotine as an addiction factor. Relative carcinogenicity of RTL was reduced by more than two folds compared with that of TL. This comparative assessment suggests that HTP smoking may reduce exposure to carcinogenic compounds compared to CC smoking, although additional clinical factors should be considered for more accurate assessment of the associated health risks.
