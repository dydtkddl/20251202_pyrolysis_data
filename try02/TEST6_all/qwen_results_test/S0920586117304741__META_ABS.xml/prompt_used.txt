You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading of high-density polyethylene and light cycle oil mixtures to fuels via hydroprocessing The joint valorization of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and light cycle oil (LCO) has been studied via hydroprocessing with the aim of valorizing the HDPE and reducing the sulfur and polyaromatic contents in the LCO. Experiments have been carried out in a batch type reactor under the following conditions: 320–400°C; 80bar; feed:catalyst mass ratio, 20:1; LCO:HDPE mass ratio, 10:1. CoMo/Al catalyst showed higher LCO hydrodesulfurization activity than the other tested catalysts (NiMo/SiAl and NiW/HY), reaching a hydrodesulfurization conversion of 99.3wt% (72ppm of sulfur in the liquid product) at 400°C. Furthermore, a moderate dearomatization was obtained, reaching a polyaromatic conversion of 76wt%. In the hydroprocessing of LCO and HDPE mixture, the joint feeding lightly increases hydrodesulfurization conversion and has no significant impact on product distribution, with HDPE conversion being 31wt%. These results are promising for valorizing waste plastics by incorporating into a first LCO hydroprocessing stage. The hydrodesulfurizated liquid product should be treated in a second hydrocracking stage using a noble metal catalyst supported on strong acid functions.
