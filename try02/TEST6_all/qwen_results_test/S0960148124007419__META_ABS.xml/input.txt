Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge with hydrogen-rich polythene: Effects on synergistic promotion and bio-oil quality Co-pyrolysis of biomass with hydrogen-rich feedstock is a promising technology to improve bio-oil quality, in which understanding the synergistic effects and product of sewage sludge (SS) with two types of plastic waste (HDPE, LDPE) is essential to develop co-pyrolysis technology. This work used in situ tracking to detect co-pyrolysis promotion/inhibition effects with different mixed feedstocks and mixing ratios, and analyzed volatile and bio-oils in detail. The results show that co-pyrolysis synergistic promotion was mainly created by the release of a large amounts of free radicals, and the largest promotion occurred near the maximum mass loss rate (DTGmax). The synergistic promotion effect was 190 % higher for SS mixed with HDPE (S–H) than for SS mixed with LDPE (S-L). Co-pyrolysis reduced polluting gases (e.g., NO2, and SO2), enhanced the degradation of oxygenated functional groups, contains 2.7 times of hydrocarbons in bio-oil than SS mono-pyrolysis. S-L promoted short-chain generation and produced more naphthalene compounds (e.g., methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) in hydrocarbons. However, S–H tends to produce longer chains and more monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., alkylbenzenes). The gasoline fraction in bio-oil could reach 89.7 % (S7L3) and 55.8 % (S5H5). This information helps to promote clean disposal and resource utilization of sewage sludge and plastic waste through co-pyrolysis.
