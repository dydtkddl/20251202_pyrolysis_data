You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Syngas production from co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of polystyrene and paper with CO2 Co-pyrolysis and CO2 co-gasification of paper and polystyrene blends in different mixture ratios were studied at 1173 K using a laboratory scale tube reactor and thermogravimetric analysis. The chemical composition and yield of the syngas produced was analyzed by a micro gas chromatograph to understand the influence of mixture components. Co-pyrolysis positively impacted the syngas yield exhibiting a synergistic influence on cracking reactions leading to increased gaseous yield having almost double the amounts of hydrogen yield. Co-gasification using CO2 increased the total gas yield with enhanced synergistic conversion. This effect provided a non-linear impact on the combustible gases in the gaseous yields when compared to the separate gasification of these feedstocks. The synergistic enhancement of co-pyrolysis conversion in paper-polystyrene led to lower char present for CO2 to react during CO2 co-gasification that lead to lower CO during the gasification of this blended char residue. The mixtures of paper with polystyrene provided increased product gas yields and enhanced conversion with an increase in polystyrene content. The results showed the effectiveness of producing high energy density syngas from co-gasification which can alleviate material handling issues present in segregation of waste, such as plastics and biomass providing uniform valuable product from diverse waste feedstocks with minimal need for classification.
