Insights into the recycling of discarded solar panels: Challenges and future outlook Solar panels are one of the most eminent resources of renewable source of energy which came in existence as an alternative to non-renewable resources of energy. However, currently it has become a source of hazardous e-waste subsequent to the end-of-life period of 25–30 years. A report by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2016 estimated the generation of 78 million tons of e-waste from solar panels. These solar panels contain carcinogenic metals such as lead, and cadmium that need to be removed. Also, they contain materials like silicon, aluminium, silver, and copper which can be recovered along with polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and tedlar. This review paper presents different types of solar panels with a major focus on majorly used crystalline solar panels and thin film solar panels. The composition of these types of solar panels, and method of their recovery has been critically analysed w.r.t. reported literature to understand the possibilities for developing sustainable technologies for the valuable resource recovery. The major challenges and future prospects are also discussed. It will be an important resource to provide comprehensive understanding of this topic to a researcher who is new in this area.
