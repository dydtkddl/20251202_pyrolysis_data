You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in the production methods and recycling of multilayer plastics with sustainable applications: A comprehensive review In recent years, multilayer polymers (MLPs) have become increasingly popular because of their excellent barrier properties and long-lasting durability, which make them well-suited for a wide range of packaging applications. These barrier properties include the prevention of gas (oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen), moisture, aroma, and light permeation, ensuring product quality, freshness, and extended shelf life. However, their complex structures and widespread use present significant challenges for recycling, with limited practical solutions available. Mono-material MLPs offer a more sustainable and recyclable alternative compared to multi-material MLPs. Additionally, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of layer-by-layer assembly may provide an advantage over traditional MLP manufacturing techniques. This review focuses on the production, properties, and recycling processes of multilayer films. It covers prior research on various recycling methods, including biochemical, thermochemical, mechanical, and chemical approaches. Specific chemical recycling methods, including methanolysis, aminolysis, delamination, glycolysis, hydrolysis, solvent-based techniques, and catalytic depolymerization, are extensively explored. The review also emphasizes the established pyrolysis method and investigates the potential of biological recycling methods, such as enzyme-mediated catalysis. Emerging technologies and innovative solutions, such as the use of compostable plastics, biodegradable materials, cellulose-based products, and bio-based polymers, are discussed as pathways to achieving a circular economy. The life cycle assessment (LCA) of MLP recycling is analyzed, along with its economic implications. The review emphasizes the importance of ongoing research, innovation, and industry-wide collaboration in addressing the environmental challenges posed by multilayer plastics and fostering a sustainable future. This resource aims to guide prospective researchers in developing and implementing sustainable MLP recycling strategies.
