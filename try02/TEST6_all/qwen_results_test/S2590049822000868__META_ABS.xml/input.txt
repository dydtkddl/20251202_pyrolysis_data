Nanoscale advanced carbons as an anode for lithium-ion battery Nanoscale advanced carbons, including carbon nanotube, graphene, carbon nanosphere, porous carbon, and their derivatives, are represented as distinct types of material generate in various forms, structure dimensions, and properties. They feature a large specific surface area, excellent conductivity, high mechanical properties, tunable chemical functionality, and a broad potential window, which essentially require for lithium-ion battery systems. The nanoscale advanced carbons have been intensively researched and developed as a negative electrode component to improve battery performance. This review deliberately discusses structures, main properties, and synthesis methods that are directly related to the physical properties and chemical behaviors of the nanoscale advanced carbons. Moreover, currently good candidates for anode material for lithium-ion batteries were summarized. The importance of the primary function and the synergistic effect of nanoscale advanced carbons with active electrode species is emphasized. The systematic information from this review provides a promising tool that represents an essential reference for selecting anode electrode materials and designing the next generation of advanced lithium-ion batteries.
