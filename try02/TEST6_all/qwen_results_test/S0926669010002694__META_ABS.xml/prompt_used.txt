You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric analysis and the optimisation of bio-oil yield from fixed-bed pyrolysis of rice husk using response surface methodology (RSM) The effects of pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, particle size, holding time, and gas flow rate were investigated to optimize bio-oil yield from rice husk pyrolysis. Thermogravimetric analysis showed thermal degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin, indicating faster decomposition of cellulose compared to lignin. The optimisation process was analysed by employing central composite design (CCD) in response surface methodology (RSM) using Design Expert Version 7.5.1 (StatEase, USA). A two-level fractional factorial was initially carried out and followed by RSM. The statistical analysis showed that pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, particle size and holding time significantly affected the bio-oil yield. By utilising response surface method, these four factors were investigated, analysed and optimal conditions were obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 473.37°C, heating rate of 100°C/min, particle size of 0.6mm and holding time of 1min. Confirmation runs gave 48.30% and 47.80% of bio-oil yield compared to 48.10% of predicted value. Furthermore, the pyrolytic bio-oils obtained from fixed-bed pyrolysis were examined using gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) methods, elemental analyzer, pH probe and bomb calorimeter.
