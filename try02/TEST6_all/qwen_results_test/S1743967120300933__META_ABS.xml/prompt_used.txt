You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of process parameters and catalytic pyrolysis of Cascabela thevetia seeds over low-cost catalysts towards renewable fuel production The present study deals with the optimization of process parameters and thermocatalytic pyrolysis of Cascabela thevetia (CT) seeds in a semi-batch cylindrical-shaped reactor. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for the optimization of process variables, while commercial catalysts CaO and Al2O3 were used for catalytic pyrolysis. From results, it was concluded that 525 °C temperature, 75 °C min−1 heating rate, and 75 mL min−1 flow of nitrogen yielded maximum pyrolytic liquid (45.26 wt%) while with the attendance of catalysts at 20 wt% increased the yield of pyrolytic liquid (49.12 wt% and 46.87 wt% for CaO and Al2O3 respectively). Optimization outcomes displayed that linear and quadratic terms of utilized factors were more noteworthy while interaction effects between the factors were not significant. Further, characterization of pyrolytic oil established that utilization of catalysts expressively enhanced its properties by reducing viscosity and boosted the calorific value. FTIR examination of pyrolytic oil showed that the attendance of phenols, ethers, alcohols, ketones, alkanes, acids, etc., while 1H NMR results supported the FTIR results. GC-MS analysis showed a substantial reduction of phenols and oxygen-rich products and boost the development of alcohol and aldehydes in pyrolytic oil with the introduction of catalysts. These parameters indicate improved properties of pyrolytic oil, which intensified its bioenergy capabilities.
