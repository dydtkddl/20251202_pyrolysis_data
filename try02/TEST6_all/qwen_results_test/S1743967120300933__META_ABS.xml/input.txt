Optimization of process parameters and catalytic pyrolysis of Cascabela thevetia seeds over low-cost catalysts towards renewable fuel production The present study deals with the optimization of process parameters and thermocatalytic pyrolysis of Cascabela thevetia (CT) seeds in a semi-batch cylindrical-shaped reactor. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for the optimization of process variables, while commercial catalysts CaO and Al2O3 were used for catalytic pyrolysis. From results, it was concluded that 525 °C temperature, 75 °C min−1 heating rate, and 75 mL min−1 flow of nitrogen yielded maximum pyrolytic liquid (45.26 wt%) while with the attendance of catalysts at 20 wt% increased the yield of pyrolytic liquid (49.12 wt% and 46.87 wt% for CaO and Al2O3 respectively). Optimization outcomes displayed that linear and quadratic terms of utilized factors were more noteworthy while interaction effects between the factors were not significant. Further, characterization of pyrolytic oil established that utilization of catalysts expressively enhanced its properties by reducing viscosity and boosted the calorific value. FTIR examination of pyrolytic oil showed that the attendance of phenols, ethers, alcohols, ketones, alkanes, acids, etc., while 1H NMR results supported the FTIR results. GC-MS analysis showed a substantial reduction of phenols and oxygen-rich products and boost the development of alcohol and aldehydes in pyrolytic oil with the introduction of catalysts. These parameters indicate improved properties of pyrolytic oil, which intensified its bioenergy capabilities.
