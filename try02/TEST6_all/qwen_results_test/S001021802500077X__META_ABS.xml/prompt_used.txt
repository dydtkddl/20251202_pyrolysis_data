You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An experimental and modeling study on norbornane pyrolysis aided by chemical information from neural network-assisted molecular dynamics Norbornane has been reported in recent years as a diesel additive that can improve soot characteristics or as the backbone of new jet fuels to increase fuel density and the net heat of combustion. However, there is still a lack of experimental and modeling studies on norbornane pyrolysis, which limits its further application. This work uses a flow tube reactor to conduct experiments at 30 torr, 923 K ∼ 1373 K, with a photoionization molecular-beam mass spectrometer to identify and quantify the pyrolysis species. At the same time, an attempt is made to apply high-precision deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) to assist in kinetic model construction. Species analysis on MD simulations provides additional chemical information on key pyrolysis species in the norbornane pyrolysis system, which agrees with experimental results. Therefore, the reactions appearing in MD simulations are supposed to play a nonnegligible role in the experimental system, so that high-frequency reactions of selected are added to the pyrolysis kinetic model. Further comparison of experimental and modeling results shows that the modeling results can accurately predict experimental concentrations for most species. By analyzing the rate of production of all species in the system, we highlight their primary production and consumption pathways, especially the pathways from norbornane to benzene in the system. When conducting sensitivity analysis, it is found that the initial decomposition reactions of the fuel have large sensitivity coefficients on the experimental results, especially the concentration of norbornane; it is also noteworthy that the reactions extracted in the MD results have an essential impact on the concentration of 1,3-cyclohexadiene.
