Microplastics contamination associated with low-value domestic source organic solid waste: A review Waste activated sludge and food waste are two typical important domestic low-value organic solid wastes (LOSW). LOSW contains significant organic matter and water content resulting in the transboundary transfer of liquid-solid-gas and other multi-mediums, such that the complexity of microplastics (MPs) migration should be of greater concern. This article provides a review of the literature focusing on the separation and extraction methods of MPs from LOSW. The occurrence and source of MPs are discussed, and the output and impact of MPs on LOSW heat and biological treatments are summarized. The fate and co-effects of MPs and other pollutants in landfills and soils are reviewed. This review highlights the migration and transformation of MPs in domestic source LOSW, and future perspectives focused on the development of a unified extraction and analysis protocol. The objective of this review is to promote the technological development of decontamination of MPs in LOSW by sufficient understanding of the fate of MPs, their interaction with coexisting pollutants and the development of targeted preventive research strategies.
