You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fuel production based on catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires as an optimized model Recently, the pyrolysis of wastes has been considered as a promising alternative for dealing with this issue. In this study, pyrolysis of waste tire was conducted using MgCl2 as catalyst in a batch reactor under atmosphere of argon. The experiments of pyrolysis were designed by response surface modeling of process parameters, including particle size of waste tire slices, flow rate of argon gas, amount of catalyst, and time and temperature of pyrolysis, related to the corresponding yields of oil, gas, and char. As objectives of this work, influences of parameters and their interactions were examined to maximize oil, and minimize gas and char. The oil product was maximized using the conditions, including pyrolysis temperature of 407.3°C, pyrolysis time of 1800s, flow rate of 133.7mLmin−1, particle size of 12.5mm, and 11.5wt% of catalyst. Additionally, the highest gaseous product was also obtained when the temperature of pyrolysis, feed size, flow rate of argon, amount of catalyst, and pyrolysis time were 475.0°C, 5.0mm, 250.0mLmin−1, 0.1wt%, and 5009 s, respectively. Moreover, the pyrolytic char was converted to activated one with the specific surface area and activating yield of 1296m2 g−1 and 16.3 wt%, respectively, using steam activation unit. Furthermore, the physical properties of the final oil product, including cetane number, density, viscosity, and flash point were compared with other commercial diesel fuels. These quality factors were obtained 47, 847kgm−3, 2.4mm2 s−1, and 48°C, respectively. At last, using of MgCl2 declined the sulfur content of final oil to 0.38wt%.
