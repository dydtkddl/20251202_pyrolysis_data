You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical characterization of refuse derived fuel (RDF) using Py-GC/MS The conversion of municipal solid waste (MSW) to refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and its utilization as an alternative fuel in the cement industry has been an emerging trend. However, RDF is highly heterogeneous, with its complex composition changing with season and source. This work is focused on the chemical characterization of six RDF samples listed as A, B, C, D, E, and F from different locations across the country using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), thermogravimetric instrument and CHONS elemental analyzer. Qualitative and semi-quantitative results were obtained using EGA, single-shot and double-shot analysis methods. EGA has been used to derive qualitative results in correlation with TGA. FTIR analysis was carried out to understand the initial functional characterization. XRF analysis along with ICP-MS triple quad revealed the inorganic makeup of the samples. Single-shot results indicated that apart from non-hydrocarbon gases (CO2 and O2), the long-chain alkenes were most abundant, followed by alkanes, aromatic compounds, and ketones. Double-shot analysis indicated the presence of chloride and sulphur-based compounds in RDF samples as limiting components. Polystyrene contribution to LHV of RDF has been highlighted. The study can be further used to conduct compositional studies of RDF and its pyrolytic behavior in the gasifier. It will further strengthen the future gasifier models where pyrolysis is one of the critical steps. This technique will be very helpful in obtaining a better characterization of volatile and non-volatile (bio-oil and ash) fractions of the pyrolytic products.
