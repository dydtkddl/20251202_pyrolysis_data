Chemical characterization of refuse derived fuel (RDF) using Py-GC/MS The conversion of municipal solid waste (MSW) to refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and its utilization as an alternative fuel in the cement industry has been an emerging trend. However, RDF is highly heterogeneous, with its complex composition changing with season and source. This work is focused on the chemical characterization of six RDF samples listed as A, B, C, D, E, and F from different locations across the country using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), thermogravimetric instrument and CHONS elemental analyzer. Qualitative and semi-quantitative results were obtained using EGA, single-shot and double-shot analysis methods. EGA has been used to derive qualitative results in correlation with TGA. FTIR analysis was carried out to understand the initial functional characterization. XRF analysis along with ICP-MS triple quad revealed the inorganic makeup of the samples. Single-shot results indicated that apart from non-hydrocarbon gases (CO2 and O2), the long-chain alkenes were most abundant, followed by alkanes, aromatic compounds, and ketones. Double-shot analysis indicated the presence of chloride and sulphur-based compounds in RDF samples as limiting components. Polystyrene contribution to LHV of RDF has been highlighted. The study can be further used to conduct compositional studies of RDF and its pyrolytic behavior in the gasifier. It will further strengthen the future gasifier models where pyrolysis is one of the critical steps. This technique will be very helpful in obtaining a better characterization of volatile and non-volatile (bio-oil and ash) fractions of the pyrolytic products.
