You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of paper-laminated phenolic printed circuit boards and calcium-based additives in fixed and fluidized bed reactors This study compares the impact of the calcium-based additives and the pyrolyzer on the recovery and the halide content of the oil produced from the pyrolysis of paper-laminated phenolic resin printed circuit boards (FR2-PCB). The preliminary experiments showed that the maximum liquid recovery (40.6%) was achieved in a fluidized bed pyrolyzer containing a 50:50 mixture of CaO and Ca(OH)2 operating at T = 620 °C and PCB-to-additive ratio (FR2/A) = 5.4 g/g for 22 min. Extra tests were then carried out under these conditions in fixed and fluidized bed pyrolyzers to separately explore the impact of CaO, Ca(OH)2, and CaO + Ca(OH)2 on the liquid recovery (L R) and the halogen content of the non-solid products. In the fluidized bed, L R in the presence of CaO, Ca(OH)2, and CaO + Ca(OH)2 was 34.5%, 41.2%, and 38.9 wt%, respectively. The fraction of phenolic compounds in the pyrolysis oil ranged from 86% to 93%, about 1–3% higher than the corresponding values in the fixed bed. Using additives led to lower halide content in the pyrolysis oil of the fluidized bed than that of the fixed bed. However, the opposite trend was observed in the absence of additives. Regardless of the type of pyrolyzer, Ca(OH)2 was more successful than CaO in increasing L R, whereas CaO was more effective than Ca(OH)2 in pyrolysis oil dechlorination. Co-pyrolysis of FR2-PCB and CaO + Ca(OH)2 in a fluidized bed reactor was identified as a practical approach to enhance the recovery of pyrolysis oil comprising only 5% of the original halogen content of the feedstock.
