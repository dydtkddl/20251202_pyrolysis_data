You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

NiAlxFe2−xO4 mixed oxide catalysts for methane reforming with CO2: Effect of Al vs Fe contents and precursor salts NiAlxFe2−xO4 (0 ≤x ≤ 2) was synthesized, characterized and evaluated in methane reforming with CO2 without any pretreatment. It was shown that the nature of the precursor has a significant effect on the structural, textural and reactivity properties. The cell parameters decrease with increasing Al-content which can be explained by the partial substitution of Fe3+ ions (∼0.63 Å in tetrahedral site and ∼0.78 Å and high spin in octahedral site) by Al3+ ions (∼0.53 Å) either in the tetrahedral or the octahedral sites. If, on the one hand, the catalytic activity of the aluminum compound exhibits high CH4 and CO2 conversions as well as excellent syngas selectivity, on the other hand, a poor activity is observed for NiFe2O4 whatever the precursors. For low temperatures (T < 750 °C), powders prepared with chlorides are more active than powders prepared with nitrates. However, this behavior mitigates at high temperature. NiAl2O4 issued from nitrate precursors shows the best catalytic performances. Negligible contributions to WGS Reaction are illustrated by H2/CO ratios close to stoichiometry. The intermediate FeAl2O4 spinel phase plays an important role as catalytic precursor in the in-situ production of Ni° nanoparticles, highly dispersed and less prone to coke formation in spite of the severe reaction conditions. A lack of affinity of Al-species to combine with Ni° to form detrimental Ni-Al alloy is proposed to explain the good performances. Strong interactions developed between metallic active sites and mixed oxides substrates allow the stabilization and improvement of catalytic performances in dry reforming of methane.
