You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-oxidative conversion of real low density polyethylene waste into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials over MgO supported bimetallic Co-Mo catalysts with different total Co-Mo contents A series of bimetallic CoMo/MgO catalysts with different total metal contents from 10 up to 60 wt% and a fixed Co/Mo weight ratio of 4/1 were prepared and employed for the first time to transform real low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials through a two-stage process. The waste was thermally cracked at 500 °C to non-condensable gases which then decomposed over CoMo/MgO catalysts at 700 °C to obtain the desired products. Both fresh and spent CoMo/MgO catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, FTIR, Raman, BET, TEM, and TGA techniques. The results showed that the catalytic activity and stability were increased with the successive increase of CoMo content up to 40 wt%. Both 30CoMo/MgO and 40CoMo/MgO catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity where more than 90% H2 yield was obtained. This behavior could be attributed to the excessive formation of different types of mixed oxide species such as MgCoOx, CoMoOx and MgMoOx as shown from XRD, TPR and Raman results. In fact, the presence of these species enhances the dispersion and stabilization of Co and Mo particles in the catalyst matrix, resulting in improved catalyst performance. TEM, Raman spectra, and TGA results showed that high-quality CNMs with various structures such as regular, bamboo, cup stacked carbon nanotubes were deposited over all CoMo/MgO catalysts depending on the CoMo content.
