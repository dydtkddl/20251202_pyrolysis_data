You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast reaction behaviors of AB-type Ti-Fe-Mn hydrogen storage alloys from lattice modification and in-situ formed yttrium hydride Ti-based hydrogen storage alloy is considered a potential candidate for stationary hydrogen storage due to the ability to absorb and desorb H2 at ambient temperatures. To achieve fast activation and high hydrogen storage capacity, the microstructural features and hydrogen storage behaviors of the AB-type Ti1- x Y x Fe0.8Mn0.2 alloys are investigated. With the addition of Y, only a small part of Y is dissolved into the TiFe phase, and most of Y forms a dispersed α-Y phase in the alloy. The incubation period for the first hydrogenation of the alloy at 100 °C decreased from 4360 s to 180 s. This is mainly attributed to the alloy fragmentation caused by the hydrogenation expansion of α-Y phase. The hydrogenation capacity of the Ti0.95Y0.05Fe0.8Mn0.2 alloy is 1.79 wt% at 30 °C, which is only 0.06 wt% lower than the TiFe0.8Mn0.2 alloy. The dehydrogenation behavior of the alloy conforms to the G-B model, which indicates that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is the main limiting factor. The dispersed YH x phase accelerates the diffusion of hydrogen atoms, resulting in a decrease in the dehydrogenation enthalpy change value, and the dehydrogenation of the alloy hydride changes from two steps to one step.
