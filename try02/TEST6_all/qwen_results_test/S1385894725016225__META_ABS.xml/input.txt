Fast reaction behaviors of AB-type Ti-Fe-Mn hydrogen storage alloys from lattice modification and in-situ formed yttrium hydride Ti-based hydrogen storage alloy is considered a potential candidate for stationary hydrogen storage due to the ability to absorb and desorb H2 at ambient temperatures. To achieve fast activation and high hydrogen storage capacity, the microstructural features and hydrogen storage behaviors of the AB-type Ti1- x Y x Fe0.8Mn0.2 alloys are investigated. With the addition of Y, only a small part of Y is dissolved into the TiFe phase, and most of Y forms a dispersed α-Y phase in the alloy. The incubation period for the first hydrogenation of the alloy at 100 °C decreased from 4360 s to 180 s. This is mainly attributed to the alloy fragmentation caused by the hydrogenation expansion of α-Y phase. The hydrogenation capacity of the Ti0.95Y0.05Fe0.8Mn0.2 alloy is 1.79 wt% at 30 °C, which is only 0.06 wt% lower than the TiFe0.8Mn0.2 alloy. The dehydrogenation behavior of the alloy conforms to the G-B model, which indicates that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is the main limiting factor. The dispersed YH x phase accelerates the diffusion of hydrogen atoms, resulting in a decrease in the dehydrogenation enthalpy change value, and the dehydrogenation of the alloy hydride changes from two steps to one step.
