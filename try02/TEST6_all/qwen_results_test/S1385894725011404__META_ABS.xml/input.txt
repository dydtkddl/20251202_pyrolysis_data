Delamination of components for recovery of waste crystalline photovoltaic modules by three-step treatments of separating fluorinated coating, heating and ultrasonication The rapid development of the photovoltaic industry inevitably brings massive numbers of end-of-life and damaged photovoltaic panels, which are rich in recyclable resources such as plastics, metals, and glass. Therefore, recovery of waste photovoltaic panels is a meaning work from the aspects of circular economy and sustainable development of photovoltaic industry. A critical challenge in the recovery of photovoltaic modules is the efficient destruction of adhesion of ethylene–vinyl acetate to facilitate the delamination of each panels. In this study, N,N-Dimethylacetamide was identified as a solvent capable of penetrating the cross-linked ethylene–vinyl acetate structure and cause its properties to change. Under the optimal process parameters, more than 99 % of the ethylene–vinyl acetate area has lost its original strong adhesion. Using ultrasonic and heat treatment, the delamination of the glass, backsheet, and ethylene–vinyl acetate film from the solar cell was significantly accelerated. Photovoltaic module were immersed in N,N-Dimethylacetamide in the whole treatment process. It was soaked at 25℃ for 5 min to separate the fluorinated coating, treated at 160℃ for 10 min to delaminate the glass. The remaining panel treated at 800 W power and 20 kHz ultrasound for 10 min, ethylene–vinyl acetate, backsheet and bonding wire can be separated from solar cell. This work provides novel technology for the delamination of waste photovoltaic modules for resource utilization.
