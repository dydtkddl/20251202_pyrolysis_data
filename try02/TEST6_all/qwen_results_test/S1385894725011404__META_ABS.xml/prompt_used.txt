You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Delamination of components for recovery of waste crystalline photovoltaic modules by three-step treatments of separating fluorinated coating, heating and ultrasonication The rapid development of the photovoltaic industry inevitably brings massive numbers of end-of-life and damaged photovoltaic panels, which are rich in recyclable resources such as plastics, metals, and glass. Therefore, recovery of waste photovoltaic panels is a meaning work from the aspects of circular economy and sustainable development of photovoltaic industry. A critical challenge in the recovery of photovoltaic modules is the efficient destruction of adhesion of ethylene–vinyl acetate to facilitate the delamination of each panels. In this study, N,N-Dimethylacetamide was identified as a solvent capable of penetrating the cross-linked ethylene–vinyl acetate structure and cause its properties to change. Under the optimal process parameters, more than 99 % of the ethylene–vinyl acetate area has lost its original strong adhesion. Using ultrasonic and heat treatment, the delamination of the glass, backsheet, and ethylene–vinyl acetate film from the solar cell was significantly accelerated. Photovoltaic module were immersed in N,N-Dimethylacetamide in the whole treatment process. It was soaked at 25℃ for 5 min to separate the fluorinated coating, treated at 160℃ for 10 min to delaminate the glass. The remaining panel treated at 800 W power and 20 kHz ultrasound for 10 min, ethylene–vinyl acetate, backsheet and bonding wire can be separated from solar cell. This work provides novel technology for the delamination of waste photovoltaic modules for resource utilization.
