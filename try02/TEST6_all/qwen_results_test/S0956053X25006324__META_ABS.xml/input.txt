Utilization routes of plastic waste from the marine environment: a review Plastic pollution in the marine environment has become a global concern due to its ecological impacts, persistence, and difficulty in removal. To address this issue, various routes are being explored, not only to remove plastic waste from marine environments but also to repurpose and recycle it. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the latest research conducted over the past five years in the monitoring, collection, cleaning, recycling, and valorization of marine plastic litter. The attention is given to emerging technologies and strategies for monitoring and recovery from oceans, rivers, and shorelines. Cleaning and pretreatment methods are evaluated for their effectiveness in removing marine origin contaminants without compromising polymer integrity. A detailed comparison of recycling possibilities for marine plastic waste are preseted, including mechanical, chemical, and solvent-based methods, as well as alternative utilization routes such upcycling into art, and conversion to fuels, functional materials or energy recovery. By synthesizing recent findings, we aim to highlight advancements in understanding the pathways of marine plastic litter, the challenges associated with its management, and innovative approaches to its reuse.
