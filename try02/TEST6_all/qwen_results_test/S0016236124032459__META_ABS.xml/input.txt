Advancements, mechanisms, and challenges in the catalytic conversion of coal, coal tar, model compounds, and coal+x: An in-depth analysis of light aromatics preparation and future perspectives Exploring the compatibility between the molecular structure and compositional characteristics of coal and the physicochemical properties of catalysts is crucial. It not only aids in understanding the reaction mechanisms for the catalytic conversion of coal and its derivatives into high-value chemicals, but also contributes significantly to addressing key global issues, such as environmental degradation and the diminishing petroleum resources. In this review, we provide an in-depth summary of the evolutionary mechanisms and structure–activity relationships of various catalysts and their pretreatment methods in converting coal, coal tar, model compounds, and coal+x into high-value chemicals, particularly light aromatics. Furthermore, this review meticulously assesses the individual physical and chemical properties of catalysts, as well as their synergistic interactions, to understand how these elements affect the production of high-value light aromatics, with a particular focus on the mechanisms and trends at play. Finally, this review summarizes the challenges encountered in the catalytic conversion of coal, coal tar, model compounds, and coal+x into high-value light aromatics. It also outlines future research directions and prospects. In summary, this study holds significant strategic value, promoting the high-value utilization of coal, alleviating oil shortages and environmental degradation, and enhancing energy security and sustainable development.
