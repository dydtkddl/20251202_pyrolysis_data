You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced catalytic oxidative depolymerization of lignin to aromatic compounds by activated carbon-supported polyoxometalate-ionic liquid catalysts Lignin, a major component in renewable plant biomass, serves as a potential source of high-value aromatic chemicals. However, efficiently decomposing lignin while maintaining its aromaticity for fossil fuel substitution remains a significant challenge. This study synthesized a [VimAm]Br@POM@AC catalyst, composed of a Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) modified by ionic liquid ([VimAm]Br) and supported on activated carbon (AC). The response-surface methodology was applied to explore the catalytic performance of this catalyst in the oxidative depolymerization of lignin β-O-4 model compounds. Under the reaction conditions of 160 °C, 3 mL H2O2, and 0.4 g catalyst within 8 h, the conversion rate of lignin model compounds reached 83.01 %. The reaction generated diverse aromatic products, with the selectivity of methyl mandelate and methyl benzoate reaching 27.70 % and 59.02 %, respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the [VimAm]Br@POM@AC catalyst selectively cleaves CO bonds in β-O-4 dimers, facilitating the formation of aromatic compounds. Moreover, FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM analysis confirmed the good stability of the recovered catalyst. This work achieves efficient directional conversion of lignin model compounds through the design of a multilevel-structured catalyst, precise optimization of reaction conditions, and innovative mechanistic interpretation. It offers a novel strategy with both academic significance and application potential for the high-value utilization of biomass resources.
