Upcycling of PET oligomers from chemical recycling processes to PHA by microbial co-cultivation Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most widely consumed polyester plastic and can be recycled by many chemical processes, of which glycolysis is most cost-effective and commercially viable. However, PET glycolysis produces oligomers due to incomplete depolymerization, which are undesirable by-products and require proper disposal. In this study, the PET oligomers from chemical recycling processes were completely bio-depolymerized into monomers and then used for the biosynthesis of biodegradable plastics polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) by co-cultivation of two engineered microorganisms Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)-LCCICCG and Pseudomonas putida KT2440-ΔRDt-ΔZP46C-M. E. coli BL21 (DE3)-LCCICCG was used to secrete the PET hydrolase LCCICCG into the medium to directly depolymerize PET oligomers. P. putida KT2440-ΔRDt-ΔZP46C-M that mastered the metabolism of aromatic compounds was engineered to accelerate the hydrolysis of intermediate products mono-2-(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) by expressing IsMHETase, and biosynthesize PHA using ultimate products terephthalate and ethylene glycol depolymerized from the PET oligomers. The population ratios of the two microorganisms during the co-cultivation were characterized by fluorescent reporter system, and revealed the collaboration of the two microorganisms to bio-depolymerize and bioconversion of PET oligomers in a single process. This study provides a biological strategy for the upcycling of PET oligomers and promotes the plastic circular economy.
