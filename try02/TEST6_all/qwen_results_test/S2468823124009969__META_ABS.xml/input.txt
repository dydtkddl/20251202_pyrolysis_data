Innovations in packed-bed reactors utilizing immobilized lipase catalysts: A comprehensive technical and scientific review Heterogeneous immobilized lipase catalysts have been widely used in packed-bed reactors (PBR) in industry. This reactor configuration provides an environment with low shear forces, allows the catalyst to be easily recovered and reused, and continuously removes products and substrates not consumed by the reaction. This reduces inhibition of enzymatic activity and enables greater operational stability. This review aims to conduct a technical-scientific evaluation of the use of PBR with immobilized lipase catalysts. Therefore, the state-of-the-art was conducted by selecting articles published between 2019 and 2024. They were analyzed and discussed innovatively, focusing not only on the production methodologies of these enzymatic catalysts but also on the characteristics that make them suitable for the flow reactor, immobilization methods, reactor configurations, operational limitations, and process intensification techniques. The use of immobilized lipase catalysts in PBR is mainly limited by external mass transfer phenomena, which are among the most important topics discussed. This review could significantly contribute to advancing research into reactions catalyzed by lipases.
