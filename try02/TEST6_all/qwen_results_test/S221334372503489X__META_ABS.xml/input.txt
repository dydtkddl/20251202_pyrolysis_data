Coordination engineering of MOF-derived bimetallic catalysts for advanced oxidation of organic pollutants The persistent presence of organic pollutants in aquatic environments poses a significant threat to ecosystems and human health, demanding the development of efficient and sustainable degradation technologies. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), driven by heterogeneous catalysts, have emerged as a powerful strategy for the mineralization of recalcitrant contaminants. Among them, bimetallic catalysts derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant interest owing to their promising features, including high surface area (>1000 m²/g), tunable porosity, and robust redox-active sites. Coordination engineering enables atomic-level tuning of the metal-ligand environment, enhancing catalytic activity through electronic modulation and synergistic metal interactions. In particular, coordination engineering manipulating the metal-ligand environment at the atomic level offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance catalytic performance through controlled electronic structures and synergistic bimetallic behavior. Studies report that MOF-derived bimetallic systems can achieve pollutant degradation rate constants exceeding 1.3 min⁻¹ and removal efficiencies over 95 % within 10 min, outperforming monometallic analogs by up to 8–10 times. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in coordination engineering of MOF-derived bimetallic catalysts for AOP applications. We discuss fundamental principles of coordination chemistry within MOFs and their transformation into functional catalysts, focusing on synthetic strategies and structural tailoring. Special attention is given to their mechanistic insights into reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and pollutant degradation pathways, elucidating the roles of coordination environment and metal synergy. Additionally, we highlight current challenges including stability, scalability, and mechanistic complexity, and propose future research directions toward rational catalyst design and real-world implementation. This review aims to bridge the gap between materials design and environmental application, guiding the development of next-generation catalysts for sustainable water treatment.
