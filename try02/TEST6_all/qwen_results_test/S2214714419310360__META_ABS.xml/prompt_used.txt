You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Addition of biochar into activated sludge improves removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin This study evaluated the effectiveness of treating a ciprofloxacin (CIP)-containing waste stream by activated sludge dosed with apple-tree-derived biochar (AB). AB was dosed to activated sludge-inoculated bioreactors with varied AB volume ratios (10 %, 20 %, and 40 % of AB to the total volume). The AB-dosed bioreactors were operated by feeding by 1 mg L−1 of CIP. At steady state, the AB-dosed bioreactors achieved significantly enhanced CIP removal (up to 94 %) and the removal efficiency was positively correlated with the AB volume ratio, suggesting the key role of AB on controlling the removal efficiency of AB. The CIP removals occurring in the bioreactors at steady state were largely through adsorption to AB. This work further carried out systematic assessment on the adsorption kinetics, isotherm, and characteristics of CIP on AB in variable environmental conditions. CIP adsorption onto AB was controlled by diffusion in macropores, π-π electron-donor-acceptor interactions, and electrostatic attraction. Our results suggested that hardwood-derived biochar may be a promising bio-waste additive for improving micropollutant removals in activated sludge processes, which has implications on further devising a simple and cost-effective treatment option for antibiotics-bearing waste streams.
