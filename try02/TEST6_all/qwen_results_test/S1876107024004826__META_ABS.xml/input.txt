Impact of phenolic substances in coal pyrolysis wastewater on efficacy of short-cut nitrification and denitrification Background The heightened concentration of phenolic substances in coal pyrolysis wastewater poses a substantial challenge to NH4 +-N treatment. The effective regulation of the short-cut nitrification and denitrification processes proves to be intricate in practical applications especially in the presence of phenolic substances. The theme of this study is to explore the impact of phenolic substances on efficacy of short-cut nitrification and denitrification. Thus, achieving synchronous and effective removal of phenolic substances and NH4 +-N in coal chemical wastewater. Methods This investigation utilized a sequencing batch reactor. Contents main include (1) continuous monitoring of the removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and volatile phenols; (2) Examination of the accumulation patterns of nitrite nitrogen (NO2 --N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3 --N) during the short-cut nitrification process; (3) Observation of alterations in sludge properties pre and post-experimentation; and (4) Comprehensive analysis of the influence of phenols on microbial diversity, community structure, and functional gene prediction. Significant findings The NO2 --N accumulation ratio was consistently maintained above 90 %. Upon stabilization, the TN removal ratio approximated 97 %. No detectable volatile phenols were present in the effluent of the short-cut nitrification stage. The accumulation of NO2 --N trailed the transformation of NH4 +-N. At a volatile phenol concentration of 180 mg/L, the ratio of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification reached 39.03 %. Predominant bacteria included Acinetobacter (15.26 %), Thauera (8.05 %), and Ferruginibacter (6.39 %), exhibiting proficiency in aromatic compound degradation. The introduction of phenolic substances diminished the proportion of ammonia oxidation bacteria within the primary nitrifying functional bacteria to 75.33 %. Microbial community structure exhibited substantial variation at the species level, with denitrifying facultative bacteria utilized for phenol degradation occupying a dominant role. Nitrosomonas europaea and Acinetobacter pittii demonstrated optimal adaptability to coal pyrolysis wastewater. The proposition of achieving short-cut nitrification and denitrification in coal pyrolysis wastewater by introducing these two bacterial agents holds merit. Functional prediction analysis results indicated an augmented relative abundance of microorganisms with capabilities for aromatic compound degradation and nitrification, signifying the system's robust adaptability to phenolic substances in coal pyrolysis wastewater.
