You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Depolymerization of polystyrene over Mgx-Aly-O catalysts derived from hydrotalcites: Effect of Mg/Al ratio on the basicity and catalytic performance A series of hydrotalcites with various Mg/Al contents were prepared by a solid state reaction. They were then calcined at 450℃ to form a series of Mgx-Aly-O catalysts with different Mg/Al ratios for use in the depolymerization of polystyrene (PS) in a batch reactor. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), induced coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurements. The characterization results showed that the Mgx-Aly-O mixed metal oxide catalysts were successfully synthesized as attempted in this work. Basicity of Mgx-Aly-O catalysts was determined by CO2-TPD measurement to elucidate the catalytic performance in the depolymerization of PS. It was found that basicity and catalytic performance (PS conversion, oil yield, and styrene monomer (SM) yield) showed volcano-shaped trends with respect to the Mg/Al ratio of Mgx-Aly-O catalysts. Correlations between basicity and catalytic performance revealed that all of PS conversion, oil yield, and SM yield were improved with the increasing basicity. Among the catalysts tested, the Mg1-Al2-O (Mg/Al = 0.5) catalyst with the largest basicity showed the best catalytic performance. Thus, basicity of Mgx-Aly-O catalyst played an important role in the determining the catalytic performance in depolymerization of PS.
