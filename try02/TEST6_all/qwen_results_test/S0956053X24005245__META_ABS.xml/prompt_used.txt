You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Monomer production from supercritical ethanol depolymerization of PET plastic waste using Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst Plastic waste poses a serious threat to the global environment, with recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic accounting for a considerable portion. The application of supercritical ethanol depolymerization technology presents an effective method for recycling PET waste. This study investigated using Ni as an additive to enhance the catalytic activity of ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for PET waste depolymerization. The effects of different catalysts, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and reaction time on PET waste depolymerization were studied using the single-factor controlled variable method. The results showed that the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 was the optimal catalyst, and under the optimal conditions with catalyst dosage of 4 %, reaction temperature of 260 °C, and reaction time of 60 min, the depolymerization efficiency of PET waste could reach 100 %, with the highest yields of diethyl terephthalate (DET) and ethylene glycol (EG) of 93.6 % and 90.2 %, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating conditions to obtain the highest monomer yields. The predicted optimal parameters from RSM were as follows: reaction temperature = 262.8 °C, reaction time = 63.2 min, catalyst dosage = 3.8 wt%, with the predicted highest DET and EG yields of 95.9 % and 90.7 %, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for DET and EG possessed the R2 values of 0.9921 and 0.9885, respectively, with p-values < 0.0001, indicating a good fit for the models. Furthermore, after five times reuse, the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst still exhibited good catalytic activity and stability. In conclusion, this study offers a clean, green, and sustainable alternative to recycling plastic waste.
