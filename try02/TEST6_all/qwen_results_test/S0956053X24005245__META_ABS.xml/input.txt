Monomer production from supercritical ethanol depolymerization of PET plastic waste using Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst Plastic waste poses a serious threat to the global environment, with recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic accounting for a considerable portion. The application of supercritical ethanol depolymerization technology presents an effective method for recycling PET waste. This study investigated using Ni as an additive to enhance the catalytic activity of ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for PET waste depolymerization. The effects of different catalysts, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and reaction time on PET waste depolymerization were studied using the single-factor controlled variable method. The results showed that the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 was the optimal catalyst, and under the optimal conditions with catalyst dosage of 4 %, reaction temperature of 260 °C, and reaction time of 60 min, the depolymerization efficiency of PET waste could reach 100 %, with the highest yields of diethyl terephthalate (DET) and ethylene glycol (EG) of 93.6 % and 90.2 %, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating conditions to obtain the highest monomer yields. The predicted optimal parameters from RSM were as follows: reaction temperature = 262.8 °C, reaction time = 63.2 min, catalyst dosage = 3.8 wt%, with the predicted highest DET and EG yields of 95.9 % and 90.7 %, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for DET and EG possessed the R2 values of 0.9921 and 0.9885, respectively, with p-values < 0.0001, indicating a good fit for the models. Furthermore, after five times reuse, the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst still exhibited good catalytic activity and stability. In conclusion, this study offers a clean, green, and sustainable alternative to recycling plastic waste.
