You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste: Chlorine distribution and formation of organic chlorinated compounds The release of chlorine during the pyrolysis of actual municipal plastic waste (MPW) was studied. Firstly, thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) was analyzed to investigate the chlorine release behavior. Then, the effect of temperature on chlorine migrations was investigated by fast pyrolysis experiments in a fixed bed reactor. Results showed that chlorine released mainly between 241 and 353 °C in the form of HCl or chloroesters during MPW pyrolysis. After pyrolysis, chlorine was mainly distributed in the pyrolytic gas (74.34–82.89 %) and char (10.17–21.29 %). However, the release of chlorine was inhibited due to the melting behavior of MPW at <350 °C. Besides, the relative contents and types of organic chlorinated compounds in liquid products were both decreased with temperature. It was observed that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the greatest contributor to the formation of organic chlorinated compounds during MPW pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the pyrolysis of PET was significantly promoted by the HCl released from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Subsequently, the pathways for the formation of organic chlorinated compounds through the co-pyrolysis of PVC and PET were proposed, including the initial degradation and subsequent chlorination of PET. These findings provided new insights into the release and regulation of chlorine-containing pollutants during actual MPW pyrolysis.
