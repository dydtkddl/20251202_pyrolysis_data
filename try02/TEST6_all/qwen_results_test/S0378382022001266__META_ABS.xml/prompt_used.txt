You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nitrogen trade-off during lignite chemical looping combustion using hematite as an oxygen carrier The chemical looping combustion (CLC) of coal has attracted signification attention due to low CO2 and NOx emissions. In this paper, the lignite CLC and hematite used as an oxygen carrier (OC) were investigated. The thermodynamic behavior of NH3/HCN (NOx precursors) and Fe2O3 (the main component of hematite) were analyzed. Under different OC masses, the release characteristics of NH3 and HCN with temperature were studied using TG-MS. Using a fixed bed reactor, the nitrogen trade-off in the fuel reactor was investigated as a function of OC mass, changing reaction temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and type of OC (modified by K/Na/Ca/Ni/Cu/Mn). Increasing the OC to lignite mass ratio led to a decrease of NH3 and HCN release. The release of HCN increased with the increasing temperature, while NH3 release decreased. An increased gas flow rate increased the emission of NH3 and HCN. Additionally, modifying the OC with Ni and Cu improved the oxidation performance and significantly reduced the emission of NH3 and HCN. To sum up, NH3 and HCN emission were lowest when the OC mass, temperature, and carrier gas flow rate were 10 g, 900 °C, and 50 mL/min, respectively, and OC-Ni or OC-Cu was the OC.
