You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing insights into phosphorus transformation during thermochemical treatment of sewage sludge This review examines the fate of phosphorus (P) during the thermochemical treatment of sewage sludge (SS). It begins with a brief discussion on P transformation during municipal wastewater treatment, affecting the distribution of P species in SS. Subsequently, a brief assessment of analytical methodologies for P characterization is presented, comparing established approaches while highlighting emerging tools that remain underutilized in this field. Thereafter, a comprehensive analysis of the influence of process parameters (such as temperature, retention time, reactor configuration, reactor atmosphere, and solid-to-liquid ratio) and feedstock characteristics (such as chemical composition, co-treatment with additives, particle size, and pH) on P transformation during incineration, pyrolysis, hydrothermal treatment, and gasification is presented. Assessment of multiple studies indicated that the operational temperature and the chemical composition of SS are the most critical factors influencing the fate of P. Generally, organic-P decomposes first, followed by pyrophosphate (whose relative fraction in ash/char peaks at ∼300–600oC), both of which convert to orthophosphate above 600oC. The apatite P/non-apatite inorganic P ratio in the ash/char increases with rising operational temperatures. Additives influence the metal/P molar ratio, thereby increasing the fraction of mineral P, with the effect depending on the specific type of additive used. P volatilization generally occurs at elevated temperatures, typically above 1100°C. However, SS with a high organic-P content may induce volatilization at temperatures below 1000°C. This understanding of P transformation is crucial for optimizing P recovery strategies from SS ash/char, with a broader goal of closing the anthropogenic P cycle along with SS treatment.
