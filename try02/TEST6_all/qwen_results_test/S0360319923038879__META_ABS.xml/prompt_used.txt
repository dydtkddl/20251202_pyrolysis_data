You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pd–Pt promoted HPMo/UiO-66 acid catalyst for n-hexane hydroisomerization for higher quality and cleaner fuel production: Catalytic activity and kinetic modeling The preparation of catalysts with adequate stability for the n-hexane hydroisomerization reaction is always a challenge in refineries. Therefore, in this work, the metal-organic framework UiO-66, heteropoly phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo), and bifunctional (Pd + Pt)/HPMo/UiO-66 samples were synthesized, characterized by experimental techniques, and tested in the n-hexane hydroisomerization reaction. As a result, the microporous (0.2%Pd+0.3%Pt)/30%HPMo/UiO-66 bifunctional catalyst exhibited an iso-hexane selectivity of 86% and n-hexane conversion of 72.1% after 36 h of reaction time. In addition, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was used to examine the kinetics of this reaction due to the inhibitory effect of hydrogen. The results provided an acceptable fit to the experimental data and allowed the determination of the kinetic parameters. Accordingly, the apparent activation energy of this bifunctional catalyst and the adsorption heats of hydrogen and n-hexane were calculated at 26.27, −16.12, and −7.82 kJ mol−1, respectively.
