Phycoremediation of wastewater and valorization of Chlorella homosphaera biomass for biodiesel, bio-oil and biochar production via in-situ transesterification and pyrolysis in a biorefinery framework This study presents a novel biorefinery approach to sustainable bioenergy production utilizing the microalga Chlorella homosphaera, aiming to exploit its biomass components fully. In the first phase, C. homosphaera was cultivated using tea processing industrial wastewater, achieving effective phycoremediation alongside biomass generation. The harvested biomass was processed for biodiesel production via an in situ transesterification technique. In the second phase, the residual biomass post-biodiesel extraction was subjected to pyrolysis at varying temperatures (400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C). The pyrolysis results demonstrated a maximum bio-oil yield of 35.39 wt% and a biochar yield of 64.44 wt%. Comprehensive analyses of the bio-oil using FTIR and GC-MS confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds, including esters, phenols, and acid derivatives. Fuel property assessments of both biodiesel and bio-oil, covering viscosity, density, calorific value, flash point, and pour point, indicated their suitability for stationary engine applications. Additionally, the biochar characterization revealed its potential as biocoal for industrial boilers, power plants, and cooking stoves. This integrated study underscores the potential of C. homosphaera as a sustainable feedstock for producing renewable fuels and value-added co-products, promoting a zero-waste, eco-friendly biorefinery model.
