You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

End-of-life wind turbine blades as a resource: A comparative study of pyrolysis and combustion The transition to a low-carbon economy has accelerated wind energy installations. However, managing waste wind turbine blades (WTBs) remains a challenge due to their composite nature and limited regulations. This study explores the thermochemical recovery of WTBs via pyrolysis and combustion, focusing on gaseous emissions, pyrolysis oil, pyrochar morphology and ash. WTBs exhibit low carbon content (29.5 wt%), a heating value of 12 MJ/kg, and high ash content (58 wt%), meeting the minimum fuel threshold for cement production but not EN 15359 standards. Pyrolysis tests revealed decomposition behavior (Tonset: 348 °C, Tpeak: 390 °C, Toffset:421 °C) with a 39.3 % conversion rate. TG-FTIR analysis identified alcohols, esters, phenolics, and carbonyl groups, with key volatiles released at 366–417 °C. Pyrolysis oil (C6-C40, dominated by C15) was rich in Bisphenol A derivatives, suitable for resin production. Pyrochar, primarily glass fiber, exhibited low carbon content, making it suitable as a concrete or polymer additive. Combustion tests showed a mean ignition temperature of 276 °C, burnout at 686.5 °C, and moderate combustibility index. CO2 emissions peaked between 421 and 572 °C. Ash morphology revealed glass fibers surrounded by loosely adherent ash. These findings support WTB valorization, promoting energy and material recovery while addressing environmental concerns.
