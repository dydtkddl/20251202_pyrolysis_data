Forgotten fibre waste: Mycoremediation and recycling of used absorbent hygiene products Beyond clothing, end-of-life technical textiles and nonwoven products are an additional source of fibre-based waste and environmental impact. Absorbent Hygiene Products (AHPs), i.e. single use, disposable diapers (nappies), adult incontinence and menstrual products, play an important role in supporting the personal hygiene and wellbeing of millions of people worldwide, but their disposal presents considerable waste management and environmental challenges due to their biological contamination, as well as mixed fibre and polymer composition. Despite high rates of consumption, used AHPs remain one of the hardest waste streams to recycle, and most are incinerated or landfilled. Internationally, very little used AHP recycling infrastructure exists, and generating high-value outputs from such waste is highly challenging, mainly due to its multifaceted nature. This review evaluates the potential for an alternative biotechnological approach to recycling based on mycoremediation and biocatalysis of used AHPs (containing cellulose, superabsorbent polymers and synthetic polymers) harnessing fungi to valorise the cellulosic and plastic components of the waste. We focus on the synergistic integration of mycoremediation and precision fermentation techniques as part of a biorefinery model to yield valuable material outputs from used AHPs, such as industrial chemicals and fibre-forming biodegradable polymers for industrial applications, as a basis for new circular economies.
