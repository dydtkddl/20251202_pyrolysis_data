You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effectiveness of CO2-mediated pyrolysis for the treatment of biodegradable plastics: A case study of polybutylene adipate terephthalate/polylactic acid mulch film Despite the widespread use of biodegradable mulch films, they are often unsuitable for disposal in open environments and cannot be recycled in the same manner as conventional plastics; hence, an effective disposal method needs to be suggested. Herein, pyrolysis of biodegradable mulch film made of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid (PLA) was considered. The pyrolysis of the PBAT/PLA mulch film in CO2 yielded more non-condensable gases than the pyrolysis in N2 due to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles at 800 °C. At higher than 600 °C in CO2, reverse water-gas shift reaction considerably increased CO selectivity. Using CO2 in the pyrolysis suppressed the generation of wax and char, attributed to CO2 enhancing not only thermal cleavage of pyrolytic volatiles released from the PBAT/PLA mulch film but also O–H and C–H bonds existing on the substance. The CO2 pyrolysis agent forwarded the cleavage of the polymeric bond of PBAT to produce more monomeric compounds (e.g., adipates and phthalates), while it suppressed radical reactions to produce less polycyclic compounds and phenyls. Rising temperature raised the gaseous pyrolyzate yield and lowered the char and wax yields. The use of CO2 agents in pyrolysis has a significant feature of upcycling biodegradable plastic wastes.
