You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Centimeter-scale gas-sieving nanoporous single-layer graphene membrane High-permeance, molecular-sieving, nanoporous single-layer graphene (NSLG) membranes are highly promising for gas separation. However, the formation of cracks during the transfer of NSLG to a low-cost porous support is difficult to avoid. These cracks are detrimental to gas selectivity, and therefore, make the scale-up of the gas-sieving NSLG membranes challenging. To mitigate the crack formation on low-cost macroporous supports, herein, we demonstrate mechanical reinforcement of the graphene film with a two-layer composite carbon film. The bottom layer of the composite film is a 100-nm-thick block-copolymer film derived nanoporous carbon (NPC) film with a pore size of 20–30 nm. This layer makes an intimate contact with NSLG and prevents generation of crack. However, the NPC film by itself is not robust enough to cover the rough surface of low-cost macroporous supports and tends to generate occasional cracks. This is prevented by spin-coating a 500-nm-thick multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) film, hosting pore size of 200–300 nm, on top of the NPC film. This imparts enough mechanical strength to NSLG/NPC film to be successfully suspended on a low-cost, macroporous, nonwoven metal wire mesh on a centimeter-scale while completely avoiding cracks. As a result, H2/CH4 and H2/CO2 selectivities of 11–23 and 5–8, respectively, higher than the corresponding Knudsen selectivities of 2.8 and 4.7, respectively, are obtained from the centimeter-scale NSLG membranes. The reinforced membranes are mechanically robust and can successfully withstand transmembrane pressure difference of 4 bar. When the MWNT film is directly coated on NSLG without using the intermediate NPC layer, the gas sieving behavior is not observed, likely due to the development of nanoscale cracks. This underlines the crucial role of the hierarchical pore structure in the composite carbon film in realizing the gas-sieving graphene membranes.
