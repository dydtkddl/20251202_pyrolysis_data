Recent advances in nanostructured cobalt oxide (Co3O4): Addressing methods and design strategies, challenges, and future directions for non-enzymatic sensor applications Rapid, accurate, and reliable determination of desired analytes is important in clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and environmental analysis. Spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is the potential electrocatalytic material for detecting a wide range of analytes. Due to their unique electrochemical properties, Co3O4 nanostructures are extensively utilized to develop non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors. Various methods have been employed to synthesize different types of Co3O4 nanostructures. These nanostructures have piqued interest in electrochemical sensors due to their abundant active sites for electrochemical processes, which enable easy adsorption and diffusion of electroactive species. Different shaped Co3O4 nanostructure and their composites have been prepared for electrochemical sensing. Several studies have used cobalt oxide-based non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors to detect various species like glucose, uric acid, hydrogen peroxide, ascorbic acid, drugs, heavy metal ions, and other species. Designing cobalt oxide nanostructures with excellent surface area is thus in demand for creating high-performance sensors. Therefore, the review highlights the viable methods used for the synthesis, morphological effects, and applications of Co3O4 in electrochemical sensing.
