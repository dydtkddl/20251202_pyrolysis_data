Chemical recycling of plastics using sub- and supercritical fluids The development of chemical recycling of waste plastics by decomposition reactions in sub- and supercritical fluids is reviewed. Decomposition reactions proceed rapidly and selectively using supercritical fluids compared to conventional processes. Condensation polymerization plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon, and polyurethane, are relatively easily depolymerized to their monomers in supercritical water or alcohols. The monomer components are recovered in high yield. Addition polymerization plastics such as phenol resin, epoxy resin, and polyethylene, are also decomposed to monomer components with or without catalysts. Pilot scale or commercial scale plants have been developed and are operating with sub- and supercritical fluids.
