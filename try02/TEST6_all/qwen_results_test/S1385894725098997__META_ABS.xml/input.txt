In-depth insight into the synergistic mechanism of in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and polystyrene with MgO MgO as an alkaline catalyst offers a more economical and activity-stable option for the pyrolysis of polymers. In the present work, it was used for the microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS), representing typical aliphatic and aromatic polymeric structures, respectively, to explore the interactions between plastics, which enhance the production of high-quality liquid fuel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was employed to assess the thermodynamic and kinetic features of the pyrolysis process. Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PS without a catalyst lowered the activation energy (E) by 75.0 kJ/mol, while the addition of MgO further decreased E by 46.6 kJ/mol. Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis experiments demonstrated that non-catalytic conditions favored liquid fuel formation while suppressing gas production. With the addition of MgO, liquid yield dropped while gas yield rose. The catalytic co-pyrolysis elevated the content of C5−C12 hydrocarbons and monoaromatic hydrocarbons, with positive synergistic effect of 30.5% and 159.5%, respectively. Notably, at an LDPE/PS ratio of 1:2, the content of C5−C12 hydrocarbons reached 100%, with monoaromatic hydrocarbons accounting for 95.6%. Gas product analysis demonstrated that hydrogen production was boosted by the catalytic co-pyrolysis, with the highest proportion of 26.7 vol% in the total gas product. MgO after the reaction was characterized using various techniques, which indicated a decline in specific surface area of the catalyst, associated with the deposition of high-boiling aromatic compounds during co-pyrolysis. Several model hydrocarbon compounds were selected for the catalytic reaction using in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), facilitating the analysis of the conversion mechanism.
