You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-depth insight into the synergistic mechanism of in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and polystyrene with MgO MgO as an alkaline catalyst offers a more economical and activity-stable option for the pyrolysis of polymers. In the present work, it was used for the microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS), representing typical aliphatic and aromatic polymeric structures, respectively, to explore the interactions between plastics, which enhance the production of high-quality liquid fuel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was employed to assess the thermodynamic and kinetic features of the pyrolysis process. Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PS without a catalyst lowered the activation energy (E) by 75.0 kJ/mol, while the addition of MgO further decreased E by 46.6 kJ/mol. Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis experiments demonstrated that non-catalytic conditions favored liquid fuel formation while suppressing gas production. With the addition of MgO, liquid yield dropped while gas yield rose. The catalytic co-pyrolysis elevated the content of C5−C12 hydrocarbons and monoaromatic hydrocarbons, with positive synergistic effect of 30.5% and 159.5%, respectively. Notably, at an LDPE/PS ratio of 1:2, the content of C5−C12 hydrocarbons reached 100%, with monoaromatic hydrocarbons accounting for 95.6%. Gas product analysis demonstrated that hydrogen production was boosted by the catalytic co-pyrolysis, with the highest proportion of 26.7 vol% in the total gas product. MgO after the reaction was characterized using various techniques, which indicated a decline in specific surface area of the catalyst, associated with the deposition of high-boiling aromatic compounds during co-pyrolysis. Several model hydrocarbon compounds were selected for the catalytic reaction using in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), facilitating the analysis of the conversion mechanism.
