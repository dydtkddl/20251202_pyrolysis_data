You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling pyrolyzed organic waste from plant nurseries, rice production and shrimp industry as peat substitute in potting substrates Organic waste from greens of tomato plants, gardening substrate, rice husks and shrimp-derived chitin were pyrolyzed at 400 °C and 500 °C for 3 h, with the aim to elucidate the feasibility of using such products as replacement of peat in soilless gardening substrates. Characterization of the carbonized organic matter (COM) and the gardening substrate indicated that neither the peat nor the COMs provided the recommended levels of nutrients for the cultivation of tomato plants, although improvements could be obtained using COM/substrate mixtures. The toxicity thresholds for Zn were exceeded significantly by the COMs of the tomato greens and high boron levels were found for all the COMs except for those derived from chitin. In a 40-days pot experiment, germination and development of tomato seeds and plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were tested on COM/peat mixtures at 30%, 60% and 100% COM substitution rate. The lack of seed germination on the mixtures with COM from tomato greens is best explained with the high salinity of the COM. Best plant growth was obtained with COM from chitin at 60%, most likely because its high N content satisfied best the N-needs of the growing tomato plants without increasing the pH of the growing media. Moreover, an increase of water retention was evidenced for COM/substrate mixtures. Although the use of COM from chitin and rice husks showed promising results, the proposed recycling of organic waste from agriculture or fishery as soilless gardening substrate requires the development of formulations of COM/peat/and added nutrients with ready-to-use characteristics to increase its feasibility.
