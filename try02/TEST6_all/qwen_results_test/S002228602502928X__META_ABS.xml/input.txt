Advanced functional spinel ferrite based nanomaterials for targeted wastewater treatment Industrial wastewater is damaging to environment since it is poisonous and does not break down. Spinel ferrites (SFs) have become attractive materials for cleaning up wastewater because of their large surface area, stability, adjustable bandgaps and ability to be recover magnetically. This article goes into great detail about how spinel ferrites may be used to clean up industrial waste, focussing on how they are made, their structural features, and how they break down dyes through photocatalysis. Key results show that spinel ferrites work very well, e.g. cobalt-magnesium ferrite can break up the pollutants like methylene blue up to 99.5 % and also ferrites like manganese zinc can degrade methyl dye up to 97 % under suitable condition. Adding transition or rare-earth metals and making composites increases charge separation and photocatalytic (PC) efficiency. We take a close look at how pH, temperature, light intensity and catalyst dosage effect the removal of dyes. Even if they have certain benefits, problems like aggregation, scalability, and performance in practical wastewater systems still exist. This study shows that spinel ferrites could be used as photocatalysts (PCs) that are both sustainable and recyclable. It also points out areas for future research, such as bandgap engineering and reactor design optimisation, that could help make the jump from successful lab experiments to real-world use for effective water purification.
