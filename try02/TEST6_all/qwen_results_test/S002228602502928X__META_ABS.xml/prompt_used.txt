You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced functional spinel ferrite based nanomaterials for targeted wastewater treatment Industrial wastewater is damaging to environment since it is poisonous and does not break down. Spinel ferrites (SFs) have become attractive materials for cleaning up wastewater because of their large surface area, stability, adjustable bandgaps and ability to be recover magnetically. This article goes into great detail about how spinel ferrites may be used to clean up industrial waste, focussing on how they are made, their structural features, and how they break down dyes through photocatalysis. Key results show that spinel ferrites work very well, e.g. cobalt-magnesium ferrite can break up the pollutants like methylene blue up to 99.5 % and also ferrites like manganese zinc can degrade methyl dye up to 97 % under suitable condition. Adding transition or rare-earth metals and making composites increases charge separation and photocatalytic (PC) efficiency. We take a close look at how pH, temperature, light intensity and catalyst dosage effect the removal of dyes. Even if they have certain benefits, problems like aggregation, scalability, and performance in practical wastewater systems still exist. This study shows that spinel ferrites could be used as photocatalysts (PCs) that are both sustainable and recyclable. It also points out areas for future research, such as bandgap engineering and reactor design optimisation, that could help make the jump from successful lab experiments to real-world use for effective water purification.
