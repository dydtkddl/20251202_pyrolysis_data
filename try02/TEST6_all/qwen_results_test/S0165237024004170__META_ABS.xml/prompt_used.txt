You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis between Naomaohu coal and waste plastics Understanding the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis between coal and different plastics is very important to reveal the matching between coal and waste plastics, and the influence of plastics with different structures and properties on the synergistic effect can be recognized based on the composition and distribution of co-pyrolysis products. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of low-rank Naomaohu coal (NMH) with thermoplastic polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin (PF) were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis between NMH with different plastics. The results showed that the product distribution of NMH co-pyrolysis with different thermoplastics are similar, showing the highest tar yield, while co-pyrolysis with thermoset PF showed the highest solid yield. The addition of PE and PF to NMH had a positive synergistic effect on the tar yield, with an added value of 3.2 wt% and 2.9 wt%, respectively, which was related to the large overlap interval of the weight-loss temperatures of NMH with PE and PF as exhibited by the TG results. In addition, the co-pyrolysis of NMH with polyolefin plastics PE and PP increased the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons such as alkanes and alkenes in the tar, while the co-pyrolysis with polyaromatic plastics PS and PF significantly increased the aromatic compounds such as aromatics and phenols of the tar. Therefore, suitable plastics can be selected for co-pyrolysis with coal to improve tar yield and tar quality.
