You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of waste biomass and waste plastics (polystyrene and waste nitrile gloves) into renewable fuel and value-added chemicals The present study addresses the influence of blending of waste plastics (i.e., polystyrene, PS and waste nitrile gloves, WNG) with mahua seeds (MH) for co-pyrolytic liquid yield and its fuel properties. Various blends of waste plastics were mixed with biomass (10, 20 and 30 wt%) and pyrolyzed in a semi-batch reactor at an optimized environment (550 °C temperature, 80 °C min−1 heating rate, and 100 mL min−1 N2 flow rate). Physicochemical results displayed its ability to yield renewable fuel and valuable chemicals. Co-pyrolysis outcomes showed that blending of waste plastics at 20 wt%, yielded maximum liquid (44.18 ± 1.2 wt% and 45.89 ± 1.4 wt% for MH + WNG and MH + PS respectively) which was higher than thermal pyrolysis of individual MH (39.26 ± 1.2 wt%). Further, characterization results revealed a substantial reduction in viscosity, oxygen content, moisture, and a positive increment in gross heating value, carbon content and acidity. FTIR examination exposed the attendance of mainly aromatics, acids, phenols, water, esters and ethers. Further, NMR analysis of pyrolytic oil confirmed an increase in aromaticity by blending of waste plastics (20 wt%) while there was a reduction in paraffinic compounds. GC–MS investigation revealed substantial improvement in hydrocarbons and minimization in the oxygen-rich products by blending of waste plastics at 20 wt%.
