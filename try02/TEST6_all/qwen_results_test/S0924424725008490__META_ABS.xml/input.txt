Molecularly imprinted polymers in soft and flexible surfaces for biomedical applications The integration of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with soft and flexible substrates represents a promising yet underexplored approach in the field of wearable and implantable biosensors. While MIPs offer high chemical stability and selective molecular recognition akin to biological receptors, soft materials enable real-time, conformal sensing in dynamic and complex environments. This review critically examines recent advances in MIP fabrication and deposition strategies, as well as the development of flexible substrates, including polymers, textiles, paper, and bio-derived materials. Emphasis is placed on methods that merge imprinting with stretchable, biocompatible, and multifunctional materials for biomedical monitoring. Particular attention is paid to the challenges in imprinting large biomolecules and achieving scalable, durable sensor designs. By highlighting both achievements and current limitations, this work provides a roadmap for the design of next-generation wearable biosensors that integrate smart recognition with adaptable mechanical performance.
