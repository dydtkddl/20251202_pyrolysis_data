You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plasma polymerization mediated construction of surface ion-imprinted polypropylene fibers for the selective adsorption of Cr(VI) This work reports the preparation of a surface ion-imprinted polymer (IIP) using polypropylene (PP) fibers as substrates for the selective adsorption of Cr(VI). Glycidyl methacrylate was firstly grafted onto PP fibers through a plasma polymerization-induced process, followed by the construction of imprinted sites. The resultant sorbent was characterized using SEM, FT-IR, TGA, XPS, and water contact angle. The results of batch adsorption experiments showed that the maximum Cr(VI) adsorption capacity was 103 mg/g at pH 3 and 25 °C. The Cr(VI) adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order rate model, and the equilibrium data were best described by a Langmuir isotherm model. Meanwhile, the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic. IIP showed a high adsorption selectivity for Cr(VI) in binary systems with Cr3+, Cu2+, and SO4 2−, respectively, compared with that of non-imprinted fibers. The removal mechanism of Cr(VI) was investigated combining with FT-IR and XPS analysis, and the results suggested that chemical adsorption occurred between the functional groups on IIP and Cr(VI), as did the partial transformation of Cr(VI) to Cr3+. The results demonstrated that the prepared material is a good candidate for selective Cr(VI) adsorption in practical use.
