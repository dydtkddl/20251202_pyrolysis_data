Sustainable green technology integrated hydrogen production system for low carbon future Utilising hydrogen (H2) as a clean and sustainable energy source has great potential to address the world’s energy needs. This study thoroughly analyses the technology for sustainably producing H2, which emphasises the integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar-integrated, geothermal-integrated, and other green technology-integrated H2 systems. The solar-integrated H2 system includes a range of techniques, including solar biomass gasification, solar thermal water-splitting, photocatalytic methods, photo electrolysis method, solar photovoltaic cells, and photobiological processes for H2 production, each with specific benefits and drawbacks. This study also explores geothermal integrated H2 systems, looking for geothermal energy that may be used to produce H2. A comprehensive overview of the diverse scenario of sustainable H2 production is also provided. Finally, this study addresses the perspectives and challenges related to sustainable hydrogen generation systems. Integrated H2 production systems have the potential to overcome current obstacles and attain their maximum potential in achieving a low-carbon future.
