An experimental and kinetic modeling study of cyclopentadiene pyrolysis: First growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons The importance of 1,3-cyclopentadiene (CPD) and cyclopentadienyl (CPDyl) moieties in the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was studied using new experimental data and ab initio calculations. The experimental investigation was performed in a tubular continuous flow pyrolysis reactor under both high ( 24 mol N 2 / mol CPD ) and low ( 5 mol N 2 / mol CPD ) nitrogen dilutions, covering a temperature range of 873–1123K, at a fixed pressure of 1.7bara. At the most severe conditions up to 84% of CPD is converted, and the amount of PAHs is more than 65wt%. Major products observed during CPD pyrolysis were benzene, indene, methyl-indenes and naphthalene, in line with previous studies. On-line GC×GC-FID/(TOF-MS) also allowed to quantify minor species (methane, toluene, styrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc.), never reported before at this level of accuracy. The new experimental data have been used to further analyze the role of the successive interactions of CPD, indene, and naphthalene as well as the recombination and addition reactions of their resonantly stabilized radicals and refine their kinetics. The results of the modeling study are in good agreement with existing and new experimental observations.
