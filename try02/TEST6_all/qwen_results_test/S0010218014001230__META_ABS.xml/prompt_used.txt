You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An experimental and kinetic modeling study of cyclopentadiene pyrolysis: First growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons The importance of 1,3-cyclopentadiene (CPD) and cyclopentadienyl (CPDyl) moieties in the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was studied using new experimental data and ab initio calculations. The experimental investigation was performed in a tubular continuous flow pyrolysis reactor under both high ( 24 mol N 2 / mol CPD ) and low ( 5 mol N 2 / mol CPD ) nitrogen dilutions, covering a temperature range of 873–1123K, at a fixed pressure of 1.7bara. At the most severe conditions up to 84% of CPD is converted, and the amount of PAHs is more than 65wt%. Major products observed during CPD pyrolysis were benzene, indene, methyl-indenes and naphthalene, in line with previous studies. On-line GC×GC-FID/(TOF-MS) also allowed to quantify minor species (methane, toluene, styrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc.), never reported before at this level of accuracy. The new experimental data have been used to further analyze the role of the successive interactions of CPD, indene, and naphthalene as well as the recombination and addition reactions of their resonantly stabilized radicals and refine their kinetics. The results of the modeling study are in good agreement with existing and new experimental observations.
