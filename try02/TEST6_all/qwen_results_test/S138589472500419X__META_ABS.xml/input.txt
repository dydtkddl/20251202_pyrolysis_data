Selection and applications of electrocatalysts for electrochemical anodizing oxidation of emerging contaminants in water: A review Electrochemical anodizing oxidation (EAO) is an effective way of degrading pollutants into oligomers and diminutive molecules. Despite a fraction of the electrical energy lost in the manner of thermal energy, electrochemistry via exerting voltage bypasses disparate reactions that hardly can be achieved by traditional stoichiometric chemical reactions. This technology can decompose and transform difficult-to-biodegrade contaminants by utilizing clean energy. The design and purpose of electrocatalysts must be the main activity source of electrochemical reactions, which can operate electrochemical systems specifically. Thus, this review provides an overview of the efficient strategies for EAO of emerging contaminants (ECs) (such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and microplastics (MPs)) in recent years, while briefly discussing the motivation and development focusing on the reaction mechanism of electrocatalysts in the degradation process and emphasized the innovative means to stability and activity of the material structure. Finally, it also puts forward a point of view about the development and application of reasonable durability for electric catalyst research, which contributes to the large-scale application of EAO technology for pollutant removal.
