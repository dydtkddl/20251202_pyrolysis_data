You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selection and applications of electrocatalysts for electrochemical anodizing oxidation of emerging contaminants in water: A review Electrochemical anodizing oxidation (EAO) is an effective way of degrading pollutants into oligomers and diminutive molecules. Despite a fraction of the electrical energy lost in the manner of thermal energy, electrochemistry via exerting voltage bypasses disparate reactions that hardly can be achieved by traditional stoichiometric chemical reactions. This technology can decompose and transform difficult-to-biodegrade contaminants by utilizing clean energy. The design and purpose of electrocatalysts must be the main activity source of electrochemical reactions, which can operate electrochemical systems specifically. Thus, this review provides an overview of the efficient strategies for EAO of emerging contaminants (ECs) (such as antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and microplastics (MPs)) in recent years, while briefly discussing the motivation and development focusing on the reaction mechanism of electrocatalysts in the degradation process and emphasized the innovative means to stability and activity of the material structure. Finally, it also puts forward a point of view about the development and application of reasonable durability for electric catalyst research, which contributes to the large-scale application of EAO technology for pollutant removal.
