A comprehensive review on the intricate processes involved in algae pyrolysis mechanism and possible migration of undesirable chemical elements In recent times, algae have been potentially emerged as a viable third generation feedstock for biofuels due to its renewable, environmentally friendly and sustainable characteristics. Pyrolysis, as a promising thermochemical conversion method, has been extensively researched, yet the complex processes involved in the mechanism of algal pyrolysis have not been fully explored. The complex composition and structure of algae, primarily consisting of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and various inorganic elements, are known to add diversity and complexity to the pyrolysis process. These components have been found to significantly impact the pyrolysis process and may lead to environmental hazards. In this paper, bibliometric analysis is employed to comprehensively review and analyze contemporary research articles focused on algae pyrolysis. The mechanisms involved in the pyrolysis of primary constituents of algae, such as nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and other elements, are investigated, with their intricate interrelationships and the migration and transformation mechanisms throughout the pyrolysis process being elucidated. Additionally, key strategies for recovering and eliminating undesirable heteroatoms from the by-products of algae pyrolysis are explored and analyzed. This comprehensive review of the pyrolysis of algae is provided, contributing necessary insights for enhancing product selectivity, minimizing environmental consequences, and acting as a tool for further extensive exploration in this crucial field.
