You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on the intricate processes involved in algae pyrolysis mechanism and possible migration of undesirable chemical elements In recent times, algae have been potentially emerged as a viable third generation feedstock for biofuels due to its renewable, environmentally friendly and sustainable characteristics. Pyrolysis, as a promising thermochemical conversion method, has been extensively researched, yet the complex processes involved in the mechanism of algal pyrolysis have not been fully explored. The complex composition and structure of algae, primarily consisting of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and various inorganic elements, are known to add diversity and complexity to the pyrolysis process. These components have been found to significantly impact the pyrolysis process and may lead to environmental hazards. In this paper, bibliometric analysis is employed to comprehensively review and analyze contemporary research articles focused on algae pyrolysis. The mechanisms involved in the pyrolysis of primary constituents of algae, such as nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and other elements, are investigated, with their intricate interrelationships and the migration and transformation mechanisms throughout the pyrolysis process being elucidated. Additionally, key strategies for recovering and eliminating undesirable heteroatoms from the by-products of algae pyrolysis are explored and analyzed. This comprehensive review of the pyrolysis of algae is provided, contributing necessary insights for enhancing product selectivity, minimizing environmental consequences, and acting as a tool for further extensive exploration in this crucial field.
