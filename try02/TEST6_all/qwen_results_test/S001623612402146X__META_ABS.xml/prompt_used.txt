You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-temperature glucose foaming to construct three-dimensionally porous bulk CoMo catalyst for thiophene hydrodesulfurization The textural properties and existing state of active sites of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts would significantly influence their performance. In this study, three-dimensionally porous (3DP) bulk CoMo catalysts were fabricated via the controllable nitrate-induced low-temperature glucose foaming process. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to investigate the decomposition and carbonization processes of forming intermediate. It was found that catalyst calcination under an air atmosphere prevented the transformation of MO3 into MO2, which facilitated the production of active MoS2 in the sulfurization process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), low-temperature N2 adsorption–desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the prepared 3DP catalysts. The characterization results indicated that the prepared catalysts possessed the unique 3DP structure with abundant mesopores and macropores, promoting the diffusion of the reactant and product during the HDS reaction. The bulk CoMo-1:2 catalyst achieved the thiophene conversion of 91.6 % at 360 °C and 1 MPa, which was attributed to the high MoS2 dispersion degree and Mo4+ fraction. This study demonstrates the broad application prospects of using glucose as the sacrificial template to construct 3DP structures in catalyst preparation.
