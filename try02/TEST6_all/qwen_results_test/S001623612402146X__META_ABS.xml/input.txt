Low-temperature glucose foaming to construct three-dimensionally porous bulk CoMo catalyst for thiophene hydrodesulfurization The textural properties and existing state of active sites of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts would significantly influence their performance. In this study, three-dimensionally porous (3DP) bulk CoMo catalysts were fabricated via the controllable nitrate-induced low-temperature glucose foaming process. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were employed to investigate the decomposition and carbonization processes of forming intermediate. It was found that catalyst calcination under an air atmosphere prevented the transformation of MO3 into MO2, which facilitated the production of active MoS2 in the sulfurization process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), low-temperature N2 adsorption–desorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the prepared 3DP catalysts. The characterization results indicated that the prepared catalysts possessed the unique 3DP structure with abundant mesopores and macropores, promoting the diffusion of the reactant and product during the HDS reaction. The bulk CoMo-1:2 catalyst achieved the thiophene conversion of 91.6 % at 360 °C and 1 MPa, which was attributed to the high MoS2 dispersion degree and Mo4+ fraction. This study demonstrates the broad application prospects of using glucose as the sacrificial template to construct 3DP structures in catalyst preparation.
