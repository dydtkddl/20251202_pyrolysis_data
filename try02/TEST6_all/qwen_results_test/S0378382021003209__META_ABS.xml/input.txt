Effects of interactions between organic solid waste components on the formation of heavy components in oil during pyrolysis This study focused on the interaction between organic solid waste (OSW) components on the formation and chemical composition of heavy components (>150 m/z) in OSW-oil. Rice husk (RH) and polypropylene (PP) as typical biomass and plastic fractions in OSW, were co-pyrolyzed at different blend ratios and different temperatures. The heavy components were characterized by FT-ICR MS, UV-F and GC MS. The results indicated that the yield of heavy components in PP-oil was higher than in RH-oil under the same temperature. Heavy hydrocarbons were found in PP-oil, while heavy phenols and heavy lipids existed in RH-oil. Significant interactions occurred at high temperatures (>600 °C). The interactions promoted the heavy components in all the blend-oils, corresponding to an increase of 20–35% compared to the calculated value of the content in PP-oil and RH-oil. At low PP ratio (25PP + 75RH), PP provided hydrogen to the reactive O-containing species in RH, leading to promoted heavy phenols and heavy lipids. At high PP ratio (50PP + 50RH and 75PP + 25RH), large aromatics (>3 rings) increased of 48–111% with respect to the calculated values. Plenty of PP‑hydrogen and a rich oxygen environment provided by RH radicals enhanced the formation of heavy aromatics and heavy PAH.
