You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of interactions between organic solid waste components on the formation of heavy components in oil during pyrolysis This study focused on the interaction between organic solid waste (OSW) components on the formation and chemical composition of heavy components (>150 m/z) in OSW-oil. Rice husk (RH) and polypropylene (PP) as typical biomass and plastic fractions in OSW, were co-pyrolyzed at different blend ratios and different temperatures. The heavy components were characterized by FT-ICR MS, UV-F and GC MS. The results indicated that the yield of heavy components in PP-oil was higher than in RH-oil under the same temperature. Heavy hydrocarbons were found in PP-oil, while heavy phenols and heavy lipids existed in RH-oil. Significant interactions occurred at high temperatures (>600 °C). The interactions promoted the heavy components in all the blend-oils, corresponding to an increase of 20–35% compared to the calculated value of the content in PP-oil and RH-oil. At low PP ratio (25PP + 75RH), PP provided hydrogen to the reactive O-containing species in RH, leading to promoted heavy phenols and heavy lipids. At high PP ratio (50PP + 50RH and 75PP + 25RH), large aromatics (>3 rings) increased of 48–111% with respect to the calculated values. Plenty of PP‑hydrogen and a rich oxygen environment provided by RH radicals enhanced the formation of heavy aromatics and heavy PAH.
