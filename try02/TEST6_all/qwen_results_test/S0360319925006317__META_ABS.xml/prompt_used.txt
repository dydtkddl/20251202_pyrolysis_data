You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress and challenges in nanostructured carbon-based hydrogen sensor Hydrogen, with the highest gravimetric energy density, is recognized as one of the most promising alternatives to rapidly depleting fossil fuels. However, high flammability and undetectability due to odor and color-less characteristics pose a severe threat to its safe use. Thus, the efficient monitoring of hydrogen becomes essential, starting from its generation/storage sites, transportation, and even hydrogen-fuel vehicles. It relies on developing efficient hydrogen sensing materials capable of sensing even ultra-low concentrations. Carbon nanomaterials are the materials of choice because of their tuneable physical/chemical and electronic properties by controlling the surface morphologies/modifications of their various allotropes, making them the ideal platform for efficient hydrogen detection. Considering the continuously growing demand for hydrogen and its uses, this article presents recent developments in carbon nanomaterials such as single/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (S/M-WCNT), graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for hydrogen sensor. The 3S (i.e., sensitivity, selectivity, and stability) sensor parameters are discussed for these materials in conjunction with respective response/recovery times. Further, the article emphasizes possible hydrogen sensing mechanisms, which will assist in designing room temperature hydrogen sensors with enhanced sensitivity even at parts per billion (ppb) level and fast response and recovery times. Thus, this article will be helpful for both researchers and industrialists working on hydrogen sensors to mitigate the safety issues of the ever-growing hydrogen energy sector.
