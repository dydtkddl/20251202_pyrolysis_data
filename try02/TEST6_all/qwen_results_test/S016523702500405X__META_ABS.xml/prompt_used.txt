You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of co-pyrolysis temperature on the characteristics of diesel-like fuel produced from waste frying and engine oils Global warming and energy crisis have driven the attention of researchers towards conversion of waste materials into valuable products. As compared to the simple pyrolysis, the co-pyrolysis is an environmentally friendly and effective waste conversion process which enhances the yield and properties of the co-pyrolytic fuel. This study explored the effect of temperature (380–450°C, with 10°C difference) on the yield and properties of the co-pyrolytic oil produced from waste frying oil and waste engine oil mixture with 1:1 ratio by volume. The influence of co-pyrolysis temperature on the fractions and properties of the distillate oil within the boiling range of diesel was also analyzed, which was obtained by ASTM D86 distillation of the co-pyrolytic oil. This co-pyrolysis study was conducted in a stainless-steel semi-batch reactor of 1.856-liters capacity. Most of the samples showed that physiochemical properties resembled to that of the commercial diesel, particularly at temperatures above 420°C. Product fuel was characterized by testing commercially important physiochemical properties including pour point, cetane index, API gravity, kinematic viscosity, calorific value, sulfur content and flash point by using test methods set by ASTM standards. Properties of the product fuel were compared to that of the standard specifications for diesel and biodiesel set by ASTM. The highest yield of co-pyrolytic oil (80.1 wt%) and highest fraction of distillate oil (85 vol%) were obtained at 450°C. By comparing with diesel and biodiesel, co-pyrolytic and distillate oils obtained at 450°C showed physiochemical properties resembling closely to the commercial diesel.
