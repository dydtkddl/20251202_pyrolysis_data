You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Personal exposure to microplastics and PAHs in PM2.5: Personal vs. outdoor assessment and health risks Microplastics (MPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are pervasive emerging pollutants in the environment, raising growing concerns about their adverse health effects. However, research on characterizing MPs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remains scarce due to methodological challenges. This study quantified human exposure to MPs and PAHs in PM2.5 in Shanghai, a megacity in China, using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and GC/MS, respectively. The average concentration of personal exposure MPs reached 2.27 ± 2.31 μg m−3, which appeared to be higher than outdoor levels (0.69 ± 0.58 μg m−3). Polyethylene (PE) was the dominant polymer in both environments, with personal exposure samples exhibiting higher proportions of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS). Relative humidity had a significant impact on outdoor MP concentrations, whereas personal exposure MP levels were primarily affected by indoor sources and ventilation conditions. In contrast, the average concentration of outdoor PAHs (45.76 ± 35.02 ng m−3) was 50 % higher than the personal one (30.67 ± 8.67 ng m−3). A significant positive correlation between polypropylene (PP) and low-molecular-weight PAHs suggests potential adsorption or common sources. Estimated daily intake (EDI) assessment revealed higher exposure levels to MPs than PAHs, underscoring the urgent need for an in-depth understanding of inhalable MPs/NPs and their additives.
