You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis, characterization, and application of MIL-101(Cr) derived from waste PET bottles for CO2 conversion to propylene carbonate The synthesis, characterization, and application of MIL-101(Cr) derived from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for CO2 conversion into propylene carbonate (PC) were investigated. PET waste was depolymerized via alkaline hydrolysis to obtain terephthalic acid (BDC), which was used to synthesize MIL-101(Cr)-BDC catalysts. Non-hydrothermal synthesis using 5 M H2SO4 was more efficient than hydrothermal synthesis. Fourier transform–infrared (FT-IR), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analyses of the catalysts confirmed that self-synthesized BDC could replace commercial BDC without affecting the structural integrity of MIL-101(Cr). MIL-101(Cr)-BDC (PET) had a higher surface area and micropore ratio than MIL-101(Cr)-BDC. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis revealed that MIL-101(Cr)-BDC (PET) had a higher acidic site density (13.53 mmol/g) than MIL-101(Cr)-BDC (11.72 mmol/g) and enhanced catalytic reactivity. The optimal conditions for CO2 cycloaddition reaction with propylene oxide (PO) for CO2 conversion were a catalyst amount of 50 mg, CO2 pressure of 6 bar, and temperature of 60 °C, which resulted in a PO conversion rate of 93.77 %, PC selectivity of 96.50 %, and PC yield of 90.49 % after 24 h. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses showed that the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 15.47 kJ/mol and was exothermic and spontaneous at lower temperatures. An assessment of the economic feasibility of a 10-TPD plant indicated that the plant would break even and generate profit after 6.06 years. The study results demonstrate the potential for high catalytic performance and economic viability of MIL-101(Cr)-based catalyst synthesis for CO2 conversion using PET waste.
