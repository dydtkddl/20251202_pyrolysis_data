Synthesis, characterization, and application of MIL-101(Cr) derived from waste PET bottles for CO2 conversion to propylene carbonate The synthesis, characterization, and application of MIL-101(Cr) derived from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles for CO2 conversion into propylene carbonate (PC) were investigated. PET waste was depolymerized via alkaline hydrolysis to obtain terephthalic acid (BDC), which was used to synthesize MIL-101(Cr)-BDC catalysts. Non-hydrothermal synthesis using 5 M H2SO4 was more efficient than hydrothermal synthesis. Fourier transform–infrared (FT-IR), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analyses of the catalysts confirmed that self-synthesized BDC could replace commercial BDC without affecting the structural integrity of MIL-101(Cr). MIL-101(Cr)-BDC (PET) had a higher surface area and micropore ratio than MIL-101(Cr)-BDC. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis revealed that MIL-101(Cr)-BDC (PET) had a higher acidic site density (13.53 mmol/g) than MIL-101(Cr)-BDC (11.72 mmol/g) and enhanced catalytic reactivity. The optimal conditions for CO2 cycloaddition reaction with propylene oxide (PO) for CO2 conversion were a catalyst amount of 50 mg, CO2 pressure of 6 bar, and temperature of 60 °C, which resulted in a PO conversion rate of 93.77 %, PC selectivity of 96.50 %, and PC yield of 90.49 % after 24 h. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses showed that the reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 15.47 kJ/mol and was exothermic and spontaneous at lower temperatures. An assessment of the economic feasibility of a 10-TPD plant indicated that the plant would break even and generate profit after 6.06 years. The study results demonstrate the potential for high catalytic performance and economic viability of MIL-101(Cr)-based catalyst synthesis for CO2 conversion using PET waste.
