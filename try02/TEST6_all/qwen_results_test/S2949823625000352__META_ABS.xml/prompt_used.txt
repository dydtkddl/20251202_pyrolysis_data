You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of waste plastic pyrolysis: Synergistic effects and sustainability perspectives In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), waste mixed plastics (WMPs) and WMPs with spent fluid catalytic cracking (sFCC) catalyst (WMPs/ sFCC) were investigated to simulate real-life pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was performed under different heating rates i.e., 5, 10, 15 and 20 ˚C/min) in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The pyrolysis kinetics are assessed using three model-free methods, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), and Starink, as well as two model-fitting methods, Coats–Redfern (CR) and Criado methods (master plots). The results showed that the WMPs exhibited a positive synergetic effect among the different types of plastics, leading to a notable reduction in degradation temperature and required activation energy. Moreover, adding sFCC catalysts significantly lowered the initial pyrolysis temperature (approximately 47 ˚C) of WMPs compared to direct pyrolysis. Moreover, the average activation energy of WMPs decreased by approximately 13.41 kJ/mole with the inclusion of the sFCC catalyst. The thermodynamic properties such ΔH ‡ , ΔG ‡ and ΔS ‡ suggested that the process was endothermic, non-spontaneous and decreased in randomness during pyrolysis. This study promotes sustainability through a circular economy to convert waste into wealth. These findings offer valuable theoretical insights for reducing energy consumption in plastic pyrolysis and expanding the applications of sFCC catalyst.
