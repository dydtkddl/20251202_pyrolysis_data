You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Corrosion of metals by acetic acid: Mechanistic insights, industrial implications, and remediation approaches Acetic acid (CH3COOH), an organic acid, with a pK a value of 4.76, is considered a weak acid. However, hardly any industry has been found to be safe from acetic acid corrosion. This review article highlights some acetic acid corrosion problems in real-world applications. The interplay between influencing factors – pH, temperature, pressure, dissolved oxygen – has been discussed in detail. Mechanistic insights into the corrosion of various steels, alloys, and pure metals have been provided. A remarkable phenomenon known as the ‘buffering effect’ makes acetic acid more corrosive than mineral acids at similar pH levels has been well explained. Acetic acid corrosion mitigation strategies, including corrosion inhibitors, coatings, and surface treatments, have been thoroughly discussed and analyzed. This review is the first of its kind to discuss acetic acid corrosion, from its occurrence to its progression and mitigation. Ultimately, this review identified several research gaps, prompting corrosion scientists to take necessary measures to address acetic acid corrosion more effectively. This review provides a valuable foundation for deeper investigations into acetic acid-induced corrosion, a challenge anticipated to persist as a critical concern across various industrial sectors. Further research is needed to enhance the long-term durability of materials exposed to corrosive conditions and to develop more effective mitigation strategies.
