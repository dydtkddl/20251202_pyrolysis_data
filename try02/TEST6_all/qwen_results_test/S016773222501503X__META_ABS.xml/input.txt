Corrosion of metals by acetic acid: Mechanistic insights, industrial implications, and remediation approaches Acetic acid (CH3COOH), an organic acid, with a pK a value of 4.76, is considered a weak acid. However, hardly any industry has been found to be safe from acetic acid corrosion. This review article highlights some acetic acid corrosion problems in real-world applications. The interplay between influencing factors – pH, temperature, pressure, dissolved oxygen – has been discussed in detail. Mechanistic insights into the corrosion of various steels, alloys, and pure metals have been provided. A remarkable phenomenon known as the ‘buffering effect’ makes acetic acid more corrosive than mineral acids at similar pH levels has been well explained. Acetic acid corrosion mitigation strategies, including corrosion inhibitors, coatings, and surface treatments, have been thoroughly discussed and analyzed. This review is the first of its kind to discuss acetic acid corrosion, from its occurrence to its progression and mitigation. Ultimately, this review identified several research gaps, prompting corrosion scientists to take necessary measures to address acetic acid corrosion more effectively. This review provides a valuable foundation for deeper investigations into acetic acid-induced corrosion, a challenge anticipated to persist as a critical concern across various industrial sectors. Further research is needed to enhance the long-term durability of materials exposed to corrosive conditions and to develop more effective mitigation strategies.
