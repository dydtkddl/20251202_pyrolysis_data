You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Closed loop recycling approach for aged polyamide 12 feedstocks for powder bed fusion by precipitation from a moderate solvent combined with solvolysis A major challenge in the powder bed fusion (PBF) process with polyamides, which are the most commonly used powders, is the handling of already used powder (aged powder). During PBF, polyamide powders undergo chemical ageing, resulting in altered thermal and rheological properties of the feedstock material. Components made from aged powder are of inferior quality. Therefore, aged powder is usually refreshed with new (virgin) powder. Although, a substantial amount of aged powder accumulates over the course of processing. These excess quantities are either employed in other plastic manufacturing processes (downcycling) or, more frequently, disposed. A combined process of solvolysis with subsequent thermally induced liquid-liquid phase separation and polymer crystallisation (TIPS+S) is used to restore the thermal properties and rheological properties of aged polyamide 12 (PA12) and thus to make the powders suitable for PBF again. The degree of solvolysis of the aged PA12 is tuned by reaction temperature or reaction time. A kinetic model allows to determine suitable process parameters for TIPS+S depending on the ageing condition of the feed to match the thermal properties of the recycled PA12 powders to those of PA12 virgin powder. The optimised recycled PA12 powder shows comparable zero shear viscosity, particle size distribution, particle shape and flowability to the virgin material. Specimen built from equally mixed recycled and aged PA12 powder achieved the same mechanical properties like those obtain by PBF of equally mixed virgin and aged powder. Therefore, a closed loop recycling approach is feasible, in which aged PA12 powders from the PBF process are recycled by the proposed TIPS+S process.
