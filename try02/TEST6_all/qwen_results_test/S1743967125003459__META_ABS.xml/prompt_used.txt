You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular insights into the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of low-rank coal and cellulose: Atomic tracking and labeling, interaction mechanisms, and kinetics Understanding the synergistic mechanisms between pyrolysis products is crucial for optimizing coal-biomass co-pyrolysis technology. However, the underlying microscopic mechanisms involving complex intermolecular interactions and coupled reaction pathways remain unclear, significantly limiting precise regulation of the process. Hence, this study proposes an atom-tracking and labeling strategy, employing ReaxFF MD simulations to elucidate the structural interactions and synergistic transformation mechanisms between cellulose and low-rank coal during co-pyrolysis. Results show cellulose fragments enhance char yield via crosslinking with coal molecule, while simultaneously inhibiting further polymerization into larger char structures. Moreover, the co-pyrolysis process exhibits a significant synergistic dehydrogenation effect. The generated H radicals recombine to form H2, while attacking oxygenated functional groups in coal to increase gas yield. This contributes to a lower-energy reaction pathway for coal decomposition, resulting in a 24.6 % reduction in the apparent activation energy of coal pyrolysis. The strongest synergistic effects are observed in the 2600–2800 K temperature range. Experimentally determining this temperature range can serve as a critical window for optimizing process parameters in industrial production. This study offers new insights into the synergistic effects of coal-biomass co-pyrolysis and provides a methodological inspiration for analyzing interactions in complex systems.
