You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Supercritical fluids and polymers – The year in review – 2014 A critical overview of publications on applications of supercritical fluids in polymer formation, modification and processing is presented. The review is focused on publications that appeared in 2014 only with the intent of providing an in-depth look at the activity in the most recent year to gain insights on the more recent trends and opportunities. The articles have been grouped under ten different application areas which include (1) polymer solutions and phase behavior, (2) polymerizations, (3) particle formation/micronization/drug delivery systems, (4) films, (5) fibers, (6) membranes, (7) nanocomposites, (8) porous materials – foams/scaffolds, (9) organogels, and (10) lignocellulosic polymers. In each category, articles are discussed under specific polymer or polymer type to better highlight those polymers that are receiving the greater level of attention. In 2014, more polymers were explored for their foamability, and for generation of nanocomposites. Poly(ɛ-caprolactone), poly(lactic acid) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were the most frequently investigated polymers for their porous matrix formation, or particle formation features using supercritical carbon dioxide because of their biomedical significance as biodegradable platforms for tissue engineering scaffolds and drug delivery devices. Poly(ethylene oxide), poly(lactic acid), and poly(methyl methacrylate) were the polymers that were explored in multiple application areas. Based on the close examination of these publications, the review provides specific observations on the advances that are made toward improved understanding of the factors that affect the miscibility of polymers in carbon dioxide, and for further understanding of the synergistic or other effects of components in polymer blends and composites, including the consequences of the presence of crystalline versus amorphous domains and morphological differences, or the consequences of the presence of nanofillers in different applications. New perspectives that are emerging in each application area are presented.
