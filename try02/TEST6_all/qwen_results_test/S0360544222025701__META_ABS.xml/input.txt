Thermocatalytic pyrolysis of Sesbania bispinosa biomass over Y-zeolite catalyst towards clean fuel and valuable chemicals The thermocatalytic pyrolysis of Sesbania bispinosa (SB) biomass was performed in a cylindrical-shaped pyrolyzer to produce renewable fuel and chemicals. The important process parameters, such as temperature, heating rate, and N2 flow rate, were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). Pyrolysis of the SB biomass was also performed at different catalyst to biomass ratios (C/B) (1:3, 1:6, 1:9, and 1:12). The pyrolysis findings indicated that normal pyrolysis produced a greater yield of bio-oil (42.53 wt %) than catalytic pyrolysis (40.71 wt %) that obtained at 1:9 C/B ratio. The use of catalyst reduced the yield of bio-oil; however, fuel characteristics get enhanced. FTIR analysis of normal and catalytic bio-oil verified the existence of different functional groups, whereas GCMS result at optimized pyrolysis condition confirmed increased hydrocarbons in the catalytic bio-oil. Further, the characterization result of the biochar revealed its potential for use in a variety of industrial and agricultural applications.
