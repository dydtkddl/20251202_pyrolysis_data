You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermocatalytic pyrolysis of Sesbania bispinosa biomass over Y-zeolite catalyst towards clean fuel and valuable chemicals The thermocatalytic pyrolysis of Sesbania bispinosa (SB) biomass was performed in a cylindrical-shaped pyrolyzer to produce renewable fuel and chemicals. The important process parameters, such as temperature, heating rate, and N2 flow rate, were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). Pyrolysis of the SB biomass was also performed at different catalyst to biomass ratios (C/B) (1:3, 1:6, 1:9, and 1:12). The pyrolysis findings indicated that normal pyrolysis produced a greater yield of bio-oil (42.53 wt %) than catalytic pyrolysis (40.71 wt %) that obtained at 1:9 C/B ratio. The use of catalyst reduced the yield of bio-oil; however, fuel characteristics get enhanced. FTIR analysis of normal and catalytic bio-oil verified the existence of different functional groups, whereas GCMS result at optimized pyrolysis condition confirmed increased hydrocarbons in the catalytic bio-oil. Further, the characterization result of the biochar revealed its potential for use in a variety of industrial and agricultural applications.
