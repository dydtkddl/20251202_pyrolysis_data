You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of poly(methyl methacrylate) polymers: Kinetics and recovery of monomers using a fluidized bed reactor Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a versatile transparent thermoplastic that is used in a wide range of fields and applications, such as in the lenses of exterior lights of automobiles, in electronics, in food containers and in artificial marble. When PMMA is subject to thermal degradation conditions, it degrades mainly into its monomer, methyl methacrylate (MMA). In this study, a virgin PMMA copolymer composed of 97.5% methyl methacrylate, 2.5% methyl acrylate (MA) and PMMA waste plastics were investigated. Kinetic measurements of the thermal degradation of the virgin copolymer were carried out with a TGA. The Chatterjee–Conrad (CC) and Freeman–Caroll (FC) models were applied to determine the pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Both models simulated the experimental DTG curves fairly well. In addition, pyrolysis of the virgin copolymer and the PMMA wastes was carried out using a fluidized bed reactor to recover the monomer. The reaction temperatures ranged from 450 to 500°C. In each case, the rate of oil recovery was over 97%, and the content of the MMA in the oils was up to 98wt%. The MMA recovered from the experiments can be used as feedstock for the polymerization of PMMA.
