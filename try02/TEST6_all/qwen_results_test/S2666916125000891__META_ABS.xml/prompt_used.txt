You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing the use of pyrolysis waste oil as a feedstock for the naphtha cracking process by hydrotreating and hydrocracking In this study, a process using hydroprocessing technology was investigated to utilize waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO) produced from a 10-ton/day commercial rotary kiln pyrolysis reactor as feedstock for the naphtha cracking center (NCC) process. Experiments were conducted using two continuous processes with different capacities to perform hydroprocessing and hydrocracking reactions. Reactivity according to feedstock processing, reaction stages, and process configuration, as well as the effects of process operating variables, were evaluated. Hydrocracking of the hydrotreated WPPO was found to result in particularly high performance compared to the single hydrocracking reaction alone. As the reaction severity increased, the yield and impurity reduction improved, finally achieving an impurity content close to commercial naphtha and a naphtha yield of approximately 93.3 ​wt%. Additionally, hydrogen consumption was confirmed to be comparable to that in conventional oil refineries. This study confirmed that the operating conditions can be adjusted according to the desired yield and impurity content levels or the feed ratio to the NCC process, to select the appropriate operating conditions, and that commercial-level naphtha or naphtha suitable for the specifications of the NCC process can be produced from WPPO.
