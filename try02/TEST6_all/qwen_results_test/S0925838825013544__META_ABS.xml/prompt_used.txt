You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

ZIF-67 derived superhydrophilic Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC to construct self-supported electrode for boosting electrochemical water splitting Engineering interface, regulating morphology, and doping heteroatoms are regarded as effective strategies for boosting the electrocatalytic performances of transition-metal phosphides (TMPs), while still encounter some challenges to obtain desirable stability and sustaining catalytic activity. Herein, the Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 self-supported electrode was successfully synthesized via pyrolysis of FeNi/ZIF-67/CC precursors followed by phosphating. In this structure, Fe-doped CoP and Ni2P composite nanoparticles are uniformly confined in the porous carbon matrix and anchored firmly on the surface of carbon cloth (CC). Moreover, the flocculent-like Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 demonstrates superhydrophilicity to significantly facilitate mass transfer, while the unique morphology originates from a facile strategy of soaking ZIF-67/CC in the mixed solution composed of FeSO4 and NiSO4. The synthesized Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 integrates the advantages of abundant active sites, confinement effect, interface regulation and superhydrophilicity, thereby demonstrating superior HER and OER activities and stabilities in an alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH). Remarkably, Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 electrodes used both as anode and cathode require a cell voltage of only 1.49 V at 10 mA cm−2, much lower than that of the well-established 20 % Pt-C/CC and RuO2/CC couple (1.612 V). Besides, Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 system exhibits an outstanding stability for monitoring water splitting up to 100 h at 10 mA cm−2. DFT results further confirm that the heterointerface and Fe doping in Fe-CoP/Ni2P@NC/CC-350 lead to a upshift d-band center of active sites and decreased reaction Gibbs energy barrier for the rate-determining step during catalysis, thereby contributing to the superior HER and OER activities. The work provides a novel strategy to construct a superhydrophilic microstructure, and the synergistic effect of electrons originating from the heterointerface and doping paves the way for designing electrocatalysts with high activities toward water splitting.
