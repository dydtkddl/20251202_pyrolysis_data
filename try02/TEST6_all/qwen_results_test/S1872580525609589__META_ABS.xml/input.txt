N-doped activated carbons from leather waste produced by microwave activation for use as the cathode of Li-S batteries The use of carbon from waste biomass has the potential to eliminate the drawbacks of Li-S batteries and improve their overall performance. Chrome-tanned-leathershavings (CTLS) are a readily available waste product that can be transformed into porous carbon. We prepared an activated carbon by microwave pyrolysis combined with KOH activator using the CTLS as starting materials. The carbon had a specific surface area of 556 m2g−1 and a honeycomb-like structure. Two kinds of N-doped activated carbons were then synthesized by thermal decomposition of the activated carbon, either combined with urea, or impregnated with ethanolamine. Both N-doped activated carbons have an increased number of nitrogen and amine surface groups. However, only the urea treatment was effective in improving the initial capacity of the cell (1363 mAh g−1), which is probably linked to the sorption of long-chain polysulfides. This investigation confirms that it is possible to use the thermal decomposition of urea to obtain carbon materials from CTLS for use as the sulfur-host cathode in Li-S batteries and improve their performance. A radial basis function neural network was fitted to provide statistical support for the experimental results, which confirmed the importance of the nitrogen content of the carbons in determining the discharge capacity of the cells.
