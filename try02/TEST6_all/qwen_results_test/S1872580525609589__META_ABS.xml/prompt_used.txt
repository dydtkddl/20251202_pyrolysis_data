You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

N-doped activated carbons from leather waste produced by microwave activation for use as the cathode of Li-S batteries The use of carbon from waste biomass has the potential to eliminate the drawbacks of Li-S batteries and improve their overall performance. Chrome-tanned-leathershavings (CTLS) are a readily available waste product that can be transformed into porous carbon. We prepared an activated carbon by microwave pyrolysis combined with KOH activator using the CTLS as starting materials. The carbon had a specific surface area of 556 m2g−1 and a honeycomb-like structure. Two kinds of N-doped activated carbons were then synthesized by thermal decomposition of the activated carbon, either combined with urea, or impregnated with ethanolamine. Both N-doped activated carbons have an increased number of nitrogen and amine surface groups. However, only the urea treatment was effective in improving the initial capacity of the cell (1363 mAh g−1), which is probably linked to the sorption of long-chain polysulfides. This investigation confirms that it is possible to use the thermal decomposition of urea to obtain carbon materials from CTLS for use as the sulfur-host cathode in Li-S batteries and improve their performance. A radial basis function neural network was fitted to provide statistical support for the experimental results, which confirmed the importance of the nitrogen content of the carbons in determining the discharge capacity of the cells.
