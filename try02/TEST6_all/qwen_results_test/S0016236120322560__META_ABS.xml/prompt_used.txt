You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comparative study on pyrolysis of bundle and fluffy shapes of waste packaging plastics The pyrolysis of waste packaging plastic was performed in a semi-batch reactor to study the effect of the shape of reactant on the compositions of pyrolysis oils under N2 gas inflow conditions. Bundle and fluffy shapes of reactants were pyrolyzed at 400 °C for 90 min at N2 inflow rates from 0 to 300 mL/min. The yields of pyrolysis oils were between 67.7 and 76.1% under the reaction conditions, and diesel-like middle oil (C11–C22) was mainly produced with mass fractions over 64%. The main oil product was mostly composed of n-paraffin and n-olefin compounds, and its mass fraction was considerably influenced by the reactant shape and the N2 flow rate. The pyrolysis of the fluff reactant exhibited higher middle oil fractions with higher fraction ratios of n-paraffins to n-olefins than the bundle reactant. This study suggests that the compositions of pyrolysis oil could be controlled by the reactant shape and the N2 inflow, which will provide important information for improving the quality of oil products in a large-scale of pyrolysis processes, and for developing a continuous pyrolysis system because the fluffy shape of reactant is more suitable for continuous feeding.
