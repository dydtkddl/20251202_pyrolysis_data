You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytical thermal conversion of waste fishing nets for a higher added value energy products generation and caprolactam recovery The ongoing eutrophication processes and water pollution caused by marine plastic waste are relevant ecological problem. Collected wastes are possible alternative feedstock for additional higher added value energy product generation. Moreover, caprolactamis the main compound of nylon-6 waste fishing nets and its recovery conserves natural resources, maximizes waste economic performance, and closes the circular economy loop of the fishing net industry. In order to contribute to the creation of circular economy, investigation of pyrolysis process and the effect of catalyst synergy with different temperatures on the formulated products has been performed. This work aims to analyse the used fishing nets (FN), using TGA-DTG-FTIR systems and mini pyrolysis plant. Experiments were conducted with Y-type zeolite and ZSM-5 as catalysts with a ratio of 1 by 3 and 1 by 8, respectively. Micro-thermal analysis using the TGA-DTG-FTIR system was processed for feedstock characterization purposes, which showed that the fishing gear has one minor decomposition peak around 200 °C, and the major one around 450 °C, with a total weight loss of 88 wt%. Pyro-oils analysis showed that the main fractions could be assigned to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as naphthalene, styrene, and toluene. Moreover, the recovery of caprolactam shows a possibility to obtain not only energy products, but also higher added value chemical derivatives. Temperature and catalyst synergetic approach influence for the recovered products investigation showed the optimum conditions as 700 °C for the highest purity and quality products generation. Based on the results, catalytic thermal treatment at 700 °C with Y-Type could be adapted as a promising technique for extracting of caprolactam with a high yield (96 %).
