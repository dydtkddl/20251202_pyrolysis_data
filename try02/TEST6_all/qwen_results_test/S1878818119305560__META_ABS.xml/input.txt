Groundnut shell -a beneficial bio-waste Groundnut shells account for approximately 20% of the dried peanut pod by weight, meaning there is a significant amount of shell residual left after groundnut processing. Increased groundnut production leads to the accumulation of these groundnut shells which is not utilized, thus either burnt or buried. As Groundnut shells are rich in many functional compounds and composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, it can be utilized in multiple ways. This review highlights potential applications of groundnut shells for commercial and industrial purposes. Groundnut shells can be converted in various bio-products such as biodiesel, bioethanol, nano-sheet and also has applications in enzyme and hydrogen production, dye and heavy metal degradation etc. An efficient management strategy is required to convert this otherwise considered waste into valuable bio-products to achieve zero waste production system.
