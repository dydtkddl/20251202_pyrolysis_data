You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of benzene/toluene/ethyl benzene/xylene (BTEX) via multiphase catalytic pyrolysis of hazardous waste polyethylene using low cost fly ash synthesized natural catalyst The valuable aromatics benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) were effectively produced from waste polyethylene (PE) using fly ash synthesized catalyst. The BTEX yield was enhanced significantly using multiphase catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene. Low cost natural catalyst was synthesized from fly ash (FA) in 5 different synthesized form i.e., fly ash in natural form (FAN), fly ash calcined at 600 °C (FA-600), 700 °C (FA-700), 800 °C (FA-800) and 900 °C (FA-900). The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis both were conducted in a specially designed semi-batch reactor at the temperature range of 500–800 °C. Catalytic pyrolysis were performed in two different phases within the reactor batch by batch systematically, keeping the catalyst in a liquid phase (A-Type) and liquid and vapor phase/multiphase (B-Type), respectively. The maximum liquid yield of 78.20 wt% was obtained at a temperature of 700 °C using FA-800 catalyst in A-type arrangement. Total aromatics (BTEX) of 10.92 wt% was obtained for thermal pyrolysis at a temperature of 700 °C. In contrary, the aromatic (BTEX) contents were significantly increased for the catalytic pyrolysis in both reactor arrangement A and B types, nearly doubled from 10.92 wt% (thermal pyrolysis) to 21.34 wt% for A-type and 22.12 wt% for B type/multiphase. The pyrolysis oil was characterized using GC-FID, carbon residue test and other fuel testing methods to evaluate the suitability of its end use and aromatic content.
