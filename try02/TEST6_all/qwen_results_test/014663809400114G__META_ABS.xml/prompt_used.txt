You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of kinetic analysis of source rocks and kerogen concentrates Shales and kerogen concentrates from the Green River, Rundel, Ohio, Draupne, and Phosphoria formations were examined by Pyromat II micropyrolysis and kinetic parameters were determined by the shift-in-T max, discrete distribution, modified Friedman, and modified Coats-Redfern methods. Overall, the shales and corresponding kerogens exhibited very similar kinetic parameters. Green River, Rundel, and Ohio shales and kerogens exhibited principal discrete activation energies of 54–57 kcal/mol, narrow distributions, and T max at 25°C/min heating rate around 480°C. Draupne and Phosphoria shales and kerogens exhibited kinetic parameters typical of Type II source rocks—principal discrete activation energies of 54–57 kcal/mol, broad distributions, and T max at 25°C/min around 459°C. The discrete distribution kinetic parameters were used to calculate oil generation at laboratory and geological heating rates. Each shale and corresponding kerogen exhibited generation curves and 50% generation temperatures that were very similar. The principal difference was that the kerogens exhibited slightly more oil generation at low temperatures compared to the corresponding shales. Some kerogens exhibited curves which were also shifted to slightly lower temperatures than those of the corresponding shales. For these specific shales and kerogens, the results indicate that kerogen isolation does little to affect the pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Although from a limited number of samples, these results suggest kerogen isolation may not be necessary to derive valid kinetic parameters.
