You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in scalable 2D material synthesis: Flash Joule heating and beyond Flash Joule Heating (FJH) utilizes a variety of carbonaceous waste, such as garbage, biomass, plastic, and coal, to produce high-quality 2D materials, such as turbostratic flash graphene, in a scalable, low-energy, and green route. Unlike conventional strategies, FJH produces instantaneous heating (up to 3000 K) in milliseconds, enabling carbon conversion directly without the need for catalysts, solvents, or any additional energy. The obtained graphene exhibits excellent structural, thermal, and electrochemical performance, with high purity defined as ≥95 at.% carbon, as determined by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and with minimal heteroatom impurities (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur). The approach also allows morphological adjustment as well as control over porosity, and therefore it can find application in energy storage, composites, electrocatalysis, and environmental clean-up. Life cycle and techno-economic evaluation confirms drastic greenhouse gas emission, water usage, and production cost savings in comparison with the traditional synthesis technique. Its coupling with machine learning has further encouraged process optimization and material quality, precisely predicting yield and crystallinity. FJH's capability to convert low-value waste into high-value nanomaterials means that it can become a central point in promoting sustainable nonmanufacturing and the circular economy. FJH-based manufacturing of graphene has been covered within this review which also discusses the trend toward industrialization and commercialization of green technology.
