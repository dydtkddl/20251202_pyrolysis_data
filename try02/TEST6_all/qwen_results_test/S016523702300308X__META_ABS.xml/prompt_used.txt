You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorizing disposable face masks into non-condensable hydrocarbon gases via optimal reactor configurations in thermal pyrolysis Pyrolysis studies often overlook the potential of pyrolytic gas as a valuable hydrocarbon resource, thereby hindering the production of advanced carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNM). This study aims to explore various configurations of a multi-zone tubular reactor to upcycle disposable face masks into non-condensable hydrocarbons as potential CNM precursors. The highest gas yield (56.2 wt%) was achieved using a 3-zone configuration (Z-1,3,4), attributed to the end chain scission mechanism. The increased abundance of light hydrocarbons (≤C10) in the resulting liquid confirms a greater extent of end chain scission in the optimum reactor configuration with cold zone retainment. Employing this configuration, different face mask types, including 3ply (polypropylene-based), KF94 (polypropylene-based) and N95 (polyester-based), were utilized as individual feedstocks or in various ratios as mixtures to investigate the resultant composition of hydrocarbon gases. This composition was compared with existing literature studies to identify suitable hydrocarbon gas compositions for CNM production. Mixing 3ply and KF94 face masks produced a consistent gas composition predominantly comprising propylene (62.3 – 66.9%) and ethane (15.4 – 16.8%) via thermal pyrolysis at 500 ℃ with a constant heating rate of 20 ℃/min. However, the inclusion of N95 face masks increased CO2 level fivefold, diminishing the gas quality as a CNM precursor. These findings underscore the necessity of segregating polyester face mask material from polypropylene face mask material prior to pyrolysis to ensure a consistent quality and yield of CNM precursors.
