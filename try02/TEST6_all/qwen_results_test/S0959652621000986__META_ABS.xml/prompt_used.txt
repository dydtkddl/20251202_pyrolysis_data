You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microcrystalline paraffin wax, biogas, carbon particles and aluminum recovery from metallised food packaging plastics using pyrolysis, mechanical and chemical treatments Metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW) is the most complex part of plastic waste ever with poor recyclability. In order to close the circle loop of MFPWs and to increase their economic and environmental benefits according to the zero waste principle, this research aims to convert MFPWs into energy products (Microcrystalline paraffin wax and biogas) and raw materials (carbon particles and aluminum) using three combined approaches: pyrolysis, mechanical and chemical treatments. The thermal treatment using mini-pyrolysis plant (capacity of 250 g) was applied as the main treatment to convert MFPWs into three main energy products: biooil, biogas, and char mixed with aluminum flakes (Al/char) at 25 °C/min up to 500, 600, and 700 °C, while the mechanical treatment using milling process was used to break the bonds between char and Al flakes, thus liberating Al flakes after sieving process. Finally, the leaching process using hydrochloric acid was employed to extract the remaining Al particles from the milled Al/char and to recover the carbon particles simultaneously, using a density separation method. The experiments were performed on a mixture of five types of equal shares of packages (potato chips, chocolate, bakery, coffee, and biscuits). The obtained energy products and recovered materials were analyzed by GC, FTIR, ICP, and SEM-EDS. The results showed that MFPWs can be decomposed thermally into Al/char (99.4%) only up to 500 °C, while in case of 600 and 700 °C, they can be converted into microcrystalline paraffin wax (19.5%), biogas (63%), and Al/char (17.8%). Also, the mechanical and chemical treatments were succeeded by leaching >90 wt% of Al and extraction of carbon particles on a micro-scale (10–50 μm). Finally, the assessment of economic performance and greenhouse gases showed that application of the developed approach on an industrial scale can provide an economic return up to 610 $/ton of MFPWs and decrease carbon footprint by −984 kg CO2-eq/t of MFPWs.
