You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transportation fuel production by catalytic co-pyrolysis of pinewood biomass and used engine oil over HZSM-5@MCM-41 catalysts In this study, the performance of HZSM-5@MCM-41 core–shell catalysts was evaluated for the co-pyrolysis of pinewood (as a biomass source) and used engine oil (as hydrogen-rich waste) to enhance bio-oil quality. The results indicated that the use of catalysts increased biogas yield while reducing bio-oil yield, attributed to the removal of oxygenated functional groups. The investigation demonstrated that the catalytic co-pyrolysis process’s effectiveness in improving bio-oil quality depended significantly on the ratio of micro- and mesoporous structures. Among the catalysts examined, HZ/MC-1.5 (CTAB/HZSM-5 = 1.5) exhibited superior performance in terms of crystallinity, acidity, and surface properties. The incorporation of MCM-41 shells on the HZSM-5 core reduced coke formation from 4.2 % in the HZSM-5 catalyst to 1.5 % in the HZ/MC-1.5 catalyst, thereby enhancing catalytic activity during the co-pyrolysis process. The HZ/MC-1.5 core–shell catalyst achieved the highest degree of deoxygenation (78.1 %) and produced biofuels with improved quality, characterized by the highest H/Ceff ratio (1.65), the highest HHV (42.56 MJ/kg), and the lowest O/C ratio (0.05). In the presence of the HZ/MC-1.5 catalyst, the highest yields of aromatic (30.12 %) and naphthenic (21.13 %) compounds were obtained. Furthermore, the catalyst improved the yield of gasoline-, kerosene-, and diesel-range hydrocarbons compared to HZSM-5, with minimal impact on the yield of heavy components (>C20). The biofuel produced via catalytic co-pyrolysis in this study exhibited significantly improved properties compared to commercial heavy fuel and was comparable to commercial diesel and gasoline fuels.
