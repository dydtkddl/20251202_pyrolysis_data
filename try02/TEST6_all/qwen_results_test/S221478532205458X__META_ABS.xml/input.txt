Optimization and simulation of heat loss in pyrolysis reactor Heat loss is a major bottleneck of pyrolysis process. To overcome this problem, internal heating through electrical heater is being proposed. This work embraces modeling and simulation of thermal pyrolysis process through Free CAD. The simulation uses energy balance calculations to predict the heat loses depending on various sets of operating condition for instance supplied temperature and type of feedstock used. The simulated results were found as heat loss, Qloss = 434.27 KW/day, whereas in conventional method the heat loss was observed as Qloss = 515.53 KW/day. ΔH and ΔS was enhanced at the same temperature. The simulated results are shown in terms of reduction in heat losses and found to be 2.709% in the current study. The experimental results were found as heat loss Qloss = 45.88 KW/day was determined in the experimental results. On the other hand, heat loss in conventional process was 72.56 KW/day. Experimental findings were calculated in terms of reduction in heat loss which is slightly increased and the optimum condition was also investigated. The experimental results could be used to intensify the conventional pyrolysis process.
