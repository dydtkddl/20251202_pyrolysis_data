Identification of suitable catalyst among HZSM-5, HY and γ-Al2O3 to obtain upgraded pyrolysis oil with augmented liquid oil yield This study examines catalytic ability of various zeolite materials in converting discarded tire pyrolyzed oil by employing a moderate sized pyrolysis plant of a 10 L working volume. The study revealed that the yield of liquid fractions using γ-Al2O3 was greater than that of HZSM-5 and HY, while the yield of condensates were limited in the absence of catalyst. The tire waste pyrolysis oil catalytcially enhanced by alumina catalyst analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy exhibited the stretching bands corresponding to aromatic and non-aromatic compounds. The GC MS analysis revealed that the cyclic unsaturated fragment percentages in liquids were decreased by the catalysts to 53.9% with HY, 59.0% with γ-Al2O3, and 62.2% with HZSM-5, which in turn was converted into aromatic chemicals. Nitrogen adsorption desorption analysis revealed that γ-Al2O3 has an enhanced surface area of 635 m2/g which improved its catalytic performance. The cracked liquid oil had viscosity (10.36 cSt), values of pour and flash temperatures of −2.2 °C and 41 °C respectively, analogous to petroleum diesel. The upgraded pyrolysis oil (10%) is blended with gasoline (90%), and emission analysis was performed. Moreover, liquid oil needs post treatment (refining) for its use as energy source in transportation application. The novelty of this research is in its comparative analysis of multiple catalysts under controlled conditions using a small pilot-scale pyrolysis reactor, which provides insights into optimizing the pyrolysis process for industrial applications.
