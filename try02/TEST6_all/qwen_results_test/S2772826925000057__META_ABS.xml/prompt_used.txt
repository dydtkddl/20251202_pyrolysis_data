You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergetic co-pyrolysis of waste Bakelite and Thevetia peruviana seeds: Insights from kinetics, thermodynamics, and product composition The growing environmental damage from plastic and biomass waste requires urgent improvements in co-pyrolysis with optimized reactors to efficiently convert wastes into valuable products. So, this study examines the synergetic kinetics and thermodynamics of co-pyrolysis of Bakelite and Thevetia peruviana (Kaner) seed blend (1:1 w/w) using thermogravimetric analysis at different heating rates (5–50 °C/min.) and temperatures (30–1000 °C), aiming to convert waste into valuable products, with pyrolytic waxy oil analyzed by FTIR and GC–MS. The weight loss of the blend (79.70 %) is higher by 19.36 % as compared to Bakelite alone (60.34 %). The synergistic interaction between Kaner seed and Bakelite reduces the activation energy of pyrolysis by 26.76 % from that required for Bakelite pyrolysis and by 16.13 % from that required for Kaner seed pyrolysis. The kinetic mechanism of thermal degradation remains unchanged for Bakelite (F5) and its blend with Kaner seed (F5), whereas Kaner seed exhibits a different degradation mechanism(F4). The thermal degradation of the blend shows lower ΔG (466.990 kJ/mol) and ΔH (67.734 kJ/mol) and a higher ΔS (-1014.355 × 10⁻³ kJK⁻¹mol⁻¹) than both Bakelite and Kaner seed. The pyrolysis of the blend shows a 17.27 % increase in waxy oil yield compared to Bakelite alone. GC–MS analysis of pyrolytic oil shows a significant change in the composition of the oil obtained from the blended sample compared to the individual sample due to a synergistic effect, which is also supported by FTIR analysis. This study will help optimize the co-pyrolysis process and reactor design for real-scale applications.
