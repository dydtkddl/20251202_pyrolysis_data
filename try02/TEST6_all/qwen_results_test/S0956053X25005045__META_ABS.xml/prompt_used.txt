You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Heat transfer and parameter optimization for medical waste pyrolysis in an indirectly heated rotary kiln This study investigated the pyrolysis of mixed medical waste (MMW) in an indirectly heated rotary kiln, focusing on the effects of operating parameters (filling ratio, heat source temperature, and rotation speed) on the heat transfer performance and product distribution. The pyrolysis behaviors of individual components (cotton swabs, paper, bandages, and plastics) and their composite mixtures were characterized using thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA). The heat transfer characteristics, chemical reaction properties, kiln operating parameters, and interactions between the processes were also investigated. It was found that endothermic reactions in MMW irradiation retard the heating rate, and the operating parameters can modulate this effect. Lower filling ratios improved temperature uniformity during drying and the first pyrolysis(25–371 ℃). The heat transfer coefficient decreased from 182.2 to 153.5 W/(m2·K) as the filling ratio increased from 11.3 % to 37.5 %, with an decelerated reduction rate observed beyond 22.5 %. Elevated heat source temperatures (750–850 ℃) accelerated pyrolysis completion (5.04 h-2.28 h) and enhanced the heat transfer coefficient from 147.6 to 241.8 W/(m2·K), while also increasing the gas yield (35.58–39.30 %). A rotation speed threshold (1.5 rpm) governs the solid transport regime transitions, with higher speeds (0.5–3 rpm) improving the heat transfer coefficient from 169.2 to 186.5 W/(m2·K). These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing the energy efficiency and throughput of industrial-scale MMW pyrolysis systems. Environmental Implications The pyrolysis of medical waste offers a sustainable solution for reducing hazardous waste volumes and recovering valuable resources. This study demonstrates that kiln optimizing parameters (e.g., filling ratio, heat source temperature, and rotation speed) can enhance energy efficiency and product yield while minimizing environmental pollution. By converting medical waste into usable products, such as syngas and biochar, this process reduces landfill dependency and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby promoting scalable and eco-friendly waste management practices. This study contributes to the advancement of circular economy strategies for healthcare waste treatment, aligning with the global sustainability goals.
