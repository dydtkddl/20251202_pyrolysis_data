You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvent-free ball milling activation of cellulose for efficient surface modification and pyrolysis Due to the innate recalcitrancy caused by robust hydrogen bonding interaction, cellulose cannot be easily processed into high-valued materials or chemicals. Herein, a solvent-free ball milling treatment was conducted to activate microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The research results demonstrated that ball milling treatment rapidly reduced the average particle size (Ð) and crystalline index (CrI) of MCC. Ball milling treatment for 1 h resulted in the Ð and CrI of MCC decreasing from 48 μm and 84.5 % to 23.3 μm and 25.4 %, respectively. Further prolonging the ball milling time from 1 h to 4 h slightly reduced the Ð and CrI of cellulose but led to the degradation of cellulose. Furthermore, the ball milling-activated cellulose (BMC) was chemically modified for preparing polylactic acid (PLA)/modified cellulose (m-BMC) composite films. Benefitting from the decreased Ð and valid surface modification of BMC, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the achieved PLA/m-BMC improved by 77.2 % and 189.3 % compared with the PLA/MCC, respectively. Besides, ball milling for 1 h improved the relative contents of saccharides in the pyrolysis products of cellulose from 33.2 % to 60.4 %. This work provided some basic understanding of ball milling activation of cellulose for further efficient surface modification and pyrolysis.
