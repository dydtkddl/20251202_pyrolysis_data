You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in safe processing of sugarcane and bagasse for the generation of biofuels and bioactive compounds Sugarcane is a tall, stout, perennial grass with fibrous stalks rich in sucrose used for sugar production. Sugarcane is widely used to produce sugar, ethanol, and other bioactive compounds. However, the processing of sugarcane and its byproduct bagasse can result in negative environmental impacts and safety hazards. Therefore, safe, and sustainable processing methods are crucial for the generation of biofuels and bioactive compounds. Sugarcane and its by-products contain high levels of phytochemicals such as phytosterols, terpenoids, flavonoids, fatty acids, and phenolic acids. The phytochemicals and the microbial populations associated with sugarcane that live in the soil (rhizosphere) and on the surface (phyllosphere) contain a wealth of potentially valuable microbes for industrial applications. Using metagenomics and meta-omics techniques, various microbes have been identified and characterized for their role in breaking down sugarcane bagasse, a substantial source of lignocellulosic biomass. Other valuable products of sugarcane include molasses, which offers an intense flavor, whereas bagasse is used to produce paperboard products, reconstituted panelboard, agricultural mulch, and fuel for the kilns. The sugarcane has tremendous applicability in biofuel production, animal feed additive, and electricity production. Furthermore, the paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for the safe and sustainable processing of sugarcane and bagasse. Overall, this review highlights the importance of safe and sustainable processing methods for the generation of biofuels and bioactive compounds from sugarcane and its byproduct bagasse.
