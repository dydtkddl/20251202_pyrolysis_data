Advances in safe processing of sugarcane and bagasse for the generation of biofuels and bioactive compounds Sugarcane is a tall, stout, perennial grass with fibrous stalks rich in sucrose used for sugar production. Sugarcane is widely used to produce sugar, ethanol, and other bioactive compounds. However, the processing of sugarcane and its byproduct bagasse can result in negative environmental impacts and safety hazards. Therefore, safe, and sustainable processing methods are crucial for the generation of biofuels and bioactive compounds. Sugarcane and its by-products contain high levels of phytochemicals such as phytosterols, terpenoids, flavonoids, fatty acids, and phenolic acids. The phytochemicals and the microbial populations associated with sugarcane that live in the soil (rhizosphere) and on the surface (phyllosphere) contain a wealth of potentially valuable microbes for industrial applications. Using metagenomics and meta-omics techniques, various microbes have been identified and characterized for their role in breaking down sugarcane bagasse, a substantial source of lignocellulosic biomass. Other valuable products of sugarcane include molasses, which offers an intense flavor, whereas bagasse is used to produce paperboard products, reconstituted panelboard, agricultural mulch, and fuel for the kilns. The sugarcane has tremendous applicability in biofuel production, animal feed additive, and electricity production. Furthermore, the paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for the safe and sustainable processing of sugarcane and bagasse. Overall, this review highlights the importance of safe and sustainable processing methods for the generation of biofuels and bioactive compounds from sugarcane and its byproduct bagasse.
