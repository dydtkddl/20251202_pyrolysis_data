You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodeoxygenation of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate as a model compound of polyethylene terephthalate waste using spray pyrolysis synthesis of γ-Al2O3 supported Ni-Fe catalyst Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste poses a significant environmental challenge due to its persistence and limited chemical recycling options. Conventional hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) strategies for PET depolymerization products often require high pressure or noble metals, limiting their scalability and economic viability. In this study, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), a primary glycolysis product of PET, was employed as a model compound to evaluate an efficient HDO route using non-noble, bimetallic Ni–Fe catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 under atmospheric pressure. The reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 400 - 500 °C using 2-ethylphenol as both solvent and hydrogen donor. Among the catalysts tested, Ni5-Fe15 exhibited superior performance, achieving 99.41 % BHET conversion and 76.57 % deoxygenation degree at 475 ℃. The incorporation of Fe improved acid site density and facilitated the formation of a NiFe alloy, enhancing C-O bond cleavage and selectivity toward aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene (37.37 %) and naphthalene (18.80 %). Gas analysis revealed the evolution of C1-C3 hydrocarbons and dominant CO2 formation, indicating decarboxylation as a primary pathway. The gas product analysis detected hydrocarbon gases C1-C3, suggesting various reaction pathways, including decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and demethylation. Using bimetallic catalysts resulted in a decrease in CO selectivity but an increase in CO2 selectivity, which may be attributed to the formation of NiFe alloy within the catalyst.
