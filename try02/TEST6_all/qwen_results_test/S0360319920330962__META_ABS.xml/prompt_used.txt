You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of petrochemical sludge and sawdust for syngas production by TG-MS and fixed bed reactor The main objective of this work is to investigate the syngas production from petrochemical sludge (PS) and sawdust (SD) co-pyrolysis. In this study, the pyrolysis experiments of PS, SD and their blends were carried out in TG-MS analyzer and fixed bed reactor. The effects of pyrolysis temperature and interactions between PS and SD on gas evolution behavior, products distribution and gas compositions were investigated. The PS pyrolysis result showed high temperature favored the gas production and there was a distinct increase in gas yield when temperature exceeded 700 °C. The Fe3O4 in solid was reduced by carbon with the generation of CO and CO2, leading to the increase of gas yield. During the co-pyrolysis process, significant interactions between PS and SD were observed. SD addition promoted the increase of gas yield, as well as the generation of H2 and CO. In addition, the activation energy during co-pyrolysis process was reduced due to the interaction. The strongest accelerative effect on gas yield appeared at 60 wt% SD, under which the gas yield was 39.59 wt%, H2+CO content was 61.34 vol%, LHV was 13.39 MJ/Nm3. It was concluded that SD addition was conductive to syngas production from PS pyrolysis.
