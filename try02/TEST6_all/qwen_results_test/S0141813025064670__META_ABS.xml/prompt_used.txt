You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Strengthening poly (lactic acid): The role of fractionated lignin in the development of sustainable films The growing demand for sustainable materials has increased interest in alternatives to petroleum-based polymers. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a promising candidate due to its renewable origin, but its brittleness and low thermal stability limit broader applications. This study investigates the incorporation of fractionated lignin—obtained from eucalyptus kraft lignin via ethyl acetate fractionation—to improve the mechanical, thermal, and functional properties of PLA films. Films with varying lignin contents (0–10 %) were produced by solvent casting and evaluated through mechanical testing, water vapor permeability (WVP), thermal analysis (TGA/DTG), FTIR, SEM, TEM, and color/UV–Vis analysis. Up to 6 % lignin, improvements were observed in tensile strength, elastic modulus, and thermal stability, attributed to better dispersion and interaction within the PLA matrix. WVP decreased at intermediate lignin contents, indicating a barrier effect. FTIR results suggested hydrogen bonding between lignin and PLA, while SEM revealed uniform morphology at low lignin concentrations and aggregation at higher levels. TEM confirmed lignin dispersion within the PLA matrix. Color darkening due to lignin's chromophore groups was accompanied by reduced UV transmittance, indicating potential UV protection. These findings demonstrate that PLA films reinforced with fractionated lignin are promising sustainable materials for applications requiring enhanced mechanical and barrier performance.
