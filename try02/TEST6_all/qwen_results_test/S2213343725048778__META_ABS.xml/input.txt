Ultrasound accelerates zeolite synthesis: Predictive modelling via machine learning Zeolites are versatile crystalline materials for catalysis, water purification, membrane-based separation, and dehydration. However, traditional zeolite synthesis is time consuming (up to several days) and requires toxic templates to dictate crystallographic structures. Herein, we compare ultrasonic (US)-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, direct US synthesis (i.e. without hydrothermal treatment) and mechanical stirring-assisted hydrothermal treatment to synthesize Linde Type-A (LTA) zeolite (Zeolite A) in a template-free medium. The direct US process reduces the total synthesis time from 11 h to 6 h and increases product yield by 60 %, eliminating the need for a further hydrothermal step. The direct US synthesis produces pure LTA crystals with a cubic morphology ranging from 1 μm to 14 μm, whereas mechanical stirring-assisted synthesis produces amorphous-crystalline agglomerates with average particle size of ∼25 μm. Product yield and particle size gains reached a plateau beyond US amplitudes of 35 % (61 W/L). To correlate the synthesis parameters to the LTA parameters (crystallinity, yield, and particle size) we develop and report a machine learning (ML) prediction model. Catboost, a tree-based ML model trained on 36 experimental data points achieved the highest accuracy among 5 models evaluated in predicting yield (R2 = 0.93), particle size (R2 = 0.91), and crystallinity (R2 = 0.88). The energy delivered to the system (US amplitude) was determined by the model to be the most significant parameter for all outputs. An ensemble model improved the yield predictions (R2 = 0.98).
