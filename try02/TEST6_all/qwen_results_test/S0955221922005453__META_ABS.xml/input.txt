Enabling water-based processing of graphene/alumina composites using an infiltration approach with amphiphilic triblock copolymers Enabling the direct infiltration of freeze-cast graphene structures with water-based ceramic suspensions, otherwise prevented by graphene’s intrinsic hydrophobic behaviour, can lead to the production of hierarchical graphene/ceramic composites in a cost-effective and replicable manner. In this study, the addition of a triblock copolymer (PF127) in the formulation of water-based alumina slurries was used to allow the integration with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) scaffolds combining freeze-casting, wet chemistry processing and Spark Plasma Sintering. Wettability and infiltration tests were performed to optimise the composition of the ceramic suspension, leading to the preservation of alignment in embedded rGO scaffolds and maintaining channel widths of 5–15▒μm upon sintering at 1500∘ C.
