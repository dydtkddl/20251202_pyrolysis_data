You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A TG-FTIR investigation on the co-pyrolysis of the waste HDPE, PP, PS and PET under high heating conditions The present study relates to the investigation of degradation of polymers such as HDPE, PP, PS and PET individually and in mixed forms. Eleven different mixture combinations were analyzed via TG Analysis to determine their degradation behavior individually and in mixed forms. FTIR analysis of the raw polymers was performed to investigate the presence of different functional groups in the sample. Online TG-FTIR analysis was performed to investigate the functional groups present in the volatiles fractions during single component pyrolysis and the interaction of polymers during co-pyrolysis was analyzed, compared and reported. Also, a real-world post consumer mixed waste was also analyzed and compared. During the co-pyrolysis of HDPE with PP and PS, the degradation of PP was delayed whereas PS reduced the degradation temperature of HDPE. In the case of degradation of PS with PP and PET, the increase in degradation temperature was reported whereas, in the case of PET and HDPE mixture, the degradation temperature of HDPE was reduced. During the interaction of PP and PET mixed degradation, PET degradation temperature was delayed. During the FTIR analysis a large amount of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics groups were observed during the degradation of HDPE, PP and PS whereas in case of PET the presence of oxygenated groups is observed. During the mixed degradation, the presence of PET in the sample caused the formation of oxygenated groups by reducing the absorption intensity of other groups or by disappearing the groups. Compounds such as benzoic acid, CO and CO2 was detected during the degradation of PET whereas in other polymers a large amount of methane or methylene group is observed. Overall during the degradation of mixed polymer mixture presence of PET played a vital role in the formation of light gas fractions. Even though a numerous investigation on co-pyrolysis of polymers were available, there is still not sufficient information of interaction of polymers with each other, especially with PET. This article attempts to fill this gap.
