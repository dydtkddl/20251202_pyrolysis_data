Heteropolyacid hosted to nano-silica catalyst for the oxidation of methacrolein In this study, a catalyst was synthesized using a two-step in-situ molecular beam epitaxy method to grow H4PMo11VO40 (HPAV) on amination-treated SiO2 nanoparticles, which served as both dopant and host agents. SiO2 dopant was modified with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTS), facilitating the formation of ammonium ions that enhanced the overall positive charge. This modification enabled the effective dispersion and exposure of HPAV's active species and induced a structural transformation of HPAV from a triclinic to a cubic crystal phase. The two-step hosting growth process optimized the proportions of Cs+, H+ and NH4 + antinuclear ions, thereby fine-tuning the synergistic catalysis of oxidation and acidity, as well as the oxidative sensitivity at HPAV catalytic interface. The resultant 8(HPAV)&4(Cs3PAV)-NH2-SiO2 catalyst achieved a methacrolein (MAL) conversion rate of 84% and a methacrylic acid (MAA) selectivity of 71%. Even after 10.5 h of reaction time, the catalyst retained its high dispersion, cubic crystal structure, and Keggin configuration, demonstrating stable catalytic performance over a continuous 200-h reaction period.
