You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of Methylene blue from aqueous solution with activated carbon produced from hazelnut shells by K2CO3 activation The purpose of this investigation is to produce activated carbon from hazelnut shells by using chemical activation method of potassium carbonate. For the activation, the shells were milled and sieved in range of 50–150 mesh and then impregnation ratios were selected at the ranges of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. The carbonisation was carried out under the N2 gas pressure with flow rate of 100 mL min–1 at 873.15 K for 120 min. The characterization of carbonization of activated carbon were executed with the X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy after drying samples and also in order to determine the adsorption capacity, the iodine and Methylene blue numbers were used. In this research, the microporous character of series of activated carbons has been analyzed using of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. N2(BET) surface area was found to have the maximum BET area as 644 m2 g–1, the absorbants of iodine and Methylene blue numbers were determined 1,974 mg/I2 and 489 mg g–1, respectively for 70 mesh in the impregnation ratio of 1:2. In the addition to that the kinetic of Methylene blue adsorption were determined by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and also the thermodynamic parameters were calculated to see whether the adsorption was spontaneous or not. The experimental data indicated that the adsorption isotherms were well matched by the Langmuir equilibrium isotherm equation given as 454.5 mg g−1 at 293 K.
