You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a novel fixed bed reactor system for the production of high value gasoline range hydrocarbons (HC) Pyrolysis is a promising thermolysis technique to recover valuable oils and light hydrocarbons (HC) with high yields from plastic solid waste (PSW). In this work, thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with the aim of producing gasoline range hydrocarbon oils, has been carried out in a novel fixed bed (batch) reactor. The pyrolysis of HDPE has been conducted between 500 to 800 °C in the presence of nitrogen as an inert carrier gas media to produce liquid fuel oil, gaseous products and solid char. The optimum temperature of obtaining maximum oil product yield (70%) was 550° C. A comprehensive gas chromatography (GC) analysis of the liquid and gaseous products was conducted to quantify high molecular weight individual HC components. Moreover, light molecular weight HC constituting the gaseous fraction were identified. A chemical kinetic analysis of the cracking reactions, was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of yielding the maximum oil product. The oil product recovered had a high proportion of aliphatic HC especially in the range of C8 to C12, whilst aromatic HC were of lower proportion. The carbon number of the pyrolysis oil was noted to increase proportionally with the increasing operating temperature. The gaseous product had a high percentage (> 70%) of C2 to C4 HC, which was attributed to the high activity of carbon/carbon (C-C) chain scission reaction.
