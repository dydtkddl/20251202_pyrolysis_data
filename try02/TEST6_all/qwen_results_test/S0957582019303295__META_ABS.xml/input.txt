Thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a novel fixed bed reactor system for the production of high value gasoline range hydrocarbons (HC) Pyrolysis is a promising thermolysis technique to recover valuable oils and light hydrocarbons (HC) with high yields from plastic solid waste (PSW). In this work, thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with the aim of producing gasoline range hydrocarbon oils, has been carried out in a novel fixed bed (batch) reactor. The pyrolysis of HDPE has been conducted between 500 to 800 °C in the presence of nitrogen as an inert carrier gas media to produce liquid fuel oil, gaseous products and solid char. The optimum temperature of obtaining maximum oil product yield (70%) was 550° C. A comprehensive gas chromatography (GC) analysis of the liquid and gaseous products was conducted to quantify high molecular weight individual HC components. Moreover, light molecular weight HC constituting the gaseous fraction were identified. A chemical kinetic analysis of the cracking reactions, was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of yielding the maximum oil product. The oil product recovered had a high proportion of aliphatic HC especially in the range of C8 to C12, whilst aromatic HC were of lower proportion. The carbon number of the pyrolysis oil was noted to increase proportionally with the increasing operating temperature. The gaseous product had a high percentage (> 70%) of C2 to C4 HC, which was attributed to the high activity of carbon/carbon (C-C) chain scission reaction.
