You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon slow-release and enhanced nitrogen removal performance of plant residue-based composite filler and ecological mechanisms in constructed wetland application Stable carbon release and coupled microbial efficacy of external carbon source solid fillers are the keys to enhanced nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands. The constructed wetland plant residue Acorus calamus was cross-linked with poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) to create composite solid carbon source fillers (Ac-BDPs). The study demonstrated the slow release of carbon sources from Ac-BDPs with 35.27 mg/g under an average release rate of 0.88 mg/(g·d). Excellent denitrification was also observed in constructed wetlands with Ac-BDPs. Moreover, the average removal rate of nitrate nitrogen (NO3 −-N) was increased by 1.94 and 3.85 times of the blank groups under initial NO3 −-N inputs of 5 and 15 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, the relatively high abundances of nap, narG, nirKS, norB, qnorZ and nosZ guaranteed efficient denitrification performance in constructed wetlands with Ac-BDPs. The study introduced a reliable technique for biological nitrogen removal by using composite carbon source fillers in constructed wetlands.
