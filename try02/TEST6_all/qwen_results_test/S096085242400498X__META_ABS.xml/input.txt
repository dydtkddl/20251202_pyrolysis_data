Carbon slow-release and enhanced nitrogen removal performance of plant residue-based composite filler and ecological mechanisms in constructed wetland application Stable carbon release and coupled microbial efficacy of external carbon source solid fillers are the keys to enhanced nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands. The constructed wetland plant residue Acorus calamus was cross-linked with poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) to create composite solid carbon source fillers (Ac-BDPs). The study demonstrated the slow release of carbon sources from Ac-BDPs with 35.27 mg/g under an average release rate of 0.88 mg/(g·d). Excellent denitrification was also observed in constructed wetlands with Ac-BDPs. Moreover, the average removal rate of nitrate nitrogen (NO3 −-N) was increased by 1.94 and 3.85 times of the blank groups under initial NO3 −-N inputs of 5 and 15 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, the relatively high abundances of nap, narG, nirKS, norB, qnorZ and nosZ guaranteed efficient denitrification performance in constructed wetlands with Ac-BDPs. The study introduced a reliable technique for biological nitrogen removal by using composite carbon source fillers in constructed wetlands.
