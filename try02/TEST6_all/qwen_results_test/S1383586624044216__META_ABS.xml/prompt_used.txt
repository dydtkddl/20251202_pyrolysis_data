You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effectively and completely separating the waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules via green solvothermal strategy Crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules currently dominate the market due to their cost-effective and established technology. However, many of these modules are expected to be decommissioned soon. The solar cells within these modules, particularly the silver grid lines, possess considerable recycling value. Nevertheless, the precise layer-by-layer separation of laminated components has proven to be a challenging issue, with the separation and disposal of fluorinated backsheet emerging as a critical challenge in the industry. Here, we propose a solvothermal strategy to effectively separate both sides ofadhesive ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) films, andfluorinated backsheet as well as retrieve the silver grid lines. We demonstrate that immersing the laminates containing the backsheet in anhydrous ethanol at 200 °C for 15 min simultaneously separates the aluminum back electrode and the back EVA film without causing swelling. Further immersing the separated laminates in a 0.3 mol/L aqueous sodium carbonate solution at 200 °C for 120 min enables the effective separation of the silver grid lines and the front EVA film. This method proves to be highly effective and environmentally safe without using harmful organic chemicals. It offers significant advantages over traditional pyrolysis methods in reducing carbon emissions and contributes to the recovery of EVA films, which shows considerable potential to facilitate the development of waste silicon-based PV module recycling.
