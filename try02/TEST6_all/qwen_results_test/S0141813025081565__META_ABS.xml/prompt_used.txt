You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structure-performance relationships in lignin-derived carbon aerogels: the role of subunit composition in electrochemical behavior Carbon aerogels have emerged as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to tunable porous structure and excellent electrochemical property. However, their performance highly depends on both biomass sources and preparation methods. In the present study, three distinct lignins extracted from pine (softwood), poplar (hardwood), and wheat straw (grass) were employed to fabricate lignin-resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon aerogels (LRFCs) via sol-gel polymerization under deep eutectic solvent (DES) system. The lignin chemical structure, molecular weight distribution, and monomeric composition (G/S/H subunits) influencing on both formation kinetics of LRF gels and physicochemical properties of resulting LRFCs were elucidated. Our findings reveal that pine lignin, with dominant G subunits, exhibits superior reaction kinetics for sol-gel processing and enhanced thermal stability compared to poplar (GS-rich) and wheat straw (GSH-containing) lignins. Furthermore, pine LRFC demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a high specific capacitance (197 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), outstanding rate capability, and charge transfer kinetics. This work establishes clear structure-property relationships between lignin subunit composition and resulting LRFC performance, highlighting the advantages of softwood lignin for rapid fabrication of advanced carbon materials with optimized electrochemical properties, and providing valuable guidelines for biomass aimed at high-performance supercapacitors.
