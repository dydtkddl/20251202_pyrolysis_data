You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chitosan-based adsorbents for remediation of toxic dyes from wastewater: A review on adsorption mechanism, reusability, machine learning based modeling and future perspectives The disposal of recalcitrant dyes in aquatic environments from various industrial sectors is a threat to both the plant and animal kingdom. The presence of dyes in various water bodies undermines the availability of uncontaminated drinking water and may result in serious health-related issues and diseases. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to get rid of these harmful dyes from the aquatic environment. Hence various treatment techniques came to the fore, but they have their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. Several researchers have reported the adsorption of dyes with carbon-based composites, polymeric materials, and metal-based nanoparticles. However, the one with biocompatible materials or biopolymers deserves special attention as they are benign from an environmental viewpoint. We have chosen chitosan as our material of interest and elaborated on the positive aspects of chitosan as an excellent candidate for dye adsorption. Although a plethora of review articles has been disseminated in the past to underscore the utilization of chitosan-based adsorbents in the extraction of dyes, this manuscript endeavors to furnish a thorough examination of the complete adsorption process, encompassing its parameters and kinetics, thus facilitating a reader lacking foundational knowledge in this field to attain a more comprehensible understanding of the subject matter. This review also integrates a comprehensive overview of optimization methodologies for dye adsorption and examines relevant patents—an area that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been thoroughly addressed in previous review articles. Conclusively, it can be stated that chitosan can efficiently adsorb dye from wastewater showing good performance even after five cycles of adsorption/desorption. Moreover, several software programs can be used for optimizing maximum dye adsorption capacity of chitosan which shows well alignment with experimental results, thus making it suitable for real-life applications.
