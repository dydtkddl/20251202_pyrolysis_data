You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comparative investigation of biomass co-pyrolysis with polymeric wastes using electromagnetic induction heating In this study, co-pyrolysis of biomass and polymeric wastes has been conducted in an electromagnetic induction (EMI)-heated fixed-bed reactor. The biomass feedstocks were water hyacinth (WH) and vegetable waste (VW), whereas the polymeric wastes were scrap tires (ST) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The maximum liquid yield of 67 wt.% was obtained with a WH/LDPE blend ratio of 30:70, at 450 °C for 50 min and with particle sizes ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm. The calorific value (CV) of the obtained co-pyrolysis oil was determined to be 40.38 MJ/kg. The co-pyrolysis-oil was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The findings demonstrated that the oils had superior properties, such as a higher carbon and hydrogen content, and were mainly composed of aliphatic compounds, such as olefins. The addition of polymeric wastes (LDPE and ST) increased liquid yields even though the oils from VW/ST blends had greater amounts of sulfur and nitrogen. The results showed that the wastes in the study could be transformed into liquid products that could be used as alternatives to petroleum fuels in a variety of ways. It has also been proposed that the liquid product might be a good source of a number of useful chemical compounds.
