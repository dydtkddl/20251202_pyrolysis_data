You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of Box-Behnken design in optimizing product properties of supercritical methanol co-liquefaction of rice straw and linear low-density polyethylene Co-processing of plastic and biomass wastes to produce high-quality fuel has been attracting considerable interest in energy recovery. This work employed Box-Behnken Design (BBD) to optimize yield and properties of oil from supercritical methanol (scMeOH) co-liquefaction of rice straw (RS) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). Three independent variables of reaction temperature (270, 300, and 330°C), holding time (60, 90, and 120 mins), and RS/LLDPE mass ratio (0.15, 0.50, and 0.85) were selected for experiments. A maximum oil yield of 34.17 wt% was achieved at 303°C, 96 mins, and RS/LLDPE ratio of 0.59 according to BBD. Temperature and RS/LLDPE ratio dominated the oil yield and synergistic effects during co-liquefaction, whereas time was an insignificant factor. Optimum oil from co-liquefaction contained substantial hydrocarbons content of 32.91% compared to that from single RS-derived oil of 7.77%. Solid product obtained at the optimum condition could be used as solid fuel, due to its relatively high HHV of 43.08 MJ/kg compared to the other solid fuels (13.90–32.14 MJ/kg). This work provides a deep understanding of the co-processing of solid biomass and plastic wastes.
