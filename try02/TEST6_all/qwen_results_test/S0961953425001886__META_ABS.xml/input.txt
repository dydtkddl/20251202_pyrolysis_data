Microwave-assisted torrefaction of lignocellulosic biomass: A critical review of its role in sustainable energy Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable energy source that can help reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, its raw form presents challenges for practical use. To overcome this, the Microwave-assisted torrefaction (MAT) process has emerged as a successful method for enhancing the quality of biomass and generating energy. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent scientific research on MAT of biomass. It explores torrefaction indices and discusses the impact of key parameters such as biomass composition, temperature, residence time, heating rate, particle size, and microwave power on MAT. The article also addresses potential applications and challenges associated with MAT. Furthermore, it evaluates the hurdles in achieving compatibility, acceptability, and sustainability of the process, along with future directions to realize economic benefits even in small-scale applications. Ultimately, MAT holds promise as an energy-efficient approach to enhance the effectiveness of biomass utilization.
