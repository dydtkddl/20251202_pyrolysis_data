You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction synergy of bimetallic catalysts on ZSM-5 support in tailoring plastic pyrolysis for hydrogen and value-added product production Hydrogen, viz. a green energy carrier, is poised to considerably contribute to the empowerment of a sustainable society. By valorizing plastics, catalytic pyrolysis was envisaged as a promising route to produce green hydrogen and value-added product here. Firstly, the screening of optimal catalyst support (from activated carbon and four zeolites: M-zeolite, B-zeolite, Y-zeolite, ZSM-5) was executed by studying catalytic polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis over supported Ni catalysts. In view of the highest H2 yield (19.2 mmol/gPP) of Ni/ZSM-5, ZSM-5 was put forth as the optimal catalyst support. Then, the identification of optimal active metal (from Ni, Fe, Co, FeNi, FeCo, and NiCo) was performed by running the catalytic PP pyrolysis over ZSM-5 supported catalysts. For catalytic PP pyrolysis, NiCo/ZSM-5 was the optimal catalyst with the highest H2 yield (28.7 mmol/gPP), while the resulting pyrolysis oil demonstrated potential for use as jet fuel. From catalytic pyrolysis of various plastics over NiCo/ZSM-5, polystyrene gave the highest H2 composition (83.2 vol%) of pyrolysis gas and high composition (52.8 area%) of benzocyclobutene (useful chemicals for semiconductor and microelectronics fields) in pyrolysis oil. Lastly, the catalytic mechanism was discussed based on the results, revealing NiCo's remarkable enhancement in H2 yield to 28.7 mmol/g, which surpassed the individual yields of Ni (19.2 mmol/g) and Co (10.2 mmol/g), thereby underscoring the synergistic effect of NiCo. This study supports the recycling of plastics waste into hydrogen energy and valuable products, contributing to environmental pollution mitigation.
