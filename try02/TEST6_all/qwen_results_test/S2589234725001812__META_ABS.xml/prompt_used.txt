You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transition metal based spinel ferrites: a review Ferrite materials have attracted significant attention due to their tunable structural and magnetic properties, making them highly promising for modern technological applications. Transition metals play a crucial role in spinel ferrites, serving either as dopants or as primary divalent cations, and thus strongly influence their performance. Despite extensive studies, a systematic framework that links transition-metal incorporation to magnetic applications using modern synthesis methods and combined structural and magnetic property analysis is still limited. This review highlights several modern synthesis methodologies and emphasizes the relationship between structural and magnetic properties of transition-metal spinel ferrites, drawing insights from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Structural parameters, such as lattice constant, crystallite size, dislocation density, unit cell volume, and hopping length, provide insight into structural stability, bond geometry, and structural ordering. Similarly, magnetic parameters, including remanent and saturation magnetization, squareness ratio, coercivity, magnetic moment, and anisotropy, reflect domain stability, magnetic domain structure, and magnetic ordering. Reduced structural stability and altered bond geometry generally favor soft magnetic states (superparamagnetic, paramagnetic, diamagnetic, antiferromagnetic), whereas enhanced stability supports hard magnetic states (ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic). Notably, transition-metal doping improves both structural and magnetic properties, broadening the potential of spinel ferrites for next-generation technological applications.
