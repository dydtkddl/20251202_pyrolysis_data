You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress, prospects, and challenges in standardization of sampling and analysis of micro- and nano-plastics in the environment To date, accurate quantification of micro- and nano-plastics (MPs and NPs) has become the need of the hour to efficiently maintain the planetary sustainability and human health in light of their potentials for the environmental perturbation. However, the analysis of MPs and NPs is impeded by the lack of standardized methods with the shortage of the knowledge on chemical composition (e.g., molecular weight) of plastic polymers and on the interactive roles between physico-chemical, biological (e.g., plastic-microbe interactions), and environmental attributes. Also, the gap between accurate quantitative analysis of plastic particles and the health hazards is huge. As such, standardized analytical protocols for these hazardous plastic particles, if established, would help monitor their behavior to safely manage the human health. In this work, critical analysis on the current status, issues, and challenges for future development in the monitoring of MPs and NPs is presented with an emphasis on monitoring of plastic particles in terrestrial (soil/sediment), atmosphere (air), aquatic (marine and freshwater), and biotic systems (model organisms and food webs). Further, an in-depth discussion on multiple methodological approaches for sampling, sample treatment, and preparation (e.g., separation, extraction, and digestion), and analysis (identification, detection, and characterization) of MPs and NPs has been made. The benefits and drawbacks of these approaches are also described to help open the new paths for the efficient monitoring of plastics in various environmental systems. At last, the adequate quality assurance/control measures are to be emphasized to help overcome the multifaceted challenges in plastic analysis.
