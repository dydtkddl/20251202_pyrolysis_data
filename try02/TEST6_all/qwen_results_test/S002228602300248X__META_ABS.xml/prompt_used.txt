You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation methods of different nanomaterials for various potential applications: A review Nanomaterials are an interesting class of materials that include a wide variety of samples with at least one dimension between 1 and 100 nm. Nanomaterials are cornerstones of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Controlling the size, shape, and composition of the nanomaterials is an uphill task and have a profound impact on their performance. Along with potential health and safety risks, producing large quantities of high-quality nanomaterials are challenging and expensive. The synthesis and growth process of nanostructures and nanomaterials is one of the key elements in the utilization of nanomaterials and their applications in several sectors. The morphology and structure of nanomaterials depend also on the method used for synthesis and growth. This review discusses the various nanomaterial synthesis methods which are categorized into two main types bottom-up methods and top-down approaches depending on starting precursors of nanoparticle generation. Both approaches are critically discussed, in addition, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique have been reported. The aforementioned approaches can have a potential technological applications, such as nano-molecular electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, energy storage materials, composite materials, nano-biotechnology, nano-medicine, etc.
