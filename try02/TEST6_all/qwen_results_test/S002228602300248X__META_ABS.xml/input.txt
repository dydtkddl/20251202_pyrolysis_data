Preparation methods of different nanomaterials for various potential applications: A review Nanomaterials are an interesting class of materials that include a wide variety of samples with at least one dimension between 1 and 100 nm. Nanomaterials are cornerstones of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Controlling the size, shape, and composition of the nanomaterials is an uphill task and have a profound impact on their performance. Along with potential health and safety risks, producing large quantities of high-quality nanomaterials are challenging and expensive. The synthesis and growth process of nanostructures and nanomaterials is one of the key elements in the utilization of nanomaterials and their applications in several sectors. The morphology and structure of nanomaterials depend also on the method used for synthesis and growth. This review discusses the various nanomaterial synthesis methods which are categorized into two main types bottom-up methods and top-down approaches depending on starting precursors of nanoparticle generation. Both approaches are critically discussed, in addition, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique have been reported. The aforementioned approaches can have a potential technological applications, such as nano-molecular electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, energy storage materials, composite materials, nano-biotechnology, nano-medicine, etc.
