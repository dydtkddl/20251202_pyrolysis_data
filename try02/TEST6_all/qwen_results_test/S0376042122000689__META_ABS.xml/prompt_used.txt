You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advancements in sustainable aviation fuels Sustainable alternative fuels, or SAFs, are recognized to have lower carbon footprints and emit fewer greenhouse emissions. As a carbon-neutral alternative and intended drop-in fuels, SAFs would be an appropriate path forward for sustainable aviation. Current approved drop-in fuels enable 50% blending of SAFs, which decreases CO2 emissions up to 40%. However, CO2 emissions can be reduced much further by using 100% SAFs or hydrogen. Comprehensive analysis of SAFs in terms of their operational performance, impact on gaseous and particulate emissions, seal swell, engine and fuel systems compatibility, blow-off limits, ignition and relight, vibrations, and noise is essential to move towards 100% SAFs. Furthermore, SAF has been demonstrated to reduce other emissions like NOx, particulate and CO2 emissions subjective to the fuel production pathways. Therefore, engineering novel fuels and innovative production pathways may lower emissions and reduce the costs of aircraft system design and operation, resulting in cheaper air travel. This study thoroughly examined and discussed all the aspects mentioned above. Hydrogen, a potential competitor for SAFs, has also been analyzed in this study in terms of future production capability to meet aviation needs and the impact of hydrogen combustion on design changes, emissions, and fuel systems. Furthermore, to reduce experimental costs related to SAFs, this study explored approaches for modeling and predicting novel fuel performance in the preliminary stages of fuel assessment.
