You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Maturation study of vitrinite in carbonaceous shales and coals: Insights from hydrous pyrolysis The presence of vitrinite in sedimentary rocks of post-Silurian age allows its reflectance to be used to estimate the thermal maturation of organic matter in petroleum systems. Increasing reflectance of vitrinite, which is primarily driven by aromaticity, depends primarily on the time and temperature attributes of its evolutionary pathway. This study evaluated carbonaceous shales proximal to coal measures and coal samples via isothermal hydrous pyrolysis (HP) to compare differences in the maturation pathways of vitrinite. Sample residues were analysed via vitrinite reflectance (VRo), geochemical screening tests (organic carbon and programmed temperature pyrolysis), and infrared spectroscopy. The study included samples from Indian and North American basins, to observe differences in vitrinite evolution with respect to enclosing mineral matrix, starting degree of aromaticity, organic matter types, stratigraphic age, and depositional environment. The organic content of HP residues shows an intuitive response to the thermal stress of HP, e.g., a general depletion of total organic carbon (TOC) content, pyrolyzate (S2), and hydrogen index with increasing HP temperature. Infrared proxies including C-factor and CH2/CH3 generally decrease with increasing thermal maturity indicating loss of O via CO2 generation and the thermal cracking of aliphatic organic matter. Tmax, production index (PI), and VRo show intuitive increasing values with respect to HP temperature. The least mature sample (0.48 ± 0.05% VRo) generally experienced the maximum change in these parameters during maturation, whereas the most mature sample (0.99 ± 0.06% VRo) generally showed the least change. This observation is consistent with higher kinetic barriers to reaction in more aromatic vitrinite which contains higher bond dissociation energies. Devolatilization of vitrinite during HP causes formation of gas evacuation vacuoles and contraction cracks in the vitrinite grains of both coal and carbonaceous shale. Similarities in vitrinite response to HP between coal and carbonaceous shale suggest that thermal evolution of the vitrinite maceral is principally controlled by inherent rate-limiting kinetic parameters related to its molecular structure. Whereas, the stratigraphic age, sedimentary environment, surrounding organic matter, lithology, and catalysis by mineral composition have less effect. To further improve our understanding of vitrinite aromatization and kinetic parameters, future studies of vitrinite reflectance thermal evolution with temperature should include coal and carbonaceous shale from the same stratigraphic section and extant woody tissue from modern vascular plants.
