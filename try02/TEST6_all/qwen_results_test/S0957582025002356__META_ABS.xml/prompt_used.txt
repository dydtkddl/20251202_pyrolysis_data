You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly selective production of aromatics via co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and polypropylene in binary molten chlorides combined with commercial HZSM-5 catalysts Biomass catalytic pyrolysis for the production of aromatics as an alternative to petrochemical resources is a promising technology in the context of carbon neutrality. The aromatization of furans presents a novel pathway for converting biomass into aromatics. In this study, four binary molten chlorides (NaCl-FeCl2, NaCl-MnCl2, NaCl-ZnCl2, and NaCl-MgCl2) were selected for the pyrolysis of pine sawdust. The thermal stability and eutectic points of the binary molten chlorides were tested by TG-DSC. The introduction of binary molten chlorides significantly increased the selectivity for furans in bio-oil, reaching 72.2–91.8 area% for NaCl-ZnCl2 and 42.8–71.2 area% for NaCl-FeCl2. Commercial HZSM-5 was characterized by SEM, XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, and Py-IR, and HZSM-5/cordierite monolithic catalysts were prepared. Co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and polypropylene in binary molten chlorides were conducted, combined with in-situ or ex-situ catalytic processes. Furans generated from the pyrolysis of pine sawdust in binary molten chlorides served as key intermediates for the production of aromatics with high selectivity in a single step. In ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis, the highest selectivity for aromatics reached 91.2 area%. The van Krevelen diagram indicated that the aromatics from bio-oil had the potential to substitute ethylene tar in carbon black production. Diels–Alder reactions were discussed in the proposed reaction pathways for catalytic co-pyrolysis.
