Laser powered homogeneous decomposition of methyl acrylate and methacrylate The continuous wave CO2 laser-powered decomposition of methyl acrylate and methacrylate sensitized by sulfur hexafluoride was examined in order to determine the course of reaction in the absence of wall effects. The reactions are dominated by acyl-oxygen cleavage and have radical-chain mechanism.
