You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Depolymerization of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) into bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate: Catalytic glycolysis mechanism and kinetics Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) does not readily degrade in nature, leading to the accumulation of large quantities of PET waste in the ecosystem, posing a threat to both terrestrial and aquatic life. Consequently, proper recycling of post-consumer PET has become imperative for our society. This review focuses on PET glycolysis, emphasizing its associated mechanisms and kinetics. The degradation mechanisms are systematically summarized from the perspectives of homogeneous, pseudohomogeneous, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Homogeneous catalysts demonstrate effective degradation but lack environmental friendliness, and are challenging to separate from the product for subsequent reuse. Conversely, pseudohomogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts offer greater stability and recyclability, rendering them advantageous for sustainable industrial-scale production. Moreover, this review surveys kinetic studies of PET glycolysis, categorizing them into homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. A comprehensive understanding of the kinetic modeling of various degradation processes is deemed essential for the design of efficient glycolytic reaction systems in the future.
