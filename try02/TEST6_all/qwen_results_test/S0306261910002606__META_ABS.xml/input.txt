Characteristics of syngas from co-gasification of polyethylene and woodchips Gasification of polyethylene (PE) and woodchips (WC) mixtures have been investigated in a semi-batch reactor, using high temperature steam as the gasifying agent. The reactor temperature was maintained at 900°C. The ratio of PE–WC was varied from 0% to 100% in 20% intervals. Characteristics of syngas were evaluated based on the yield of syngas, hydrogen, energy, ethylene, total hydrocarbons and apparent thermal efficiency of the process. Results show that properties of syngas evolved during gasification of PE–WC blends cannot be determined from the weighted average syngas properties obtained from separate gasification of WC and PE. Superior results in terms of syngas yield, hydrogen yield, total hydrocarbons yield, energy yield and apparent thermal efficiency from PE–WC blends were obtained as compared to expected weighed average yields from gasification of individual components. Results confirm synergistic interaction between PE and WC during high temperature steam gasification of these mixtures. These results also provide the importance of mixing two or more compounds on the performance of stream gasification of wastes.
