You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution of mechanical, optical and electrical properties of self-assembled mesostructured phenolic resins during carbonization Ordered mesoporous polymer and carbon films are synthesized through the cooperative self-assembly of a phenol–formaldehyde resin with an amphiphilic block copolymer template, Pluronic F127. The processing temperature at which the template is removed and the resin is pyrolyzed dramatically impacts the mechanical, electrical and optical properties of the mesoporous film. There is a substantial increase in the hardness, modulus, conductivity and refractive index of the films as the pyrolysis temperature is increased from 400 to 800°C. Upon further increasing the temperature to 1000°C, there is no statistical change in the mechanical properties of the porous film, although the conductivity increases significantly from 18 to 74S/cm. The modulus and hardness of the near surface are larger compared to the bulk of the film; this difference is more pronounced for the highly conductive films (carbonized at 800 and 1000°C) and suggests a denser surface, which is consistent with low porosity calculated from ellipsometric porosimetry measurements that are surface sensitive. This work illustrates how the mechanical and electrical properties of mesoporous carbon films change with pyrolysis temperature. These mechanical and electronic properties are critical to the utility of these films in electronic or electrochemical applications.
