You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plantwide Simulation and Operation of a Methanol to Propylene (MTP) Process Background Methanol to propylene (MTP) process is considered as one of the most important methods for propylene production. The MTP process consists of four sections: conversion of reactants to products, cooling, compression and products separation. In this process, is utilized from multi-stage fixed bed reactors. Due to high exothermicity of the MTP reactors, and existence of recycle loops, a plant-wide control structure is required to be designed for stable, safe and maximum production of propylene. Method Modeling and simulation of the heterogeneous fixed bed MTP reactors with interphase and intra-particle mass and heat transfer were carried out in Aspen Custom Modeler. Steady-state simulations of the MTP process were carried out in Aspen Plus. A simple control strategy was proposed to achieve maximum propylene production with temperature control of the MTP multi-stage reactors by splitting the cold oxygenate feed and the recycled hydrocarbons among the reactor beds. The performance of the proposed control strategy was tested against several disturbances including change in flowrate and composition of feed, using dynamic simulations by Aspen Plus Dynamics. Significant finding Dynamic simulation results revealed that simultaneous control of the split range for the 5th and 6th reactor beds and cascade temperature of other reactor beds, could be a suitable temperature control strategy for the reaction section of the MTP process.
