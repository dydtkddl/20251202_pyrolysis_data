Plantwide Simulation and Operation of a Methanol to Propylene (MTP) Process Background Methanol to propylene (MTP) process is considered as one of the most important methods for propylene production. The MTP process consists of four sections: conversion of reactants to products, cooling, compression and products separation. In this process, is utilized from multi-stage fixed bed reactors. Due to high exothermicity of the MTP reactors, and existence of recycle loops, a plant-wide control structure is required to be designed for stable, safe and maximum production of propylene. Method Modeling and simulation of the heterogeneous fixed bed MTP reactors with interphase and intra-particle mass and heat transfer were carried out in Aspen Custom Modeler. Steady-state simulations of the MTP process were carried out in Aspen Plus. A simple control strategy was proposed to achieve maximum propylene production with temperature control of the MTP multi-stage reactors by splitting the cold oxygenate feed and the recycled hydrocarbons among the reactor beds. The performance of the proposed control strategy was tested against several disturbances including change in flowrate and composition of feed, using dynamic simulations by Aspen Plus Dynamics. Significant finding Dynamic simulation results revealed that simultaneous control of the split range for the 5th and 6th reactor beds and cascade temperature of other reactor beds, could be a suitable temperature control strategy for the reaction section of the MTP process.
