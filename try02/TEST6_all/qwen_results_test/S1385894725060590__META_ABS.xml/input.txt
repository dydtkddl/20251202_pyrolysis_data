Microreactors in chemical process intensification: Chemical reactions, crystallizations, extractions and emulsifications Microreactor technology has demonstrated remarkable advantages in critical processes (including reactions, crystallization, extraction, and emulsification) across chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries due to its high surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced mass/heat transfer efficiency, and precise process control. This review systematically classifies microreactor architectures (capillary, microchip, falling-film, porous, and external-field enhanced types) and elucidates their roles in enhancing reaction kinetics, enabling accurate temperature regulation, facilitating high-throughput screening, and optimizing process parameters. Comparative analysis with conventional batch processes highlights their technological advancements and superiorities. Nevertheless, challenges persist in high-cost fabrication of intricate structures and unclear scale-up principles for multiphase systems. Future development priorities encompass three directions: advanced functional materials, process optimization via online monitoring and machine learning, and cross-scale system integration, collectively driving the transition from lab-scale prototypes to 10,000-ton-level industrial production. This work pioneers a comprehensive framework that integrates multi-process advantages of microreactors, transcending conventional single-function or single-domain analysis paradigms, thereby providing theoretical foundations and technical roadmaps for interdisciplinary applications.
