You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microreactors in chemical process intensification: Chemical reactions, crystallizations, extractions and emulsifications Microreactor technology has demonstrated remarkable advantages in critical processes (including reactions, crystallization, extraction, and emulsification) across chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries due to its high surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced mass/heat transfer efficiency, and precise process control. This review systematically classifies microreactor architectures (capillary, microchip, falling-film, porous, and external-field enhanced types) and elucidates their roles in enhancing reaction kinetics, enabling accurate temperature regulation, facilitating high-throughput screening, and optimizing process parameters. Comparative analysis with conventional batch processes highlights their technological advancements and superiorities. Nevertheless, challenges persist in high-cost fabrication of intricate structures and unclear scale-up principles for multiphase systems. Future development priorities encompass three directions: advanced functional materials, process optimization via online monitoring and machine learning, and cross-scale system integration, collectively driving the transition from lab-scale prototypes to 10,000-ton-level industrial production. This work pioneers a comprehensive framework that integrates multi-process advantages of microreactors, transcending conventional single-function or single-domain analysis paradigms, thereby providing theoretical foundations and technical roadmaps for interdisciplinary applications.
