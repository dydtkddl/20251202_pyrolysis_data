You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Correlation between the as-grown carbon nano tubes and prolonged activity toward hydrogen production over Co–Mo/MgO Novel proposal for the developed highly graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) over Co–Mo/MgO which served as a secondary support toward hydrogen production from low-density polyethylene waste (PE) was presented using two-stage system. Doping of Co3O4 with MoO3 into MgO exposed extra dispersion function through MoO3 and Co, Mo and MgO mixed oxides as well as further distribution of the active cobalt nano particles over the well graphitized thinner MWCNTs. Both of fresh and used Co/MgO and CoMo/MgO catalysts were characterized by XRD, TPR, Raman, TEM and TGA. Furthermore, the concentrations of released hydrogen through the reaction period were detected via online gas chromatography within 150 min. It was found that Mo improved the overall catalyst reducibility to be easier and distributed the active species in different forms of mixed species. Moreover, the catalytic performance toward hydrogen production from low density polyethylene waste was jumped from 51% to 81% after Mo addition within the reaction end. Also, full catalytically action was noticed for CoMo/MgO toward whole the charged hydrocarbon gases from the first decomposition stage without any deactivation. Additionally, the developed multi-walled carbon nanotubes were highly graphitized and more homogenous rather than over Co/MgO which deposited less graphitized carbon nano fibers.
