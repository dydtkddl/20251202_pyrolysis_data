Graphitic carbon nitride-based photocatalysts and sonocatalysts for energy and environment Transforming solar energy into secondary energy forms through photochemical processes has emerged as a viable strategy for addressing contemporary energy challenges. Within this framework, photocatalytic systems facilitate energy conversion through light-matter interactions, yet their practical applications are constrained by low conversion efficiency. Notably, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted extensive attention as a metal-free photocatalyst, driving innovation in semiconductor science by effectively harvesting solar photons and converting their energy into chemically storable forms. Its excellent thermal and chemical stability, together with its environmentally benign nature, supports diverse photocatalytic applications, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, antibiotic decomposition, NOx conversion, nitrogen fixation, bacterial disinfection, heavy metal reduction, and organic synthesis. In recent years, a series of representative breakthroughs have been achieved, such as doping strategies to modulate electronic structures, heterojunction construction such as S-scheme heterojunction to enhance charge separation, and cocatalyst loading to accelerate interfacial reactions. These advances have greatly improved the visible-light absorption capacity, charge transfer efficiency, and catalytic selectivity of g-C3N4-based systems. Furthermore, g-C3N4-based sonocatalysis and photo-sonocatalysis offer innovative approaches by synergistically utilizing light and ultrasound, thereby enabling more efficient energy utilization and advanced pollutant degradation. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in g-C3N4-based photocatalysis and sonocatalysis, with emphasis on synthesis strategies, modification methods, catalytic mechanisms, and cutting-edge applications in energy conversion and environmental purification. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for advancing g-C3N4-based systems toward sustainable energy and environmental solutions are discussed.
