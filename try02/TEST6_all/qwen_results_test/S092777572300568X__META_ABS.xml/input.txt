Ultra-sensitive Baicalin electrochemical sensor based on γ-cyclodextrin supramole derived N,Zn double-doped carbon nanosphere Baicalin (Bn) is the main component of the Chinese patent medicine Baicalin Tablet which is used for the auxiliary treatment of acute, chronic hepatitis and persistent hepatitis. Herein, an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor was manufactured based on the nitrogen and zinc double doped carbon nanospheres(ZnN-CNS) derived from γ-cyclodextrin self-assembled supermolecules with ZnCl2. The sensing nanomaterials were characterized and investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), raman spectroscopy (RS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), etc. Under the optimized optimal environment, the linear detection range of the prepared sensor for Bn was ranged from 1 × 10−8 to 7.5 × 10−7 M, where the LOD was 7.17 × 10−8 M with a sensitivity of 220 A/M. Good accuracy and desirable recovery results for the detection of Bn in real samples (Bear bile scutellaria eye drops and Shuanghuanglian oral liquid) were also observed. This work provides a new idea about the detection of Bn as well as the application of novel binary doped carbon materials.
