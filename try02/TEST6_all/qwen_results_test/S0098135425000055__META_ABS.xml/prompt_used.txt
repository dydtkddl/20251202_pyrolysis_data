You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process design for plastic waste pyrolysis: Yield analysis and economic assessment The widespread use of plastic products and inadequate waste management systems have rendered plastic waste a major source of environmental pollution, thereby necessitating effective plastic recycling methods. In this study, we propose two pyrolysis processes for recycling plastic waste using Aspen Plus: a base process and an alternative process. The main difference lies in the condensation and separation methods used to produce pyrolysis oil. In the base process, condensation is carried out using a cooler, followed by decomposition with a flash drum. In contrast, the alternative process utilizes a distillation column for both condensation and separation. The results showed that PS achieved the highest oil yield of 81.3 %, while PS/PE exhibited the greatest improvement, with a 27.34 % increase in oil production yield in the alternative process compared to the base process. However, the alternative process incurs higher operating and capital costs due to the precise control requirements, particularly for feedstocks like PS/PE/PP/PET, which had the highest energy production cost at 31.07×10 −4 $/ MJ compared to 27.85×10 −4 $/ MJ in the base process. Despite these higher costs, the alternative process significantly improved oil production, especially for plastics such as PS and PS/PE. These findings underscore the importance of selecting pyrolysis processes based on feedstock composition and specific recycling goals, highlighting the trade-off between higher yields and increased energy production costs and emphasizing the need for balance.
