You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treatment advances of hazardous solid wastes from oil and gas drilling and production processes With the continuous advancement of oil exploration and production, the generation of oil-contaminated drill cuttings (OCDC) and oily sludge (OS) has reached alarming levels. These hazardous wastes, laden with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and heavy metals (HMs), pose severe and escalating threats to environmental and human health, underscoring the urgent need for effective waste treatment and management solutions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the treatment methods and technologies for hazardous solid wastes generated during petroleum drilling and production, employing a literature review and comparative analysis to systematically evaluate and summarize existing waste treatment technologies. Additionally, key information from various studies is summarized and a brief evaluation of each technology is provided to assist readers in making appropriate choices based on operating conditions. The following summaries and prospects are proposed: (i) Cooperation between industry and academic institutions should be strengthened, and further developing drilling fluids that combine high performance with environmental friendliness. (ii) Designing hybrid treatment processes that integrate multiple treatment technologies, determining synergistic effects between technologies can enhance treatment efficiency. (iii) Clear and up-to-date end-of-waste criteria (EWC) should be established, considering circular economy principles, promoting the rational use of resources. (iv) Future research should detail the specific properties of waste samples to facilitate the selection of appropriate treatment approaches based on waste characteristics. (v) Combining EWC and life cycle assessment (LCA) can optimize overall waste management, improve resource utilization, and reduce environmental pollution. (vi) A CERCLA-like database for OS and OCDC should be established to support advanced analytics, leading to more efficient and sustainable treatment strategies, and facilitating the application of LCA and EWC.
