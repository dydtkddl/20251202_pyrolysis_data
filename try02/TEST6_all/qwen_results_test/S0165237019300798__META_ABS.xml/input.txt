Thermal decomposition of CuProp2: In-situ analysis of film and powder pyrolysis The thermal decomposition of CuProp2 in the form of film and powder was studied in different atmospheres by means of thermal analysis techniques (TG-MS, TG-IR, EGA), chemical-structural methods (FTIR, XRD, EA) and computational thermochemistry (VASP/PBE). The decomposition mechanism in terms of volatiles evolved was disclosed with the aid of ab-initio modeling; it was found to be dependent on the gas diffusion in and out of the sample and accelerated by a humid atmosphere. In films, the copper redox behavior showed sensitivity to the residual atmosphere. Finally, the role of the metal center is discussed in the frame of a general decomposition mechanism for metal propionates.
