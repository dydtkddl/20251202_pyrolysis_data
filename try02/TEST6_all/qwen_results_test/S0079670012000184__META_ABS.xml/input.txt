Modifications of carbon for polymer composites and nanocomposites The various forms of carbon used in composite preparation include mainly carbon-black, carbon nanotubes and nanofibers, graphite and fullerenes. This review presents a detailed literature survey on the various modifications of the carbon nanostructures for nanocomposite preparation focusing upon the works published in the last decade. The modifications of each form of carbon are considered, with a compilation of structure–property relationships of carbon-based polymer nanocomposites. Modifications in both bulk and surface modifications have been reviewed, with comparison of their mechanical, thermal, electrical and barrier properties. A synopsis of the applications of these advanced materials is presented, pointing out gaps to motivate potential research in this field.
