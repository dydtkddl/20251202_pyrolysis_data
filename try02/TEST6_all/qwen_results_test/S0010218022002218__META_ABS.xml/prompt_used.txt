You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An experimental and kinetic modeling study of the pyrolysis of isoprene, a significant biogenic hydrocarbon in naturally occurring vegetation fires Isoprene dominates the carbon flux emitted by vegetation and constitutes 40% of non-methane biogenic emissions worldwide. Despite pyrolysis experiments at temperatures above 1000 K showing a link between isoprene combustion and aromatic species formation, comprehensive mechanistic research on isoprene is scarce in the literature. In this work, we carry out an experimental and theoretical study to build, for the first time, a chemical kinetic model describing isoprene pyrolysis. The formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) precursor species, often observed in vegetation fire plumes, is partially explained by isoprene pyrolysis experiments and theoretical modeling. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations unveil reaction pathways from allylic isoprenyl radicals to allene and cyclopentadiene (CPD) intermediates, two relevant species detected in the experiments. Rate constants for these identified pathways are calculated using variational transition state theory to update the kinetic model, which is validated against single-pulse shock tube (SPST), and jet-stirred reactor (JSR) experimental data in the temperature range of 850–1690 K. The kinetic model presents satisfactory agreement with the SPST experimental data, and a reaction pathway analysis shows that association of propargyl radicals results in benzene formation. The JSR pathway analysis also identifies the prominent reactions for CPD, benzene, styrene, and toluene formation. Our model does not reproduce the CPD experimental profiles, indicating that additional studies are necessary. Overall, our findings advance the understanding of isoprene pyrolysis and its related atmospheric pollutants in naturally occurring vegetation fires where smoldering and oxygen-deficient combustion processes are present.
