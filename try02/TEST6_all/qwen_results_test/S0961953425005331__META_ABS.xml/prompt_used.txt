You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical processing of organic wastes for sustainable valorisation and energy recovery: A review of recent contributions to the field This paper reviews the current knowledge on the thermochemical processing of organic waste for sustainable valorisation and presents its impacts on energy recovery. We focused on novel, low-cost, and highly efficient thermochemical methods for converting organic waste into energy. Thermochemical processes for waste management are reported as sustainable alternatives for energy recovery, while generating other by-products for various applications. Thermochemical methods include hydrothermal processes, pyrolysis, and gasification. Additionally, torrefaction has been extensively studied in recent years for the pre-treatment of feedstock. Combustion and incineration are not discussed in this review, as conversion of carbon-rich feedstock into energy and valuable chemicals through gasification has several advantages over them. Recent contributions in this field have focused on enhancing the specificity of thermochemical processes for the sustainable valorisation of organic waste into high-value products. Waste valorisation fulfils the concept of biorefineries and the use of renewable energy, which helps attain the Sustainable Development Goals. Since thermochemical processing offers excellent opportunities to transform waste into valuable resources, this review paper will also highlight these crucial aspects within the concept of circular bioeconomy.
