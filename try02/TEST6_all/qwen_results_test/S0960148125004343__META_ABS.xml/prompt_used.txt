You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable H2-rich bio-syngas production from high moisture wastes: Steam gasification of hydrochars obtained from apple pomace in single and binary solvent systems Innovative solutions dedicated to valorization of high moisture content wastes into perspective groups of products like hydrocarbons or hydrogen are sought. Herein, we propose a two-stage processing route involving hydrothermal processing of apple pomace (AP) with the subsequent steam gasification. AP was converted into hydrochar using either a single solvent (water or ethanol) or a binary solvent (water mixed with ethanol). The effect of the medium type on the change in the yield and quality of the resultant hydrochar was studied, including comprehensive characterization. The subsequent step was to upgrade the resultant hydrochars through steam gasification at 900 °C. A noticeable influence of the application of a type of solvent medium on the conversion level of the pristine structure, as well as on the effectiveness of steam gasification, was noted. Syngas included hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, with hydrogen being the dominant component (56–60 %). The high share of methane in bio-syngas translates into a relatively high energy potential of the residual gas after possible hydrogen separation. The aqueous system produced the most reactive and high-yielding hydrochar, while the ethanol system exhibited the lowest values due to differences in porous structure, elemental composition, and structure of surface functional groups.
