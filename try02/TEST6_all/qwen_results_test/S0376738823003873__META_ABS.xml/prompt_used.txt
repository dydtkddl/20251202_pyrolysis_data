You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon molecular-sieve membranes developed from a Tröger’s base polymer and possessing superior gas-separation performance Carbon molecular-sieve membranes possess tremendous practical advantages over unary polymer membranes by providing high gas-separation performance levels, coupled with excellent mechanical and chemical stability. Improving their overall effectiveness greatly expands the competitiveness of this class of membranes. In the present study, carbon membranes are fabricated from a Tröger’s base polymer as the precursor. By optimizing the carbonization conditions, the gas-separation performance of the resultant membranes are significantly enhanced. Under optimized conditions, a H2 permeability of up to 1135 Barrer is achieved, with a corresponding H2/CH4 selectivity of 1170 and a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 238. While increasing the operating temperature slightly reduces the selectivity, it still remains in the high-separation region. Overall, the measured separation performance levels for H2-related separations, i.e., H2/CH4, H2/N2 and H2/CO2, all substantially exceed the Robeson upper bound. Moreover, the CO2/CH4 separation efficacy also lies above the 2019 upper bound, indicating that the carbon membranes developed in the present work are versatile and promising for many different gas-separation applications.
