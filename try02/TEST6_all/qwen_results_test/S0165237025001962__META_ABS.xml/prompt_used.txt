You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of waste wind turbine blades in a molten polyolefin medium This study investigates the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes of waste wind turbine blades (WWTB) and polyolefins (POs) at 450 °C in a round bottom tank reactor. The study contains three experimental sets: 1) batch pyrolysis of POs; 2) continuous pyrolysis of WWTB; 3) continuous feeding of WWTB into a molten PO medium, which was previously fed to the round bottom tank reactor batch-wise. Individual WWTB pyrolysis yields a modest 18.7 wt% of liquid, predominantly influenced by elevated ash and fixed carbon content. Conversely, co-pyrolysis demonstrates positive synergies, with escalating polyolefin content boosting liquid yields, reaching a peak at 61.5 wt% with a WWTB:POs mixture (25:75, wt%), while concurrently suppressing gas production to 21.6 wt%. The primary chemical groups found in the liquid obtained from WWTB are phenol and phenolic compounds, with their abundance diminishing as the POs ratio in feedstocks increases. Analysis of non-condensable gases from WWTB reveals that approximately 57.7 wt% are oxygen-containing, predominantly CO and CO2. Co-pyrolysis with POs at a 25:75 (wt%) ratio yields 47.1 wt% C3H6, resembling POs pyrolysis. The resulting solid products are rich in carbon and contains high ash. This research not only offers a detailed product analysis of WWTB but also sheds light on the dynamics of its co-pyrolysis with POs. Doing so contributes crucial insights into the transformative potential of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes, covering the way for sustainable waste-to-resource solutions.
