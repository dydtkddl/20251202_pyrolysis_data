A review of collector and energy storage technology for intermediate temperature applications The technology and thermal performance of intermediate temperature solar collectors is summarized and the status of thermal and thermo-chemical storage methods is reviewed. It is concluded that collector technology is commercially available to achieve delivery temperatures up to 350°F at averaged yearly efficiencies better than 30 per cent in good solar climates and that linear parabolic, single-axis tracking troughs are the best types of collectors currently available for intermediate temperature applications. On the other hand, energy storage options commercially available today are generally limited to sensible heat systems, which are bulky and expensive for long-term storage. More research is necessary to develop new storage concepts, such as intermediate temperature chemical heat pumps based on reversible reactions, suitable for intermediate temperature solar systems with significant storage capability.
