You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries using coaxial electrospun hollow N-doped carbon nanofibers decorated with NiCo and CoMn nanocrystals Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have garnered significant attention as ideal power sources for wearable electronic devices. However, the slow reaction kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain a major obstacle to their widespread application. Herein, coaxial electrospinning followed by carbonization is utilized to synthesize hollow N-doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The inner surface of these CNFs is decorated with OER-active NiCo nanoparticles, while the outside surface is modified with ORR-active CoMn nanocrystals. The resulting NiCo@C@CoMn CNFs exhibit excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performance, with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.82 V and an OER overpotential of 398 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Batteries assembled with this catalyst demonstrate an open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V, a power density of 130.3 mW cm−2, a specific capacity of 798.4 mAh g−1, and a cycle life of 1650 h. Additionally, solid-state ZABs based on NiCo@C@CoMn CNFs show a high open-circuit voltage of 1.41 V, a power density of 91.5 mW cm−2 and a cycle life of 30 h. This approach provides a novel strategy for synthesizing high-performance electrocatalysts with bifunctional catalytic properties.
