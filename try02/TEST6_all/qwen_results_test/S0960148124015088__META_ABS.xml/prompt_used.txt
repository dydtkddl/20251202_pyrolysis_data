You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study of grass pyrolysis over regenerated catalysts: Tyre ash, zeolite, and nickel-supported ash and zeolite This paper presents investigations on catalytic and non-catalytic grass pyrolysis conducted at 500 °C using two reactor scales: a micro-scale reactor and a laboratory fixed-bed reactor. Four catalysts were employed in the catalytic pyrolysis process: car tyre ash, commercial zeolite mordenite-sodium, nickel supported on ash, and nickel supported on zeolite. The use of catalysts reduced the production of oxygenates and promoted the formation of gaseous compounds, with the most pronounced effect observed for nickel supported on zeolite. Catalytic pyrolysis produced chars with yields that were higher than those of the non-catalytic process. The coking behaviour of the spent catalysts was evaluated by analysing carbon content, with the highest content (3 wt% C) obtained for ash after the first cycle. In the second cycle, the deposited carbon content decreased for all catalysts. Furthermore, the employment of catalysts was shown to promote the production of hydrogen, methane, and other hydrocarbons in pyrolysis gas. The higher heating value of the pyrolysis gas was the highest at 21.1 MJ/m³ when the ash catalyst was first used for pyrolysis. Reusing the pyrolysis catalysts slightly reduced the heating value of the gas to 20.3 MJ/m³ over ash and 20.6 MJ/m³ over zeolite.
