You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring the synergistic promoting effect of core-shell energetic composite EC-Pb@CA on ammonium perchlorate thermolysis In this paper, using 1,3-bis(5-tetrazolyl)triazene (H3BTT, N% = 85) as energetic ligand, a new lead-based energetic complex {[Pb2(HBTT)2(H2O)7]·H2O}n (EC-Pb) was synthesized under hydrothermal condition. Its crystal structure, thermal decomposition behavior, theoretical detonation properties and mechanical sensitivities were respectively investigated. Subsequently, EC-Pb was combined with four different proportions (1 wt%-4wt%) of carbon aerogel (CA) to prepare energetic composites with core-shell structure, EC-Pb@CA. Its composition, structure and morphology were characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD, Raman, XPS, FT-IR, BET, TG et al. Moreover, the promoting effects of EC-Pb and EC-Pb@CA on thermolysis of ammonium perchlorate (AP) were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and non-isothermal decomposition kinetics. The study results indicated that EC-Pb@1 %CA has the most significant promoting effect on AP thermolysis, which could reduce the thermolysis peak temperature of AP from 418.2 to 302.3 °C and drastically decrease the activation energy (E a) from 197.3 to 93.5 kJ mol−1, which was better than most reported Pb-based material. Compared with EC-Pb acting alone on AP, EC-Pb@1 %CA exhibits stronger conductivity and energy transfer ability between core and shell layers. Additionally, the empty electron orbitals of Pb ions facilitate electron transfer between ClO4 - and NH4 +, thereby enhancing the promoting effect on AP thermolysis. The research findings not only enrich the application field of energetic complexes but also provide a reference for the design of high-performance AP combustion promoters in the further.
