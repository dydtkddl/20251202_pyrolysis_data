Exploring the synergistic promoting effect of core-shell energetic composite EC-Pb@CA on ammonium perchlorate thermolysis In this paper, using 1,3-bis(5-tetrazolyl)triazene (H3BTT, N% = 85) as energetic ligand, a new lead-based energetic complex {[Pb2(HBTT)2(H2O)7]·H2O}n (EC-Pb) was synthesized under hydrothermal condition. Its crystal structure, thermal decomposition behavior, theoretical detonation properties and mechanical sensitivities were respectively investigated. Subsequently, EC-Pb was combined with four different proportions (1 wt%-4wt%) of carbon aerogel (CA) to prepare energetic composites with core-shell structure, EC-Pb@CA. Its composition, structure and morphology were characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD, Raman, XPS, FT-IR, BET, TG et al. Moreover, the promoting effects of EC-Pb and EC-Pb@CA on thermolysis of ammonium perchlorate (AP) were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and non-isothermal decomposition kinetics. The study results indicated that EC-Pb@1 %CA has the most significant promoting effect on AP thermolysis, which could reduce the thermolysis peak temperature of AP from 418.2 to 302.3 °C and drastically decrease the activation energy (E a) from 197.3 to 93.5 kJ mol−1, which was better than most reported Pb-based material. Compared with EC-Pb acting alone on AP, EC-Pb@1 %CA exhibits stronger conductivity and energy transfer ability between core and shell layers. Additionally, the empty electron orbitals of Pb ions facilitate electron transfer between ClO4 - and NH4 +, thereby enhancing the promoting effect on AP thermolysis. The research findings not only enrich the application field of energetic complexes but also provide a reference for the design of high-performance AP combustion promoters in the further.
