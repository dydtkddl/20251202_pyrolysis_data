You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic degradation of expandable polystyrene waste (EPSW) over mordenite and modified mordenites The performance of the several different modified mordenite zeolites in the degradation of expandable polystyrene waste (EPSW) was investigated in this study. The composition of the degradation products, especially the liquid fraction was compared to understand the role of H-mordenite and the effect of its modification through framework dealumination and metal impregnation. The degradation was carried out in a batch reactor at 360 and 400°C. The dealuminated mordenite with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 86 showed enhanced styrene/styrene dimer and styrene/ethylbenzene molar ratios at lower (360°C) and higher (400°C) temperature, respectively. This was attributed to the intermediate acid strength distribution generated on removal of framework aluminum by acid leaching. Modification of H-mordenite by metal impregnation substantially changed the acidic and catalytic properties in polystyrene degradation. The 0.64wt.% phosphorous loading on H-mordenite showed improved EPSW conversion, styrene yield and SM/EB molar ratio at 400°C. The 0.32wt.% phosphorous loading facilitated the improvement in SM/EB molar ratio with higher styrene selectivity than thermal degradation at 360°C.
