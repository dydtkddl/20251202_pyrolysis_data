You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Time and temperature depended fuel gas generation from pyrolysis of real world municipal plastic waste On a large scale, amount of pyrolytic gas generated and their components has a very important role in product recovery in form of energy. The obtained gases having HHV can be utilized for generation of power or can be utilized in the process itself to reduce the input energy and helps to become self sustainable process. In the present study, real world municipal plastic waste mainly comprising of polyethylene (low and high density), polypropylene, polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate were pyrolyzed at different temperatures, ranging 450–600°C with a sample mass of 200g to create an appropriate real blend environment. The non-condensable gaseous product generation profile was studied along with heat transfer profile in reactor. The effect and formation of gaseous products was explained based on experimental investigation which shows an increase in H2 on increasing the temperature with decrease in low molecular weight hydrocarbons. In addition, the identification of non-condensable gaseous components was done using gas chromatography. Effect of residence time was strong at higher temperature process conditions producing heavier hydrocarbons in gas; and in oil as wax. Increase in operating temperature increased the concentration of H2 whereas no effect on formation of CO and CO2 was observed. Recovery time of non-condensable gases was less at higher temperature whereas yield increases on increasing the operating temperature. Residence time of volatiles in reactor affected the formation of hydrocarbons like ethylene, propane and n-butane.
