You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Revisiting Unsaturated Polyesters: Recyclable-by-Design Vinylester Resins for the Circular Economy Unsaturated polyesters (UPs) are a family of thermoset polymers largely used for glass fiber reinforced composite (GFRC) manufacturing, but their recycling is very challenging due to their crosslinked structure. Here, novel recyclable-by-design model unsaturated polymer resins were redesigned, positioning the C=C acrylic unsaturations as end groups and replacing styrene with alternative reactive diluents bearing –OH groups. The crosslinked polymers showed thermomechanical properties in line with conventional UPs, and the corresponding GFRCs containing 30 %vol of GFs were successfully prepared. Both the crosslinked unsaturated polymers and their composites were effectively solvolyzed in mild conditions (T = 200 °C, atmospheric pressure, t = 1–3 h) using different alcohols and glycols as solvent media, and 1,5,7-trazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene as transesterification catalyst. Liberated GFs were found to be clean (as assessed by thermogravimetric analysis) and retained nearly 100 % of their original modulus and strength. The recovered organic recyclate showed a high –OH functional group reactivity and could be reused as hydroxylated binder in the formulation of bicomponent polyurethane coatings. These materials were found to exhibit excellent optical clarity, high Tg (> 100 °C), good substrate adhesion (3.45 MPa on glass), and moderate hydrophilicity (water contact angle of 65°). Finally, the same unsaturated polymer resins were prepared with the addition of the transesterification catalyst directly in the liquid prepolymer formulation. While the base physical properties of the crosslinked material remained unchanged, the resulting network showed a dynamic behavior, with thermally-induced stress-relaxation response clearly dependent on both hydroxyl group content and catalyst concentration, and easy post-cure thermoformability.
