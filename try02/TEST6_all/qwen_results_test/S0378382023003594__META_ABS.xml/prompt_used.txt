You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon black production characteristics and mechanisms from pyrolysis of rubbers Pyrolysis is a promising way to treat the waste tires for high value carbon black production. However, the carbon black formation mechanism is still unclear due to the complex decomposition and polymerization reactions during the pyrolysis of tire components. In this study, the production behavior, characters, and mechanism of carbon black from pyrolysis of natural rubber (NR), butadiene rubber (BR), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) were investigated. The yield of carbon black was increased from 20.8%–24.4% to 47.9%–56.7% with the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 1100 to 1300°C. Although the carbon black production yield from NR was lower than that of BR and SBR at 1300°C, the graphitization degree (I D/I G = 2.22), microcrystal length (3.17 nm) and mean particle diameter (90.3 nm) of the carbon black derived from NR were the highest. The volatile evolution, carbon black nucleation mechanisms were revealed by reactive force-field molecular dynamics simulations. The pyrolysis of BR and SBR generated more C2H2, C2H3⋅, long carbon-chains and cyclic molecules than NR, which probably resulted in a higher carbon black yield than NR. With few defect borders, regular stacking and wrapping of the aromatic layers, the carbon black from NR exhibited more ordered nucleation and high graphitization degree.
