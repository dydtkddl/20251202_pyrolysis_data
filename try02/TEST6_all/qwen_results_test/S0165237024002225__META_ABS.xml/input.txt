Unlocking the potential of waste cooking oil pyrolysis for chemicals purposes: Review, challenges, and prospects Waste cooking oil (WCO) is increasingly recognized as a valuable resource rather than a waste product, given its potential for recycling and reprocessing into various chemicals. The utilization of WCO has grown significantly, driven by environmental concerns, the push for renewable energy sources, and technological advancements in recycling processes. Applications of WCO include biodiesel production, bioenergy and heat, animal feed, chemical feedstocks, and their derivatives. This review specifically intends to study the potential of WCO pyrolysis for chemical feedstocks such as light hydrocarbons (C1 – C4), syngas (CO and H2), and liquid products under catalytic and co-feeding processes. Catalytic pyrolysis of WCO offers improved gas yield of up to 76 % and liquid product yield of up to 94 %. The catalysts used also vary from clay, activated carbon, metals, chemical solid wastes, and zeolites. Of all, zeolites provide the most satisfactory performance in terms of yield, thermal stability, shape selectivity, and recyclability. Likewise, the co-feeding method is offered to enhance process efficiency, product quality, and waste valorization which further promotes sustainability. The catalyst-assisted process has a maximum gas yield of 73 % and a maximum liquid yield of 84 %. Looking at the findings, kinetic studies, various types of zeolite-based catalysts, and material selection for co-feeding are important to develop to overcome challenges in WCO pyrolysis studies as well as fill future prospects. Furthermore, a sustainable and closed-loop approach in WCO pyrolysis is proposed as a potential outlook.
