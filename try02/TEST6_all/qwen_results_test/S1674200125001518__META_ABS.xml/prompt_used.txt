You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam cracking of polypropylene for the production of light olefins in a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor This paper presents an alternative approach for plastic waste valorization in a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor. The study evaluates the application of an upgraded spouted bed design for the steam cracking of polypropylene (PP) at 750 °C, focusing on high value added products. The highly efficient cracking process results in a high gas yield of 80.9 wt%. This stream is composed of H2, CO, CO2, C1-C4 paraffins and C2-C4 olefins, with the latter reaching a total yield of 49.2 wt%. Among the light olefins, propylene (21.8 wt%) and ethylene (16.5 wt%) are the most relevant. Interestingly, a remarkable yield of the valuable BTX fraction was obtained, 14.0 wt%, with benzene being the predominant compound. The reactor configuration and excellent control of process conditions enhanced light olefins yield by β-scission and radical mechanism, promoting the formation of light hydrocarbons, as well as minimizing secondary oligomerization and reforming reactions. This study is a proof of the viability of steam cracking in a fountain confined spouted bed reactor for converting PP into valuable chemical intermediates, as well as the viability of this technology for industrial application in waste plastic valorization.
