You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Identification and characterization of plastics from small appliances and kinetic analysis of their thermally activated pyrolysis The first step consisted in a field investigation carried out in Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) treatment plants coupled with a bibliographic product analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy polymers identification. Three main polymers of the thermoplastic fraction of small appliances were identified: in the external cases it was possible to find acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS), while polybutadiene terephthalate (PBT) was contained in the printed circuit boards (PCBs). Taking into account this identification, a ternary polymer mixture of ABS-HIPS-PBT was prepared as a representative sample of the thermoplastic fraction contained in WEEE (real WEEE sample). From the thermal characterization (proximate and ultimate analysis, high heating value (HHV) direct measurement and Energy-Dispersive-X-Ray-Fluorescence analysis (ED-XRF)) the only polymer whose properties sensibly differ from the analogous virgin polymer is the one contained in PCBs. A kinetic analysis of pyrolysis occurring on the three components and on their ternary mixture was performed using a thermogravimetry (TG) apparatus in argon atmosphere under non isothermal conditions. Triplicates of TG experiments at four heating rates of 2, 5, 10 and 15 K min−1 were carried out and two different model-free approaches were adopted, namely the Kissinger and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall methods in order to determine the activation energy E (as a single mean value or as a function of the degree of conversion α). The conversion dependencies of both activation energy and pre-exponential factors were determined as well as the reaction model, representing the reaction mechanism. The suitability of the models selected was tested using the Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) score, being the geometric model R3 the best found for pyrolysis of ABS, HIPS and real WEEE samples, while PBT sample showed an uncertainty between the R3 and the diffusion D2 model. The reaction time values to achieve the maximum pyrolysis rate in the three main components and in the real WEEE sample were also calculated.
