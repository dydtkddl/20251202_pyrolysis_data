Electrostatic spinning technology coupled with traditional pollution control processes: A review Electrospun nanofibers exhibit large specific surface areas and multiporous and multisite structures, which enable their use as reaction media for confined-space utilization and as carriers for immobilizing active particles. This paper systematically reviews the integration mechanisms of electrospinning technology with traditional pollutant treatment techniques, such as adsorption, catalysis, electro-remediation, bioremediation, and oil-water separation, and then summarizes the advantages and challenges of multi-technology coupling strategies, aiming to provide support for establishing a multi-technology coupling system and achieving synergistic treatment of pollutants.
