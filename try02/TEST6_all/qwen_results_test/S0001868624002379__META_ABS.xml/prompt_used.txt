You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on synthesis, capping and applications of superparamagnetic magnetic nanoparticles Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their numerous technologically significant applications in diverse fields, including biomedicine, diagnostics, agriculture, optics, mechanics, electronics, sensing technology, catalysis, and environmental remediation. The superparamagnetic nature of MNP is exploited for many applications and remains fascinating to study many fundamental phenomena. The uniqueness of this review is that it gives an in-depth review of different synthesis approaches adopted for preparing magnetic nanoparticles and nanoparticle formation mechanisms, functionalizing them with different capping agents, and applying different functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. The important synthesis techniques covered include coprecipitation, microwave-assisted, sonochemical, sol-gel, microemulsion, hydrothermal/solvothermal, thermal decomposition, and mechano-chemical synthesis. Further, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed, and tables show important results of prepared particles. Other aspects covered in this review are the dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in the continuous matrix, the influence of surface capping on high-temperature thermal stability, the long-term stability of ferrofluids, and applications of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. For effective utilization of the ferrite nanoparticles, it is essential to formulate thermally and colloidally stable magnetic nanoparticles with desired magnetic properties. Capping enhances the phase transition temperature and long-term colloidal stability. Magnetic nanoparticles capped or functionalized with specific binding species, specific components like drugs, or other functional groups make them suitable for applications in biotechnology/biomedicine. Recent studies reveal the tremendous scope of MNPs in therapeutics and theranostics. The requirements for nanoparticle size, morphology, and physio-chemical properties, especially magnetic properties, functionalization, and stability, vary with applications. There are also challenges for precise size control and the cost-effective production of nanoparticles in large quantities. The review should be an ideal material for researchers working on magnetic nanomaterials and an excellent reference for freshers.
