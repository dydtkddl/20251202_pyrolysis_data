You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sewage sludge thermochemical treatment with MgCl2: Preparation conditions impact on trace metal elements vaporization and phosphorus recovery Phosphorus (P) plays an essential role in crops growth. Due to the overexploitation of non-renewable phosphate rock deposits and their uneven distribution worldwide, P has turned into a strategic resource for the modern agricultural system. Finding sustainable ways to secure P for fertilizer applications has become critical. Sewage sludge (SS) is a waste material containing P in high amounts. Among several options, SS thermochemical treatment with Cl-donors addition such as MgCl2, CaCl2 or NaCl allows to separate P from inorganics pollutants such as trace metal elements (TME). The additives goal is to help fix and form bioavailable P species in solid residues while promoting TME vaporization through the gas phase via chlorination mechanisms. This paper studies the impact of MgCl2 addition on TME vaporization and P speciation during SS direct calcination treatment at 1000 °C for 4 h. Four different preparation methods for the “SS + MgCl2” mixtures were compared, with a variation of either the SS (raw or crushed) or the MgCl2 form (powder or solution). The samples were characterized by ED-XRF, FTIR, XRD, TGA/DSC and the P speciation was obtained thanks to Williams-Saunders method. The use of 0.06 g MgCl2/g SS as a Cl-donor divides the TME contents in the solid residues by a factor of more than 10 for Zn and Pb, about 2 for As and Ni but less than 1.25 for Cu. Concerning P, Ca associated P species (mostly Mg3Ca3(PO4)4) are formed with MgCl2 addition. The results showed that the impact of different preparation methods on the obtained solid residues characteristics is limited.
