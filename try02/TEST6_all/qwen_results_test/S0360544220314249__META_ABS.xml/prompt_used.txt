You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Operating conditions to maximize clean liquid fuels yield by oligomerization of 1-butene on HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts The effect of operating conditions has been extensively studied for the selective oligomerization of 1-butene to clean synthetic liquid fuels. HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio = 30–280) based catalysts provided with a hierarchical porous structure have been tested in a fixed bed reactor under the following conditions: 175–325 °C; 1.5–40 bar; space time, 0.5–6 gcatalyst·h molC −1. Special attention has been paid to individual and lumped gaseous and liquid product distribution (which have been characterized by gas chromatography, GC × GC/MS and simulated distillation), as well as to catalyst stability, by performing long duration experiments (20 h). An optimum region to maximize both naphtha (C5-11, >40%), and diesel (C12-20, >20%) yields has been established at 250–275 °C and 30 bar for space time values of 2–4 gcatalyst h molC −1. Furthermore, the catalysts have tended to a pseudo-stationary deactivation state after 5 h on stream, where the coke deposited on the spent catalysts is mainly composed of adsorbed bulky oligomers (determined by TPD-N2), with low coke contents ∼1.0–1.5 wt% (determined by TPO).
