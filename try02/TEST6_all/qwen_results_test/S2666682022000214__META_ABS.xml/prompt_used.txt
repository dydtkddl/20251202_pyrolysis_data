You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flame retardant potential of Tetra Pak®-derived biochar for ethylene-vinyl-acetate copolymers Food packaging waste-stream is a serious threat for current lifestyle sustainability. Among all the materials, Tetra Pak® is one of the most employed to produce food and beverage containers. Its composition represents a challenge for waste management due the simultaneous presence of poly(ethylene), paper and aluminum, wrapped together into a multilayered packaging. In this work, we report on the pyrolytic conversion of Tetra Pak® to produce alumina-rich biochar (BC), to be used as a flame retardant for an ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA) copolymer. In particular, the obtained biochar was incorporated either into bulk EVA through compounding or just as a surface coating. For the surface approach, a masterbatch of biochar and EVA was prepared and then applied to the surface of unfilled EVA specimens. Both the strategies turned out to significantly improve the overall flame retardant features of the copolymer: as compared to unfilled EVA, the bulk approach promoted a remarkable decrease of peak of heat release rate (-45 and -65%, for the compounds containing 20 and 40 wt.% of BC, respectively) and of total heat release (-16.9% for the compounds filled with 40 wt.% of BC), combined with a significant increase of the residues at the end of forced combustion tests; conversely, the surface approach was capable of delaying the time to ignition and the time to peak of heat release rate, depending of the BC amount: more specifically, for the surface-coated EVA with the lowest BC loading (i.e. 3 wt.%), the two parameters increased by about 34 and 21%, respectively. The thermal, rheological and mechanical properties were also investigated, as well as the morphology of the BC particles and their dispersion in the copolymer matrix. In particular, increasing the biochar loading promoted an increase of the stiffness of the resulting compounds, as well as a decrease of their ductility with respect to unfilled EVA.
