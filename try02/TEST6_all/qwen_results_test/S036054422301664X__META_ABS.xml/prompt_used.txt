You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of plastic type on synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis of rice husk and plastics Pyrolysis of varied type of plastic waste generates distinct reaction intermediates, which affect their co-pyrolysis with biomass feedstock in different ways. This was investigated herein in co-pyrolysis of specific plastic types, including polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polycarbonate (PC), as well as rice husk (RH) at 600–800 °C. The experimental results demonstrated that synergistic mechanisms in the co-pyrolysis were dependent on plastic type. PP provided small hydrogen radicals to pyrolyzates derived from RH, leading to an increase in aromatic production up to 69.5% at 600 °C. PS melted and acted as an insulator, inhibiting oil formation while increasing char yield. Organic acids derived from PET enhanced the char formation and dehydration of RH, resulting in increased levels of char and water. The interaction between RH/PET resulted in a reduction of aromatics by 53.2% at 800 °C because of the synergistic promotion of water formation. In contrast, aromatic structures in PC interfered with degradation of oxygen-containing functional groups in RH, enhancing oil, with aromatics increasing by 35.7% at 700 °C, as well as increased gas yields through promoting decomposition of RH. Furthermore, when all the feedstocks were mixed together, accelerated pyrolytic interactions enhanced the cracking of each individual polymer.
