You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reverse polymerization of waste polystyrene through microwave assisted pyrolysis Reverse polymerization of waste polystyrene (PS) was exploited to produce styrene and other aromatics through microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP), due to the benefits associated with microwave (MW) heating. MAP of PS was run by varying MW power and absorber (tire and carbonaceous char from MAP of tire). A clear and low viscosity liquid containing styrene was always collected as the major product, together with low amount of char and gas. Using a MW power of 3kW and 100g of PS together with 47.3g of carbon gave a liquid (yield 86.5%) containing higher amount of single ring aromatic compounds, as evaluated by GC–MS (aromatics C6–C10 93.9%, styrene 66.0%) a char (yield 9.8%) and a gas (yield 3.7%). Improvements in residence time, by using low MW power or a fractionating system directly inserted over the oven and before the collecting system, allowed us to obtain a liquid with low viscosity and density even if the char yield was 10.0%. Liquid was characterized through physical (density, viscosity, high heating value), and chemical tests (elemental analysis, GC–MS and FT-IR).
