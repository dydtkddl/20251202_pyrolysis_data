You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalysis co-calcination: An available and energy-saving approach to prepare metal/carbon materials with well hydrophobicity and photo-thermal conversion performance Benefitting from its lightweight, low cost and considerable liquid holding capability, bio-based 3D carbon materials with considerable hydrophobicity have stood out as effective oil-water separators to address oily water problems. However, in order to obtain ideal hydrophobicity, recent approaches such as the thermal-induced sp2-hybridization and nano-texturing construction are energy-consuming and complicated, limiting the large-scale production. Here, through the catalysis co-calcination of transition metals salts (TMSs) and biomass precursor, agriculture solid waste-sugarcane residues were successfully converted to hydrophobic photo-thermal metal/carbon materials (CMs) with lower calcination temperature. Comparing with normal carbonization method, catalysis co-calcination can achieve higher carbonization degree and larger yield with lower consumption energy. The as-prepared Cu-CMs can adsorb 18.49 g/g, 31.33 g/g, 24.45 g/g, 38.25 g/g, and 41.98 g/g of DMF, toluene, methanol, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, showing excellent adsorption capability towards organic solvents. Moreover, owing to the synergistic photothermal effect of carbon skeleton and metal remains, the metal/carbon materials can heat the oil efficiently and show better adsorption performance for high-viscous oil. The catalysis co-calcination method is demonstrated as a promising method to produce CMs with unique properties and the metal/carbon materials is also supposed to be an effective wastewater treat materials.
