You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of plastic chemical recycling processes in a circular economy context It is estimated that nearly 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year worldwide. However, only 10% of this enormous amount is recycled after use. Currently, mechanical recycling is the dominant method, despite certain operational limitations. To increase recycling rates, chemical recycling processes are emerging as viable alternatives, promising the creation of more valuable products. This comprehensive review begins with an introduction to ongoing plastic recycling technologies, covering general pretreatment methods for plastic waste and the taxonomy of various recycling technologies and their applications for specific polymer recycling. Then various aspects of chemical recycling are examined to explore its role within the context of a circular economy. Detailing chemical recycling technologies, such as depolymerization pathways and thermochemical pathways, are systematically elaborated. It also delves into optimization strategies, technological maturity, and economic assessments of chemical recycling. In addition, this review also examines the symbiotic and/or substitutional relationship between conventional recycling methods and alternatives, including biological recycling, biodegradable polymers, and eco-design. Finally, the approaches to improve the large-scale application of chemical recycling technology from the perspectives of technological level, infrastructure construction, public awareness enhancement, and national and international policy formulation are discussed. This review aims to provide theoretical support and practical recommendations for the future development of chemical recycling technologies to achieve the goals of sustainable development and a circular economy.
