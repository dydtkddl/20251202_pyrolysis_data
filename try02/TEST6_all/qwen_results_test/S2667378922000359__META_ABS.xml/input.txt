Insights into the options of energy and metal recovery from automotive shredder residue: A review Following treatment in a shredding facility and metals removal, Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) is generated as a waste. This paper reviewed the state-of-the-art of research and development of thermochemical conversion and metal recovery from ASR. The characteristics of ASR are discussed in terms of compositions, and then the emphasis is given to different thermochemical conversion methods - incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification. In addition, the characterization of products obtained from these processes is then critically reviewed. The latter part deals with metal recovery focussed on conventional metallurgical processes - pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy of ASR. The limitations of the conventional metal recovery process are discussed, followed by recommendations for technology development on energy and metal recovery options from ASR, in particular solvometallurgy, an emerging trend for efficient metal recovery. A clear conclusion is that ASR is a valuable feedstock for energy production and metal recovery as it comprises mainly plastics and metals.
