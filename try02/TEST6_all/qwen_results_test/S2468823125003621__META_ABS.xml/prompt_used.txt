You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic catalyst Ru/NbOPO4/TiO2 for selective hydrodeoxygenation of phenolics towards unlocking lignin's potential Lignin valorization has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its abundance and potential as a renewable organic carbon resource to produce a variety of value-added chemicals and fuel additives. Catalytic upgrading of lignin faces challenges due to its complex structure and an active catalyst with selective surface properties is needed to break the stable C–O and C–C interunit linkages. In the present work, we developed a series of multifunctional Ru/NbOPO4/TiO2 catalysts with varying surface acidic properties and explored their potential upon hydrogenolysis of lignin model compound eugenol. Textural and surface acidic properties of the prepared materials were studied by means of different techniques such as N2-physisorption, NH3-TPD, XRD, SEM-EDS, Raman spectra, FT-IR, and TEM. Our catalytic results revealed synergistic role of acid and metal sites upon catalyst performance, whereupon high yields of hydrocarbons (86.9–100 wt.%) were obtained with selective cleavage of the methoxy and hydroxy groups under milder conditions. A kinetic study further identified the reaction mechanism and determined a rate law and partial reaction orders. This research advances the understanding of catalyst design for upgrading of the lignin or lignin monomers into value added chemicals. and on the other hand, contributes to sustainable development by maximizing biomass usage and providing environmentally friendly alternatives in renewable energy.
