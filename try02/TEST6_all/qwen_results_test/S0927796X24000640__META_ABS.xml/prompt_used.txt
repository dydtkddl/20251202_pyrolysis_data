You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in high-entropy alloys for laser powder bed fusion: Design, processing, microstructure, and performance Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), as the most commercialized metal additive manufacturing technique, is tantalizing the metallurgical community owing to its capabilities of directly producing highly intricate parts with complex geometries and achieving superior properties compared to those of conventionally manufactured alloys. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a class of novel materials consisting of multiple principal elements in near-equiatomic ratios, revolutionizing the alloy design concept. LPBF has been employed to fabricate HEAs in numerous attempts to improve their outstanding mechanical, physical, and chemical properties. This review systematically compares seven unique classes of LPBF-produced HEAs—the 3d transition metal HEAs, eutectic HEAs, precipitation-strengthened HEAs, refractory HEAs, metastable HEAs, interstitial HEAs, and high-entropy matrix composites—pertaining to their feedstock preparation, printability, microstructure, strengthening mechanisms, material properties, and potential applications. Additionally, the computational modeling of HEAs for LPBF is extensively discussed. This work aims to guide relevant research in the field by systematically reviewing the advancements in the design strategies employed for the successful fabrication of HEAs by LPBF.
