You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effects of char and potassium on the fast pyrolysis behaviors of biomass in an infrared-heating condition During the solar pyrolysis of biomass, the heat transfer of biomass is restrained due to uncontrolled heating area and accumulation effect. So the co-pyrolysis reaction behaviors of biomass and char, and the secondary pyrolysis reactions of biomass under co-pyrolysis situation are worth exploring. The effects of char and potassium on fast pyrolysis products distribution by fully mixing and extruding sample materials under various heating rates (5 °C/s, 20 °C/s, 100 °C/s) and pyrolysis temperature (350 °C, 425 °C, 500 °C) were discussed. The results showed that high temperature was favorable to the release of volatiles, and higher heating rate promoted decomposition of bio-oils into gaseous products. Higher heating rate contributed to the release of O element and the accumulation of C element in bio-char to some extent. The char enhanced the secondary pyrolysis reaction resulting further decomposition of small molecular acids and the conversion of guaiacyl-contained structure into simple phenols and CH4 by demethylation and demethoxylation reaction. The influences of potassium were concentrated in increasing the reactivity of biomass pyrolysis, which promoted the conversion of bio-oils into gas (especially CO2) and the demethylation reaction of guaiacyl at low temperature.
