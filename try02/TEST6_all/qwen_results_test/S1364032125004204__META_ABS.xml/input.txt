Selecting proper technologies for capturing CO2 from bioenergy conversion Bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) is an essential component for achieving net–zero CO2 emissions. Existing capture technologies developed for fossil energy–based processes (fossil CCS) can be adapted for BECCS. However, the different properties of biofuels compared to fossil fuels can impact the performance of these technologies. This paper aims to characterize the steps and features of CO2 capture from bioenergy conversion processes to identify the most promising opportunities for BECCS implementation. The paper begins by characterizing the performance of capture technologies used in fossil CCS from both technical and economic perspectives and then summarizes the compositions of the gas streams from various bioenergy conversion processes, including anaerobic digestion, torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, gasification, and combustion, where CO2 is captured. By exploring the impurity impacts on CO2 capture, from both technical and economic perspectives, and the potential impurities from different processes, recommendations on the selection of CO2 capture technologies are provided for the considered bioenergy conversion processes. It is worth to note that high uncertainties still exist in both energy penalties and capture costs, which highlight the need for demonstration projects.
