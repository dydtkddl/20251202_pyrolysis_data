The direct catalytic conversion of teff straw into fuel intermediate: Optimization of reaction parameters The growing global demand for renewable energy has driven significant advancements in the field of catalytic processes that facilitate the conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals. This study presents the direct production of furfural from untreated teff straw using an inexpensive Fe-based catalyst in a biphasic solvent system (water/tetrahydrofuran). Prior to the experiments, a compositional analysis was conducted to determine the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content, along with a proximate analysis. In addition, a method for quantification of xylose for yield calculation is proposed. Response surface methodology (RSM) was implemented using a central composite design (CCD) to examine the correlation between furfural production and reaction parameters, including temperature, time and catalyst loading. This approach resulted in an empirical process model, subsequently enabling the optimization of the reaction parameters. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.97) obtained from the variance analysis indicated a good fit of the quadratic model for a square root transformation. The numerical optimization demonstrated that the maximum furfural yield within the given range can be achieved at approximately 190 °C, 114 min, and 0.36 g of catalyst. The confirmation step predicted the lower (0.042 g) and upper bounds (0.077 g) for furfural production from 0.5 g of teff straw with a 95 % confidence interval. After conducting a triplicate run based on the suggested optimized reaction parameters, model validation was confirmed, yielding 0.049 g of furfural per 0.5 g of teff straw, equivalent to ∼60 % yield based on experimentally determined xylose content, which falls within the predicted interval. The residual from the reaction sample was utilized for CO2 hydrogenation, resulting in the formation of methane and ethane.
