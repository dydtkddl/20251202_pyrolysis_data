You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The direct catalytic conversion of teff straw into fuel intermediate: Optimization of reaction parameters The growing global demand for renewable energy has driven significant advancements in the field of catalytic processes that facilitate the conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals. This study presents the direct production of furfural from untreated teff straw using an inexpensive Fe-based catalyst in a biphasic solvent system (water/tetrahydrofuran). Prior to the experiments, a compositional analysis was conducted to determine the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content, along with a proximate analysis. In addition, a method for quantification of xylose for yield calculation is proposed. Response surface methodology (RSM) was implemented using a central composite design (CCD) to examine the correlation between furfural production and reaction parameters, including temperature, time and catalyst loading. This approach resulted in an empirical process model, subsequently enabling the optimization of the reaction parameters. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.97) obtained from the variance analysis indicated a good fit of the quadratic model for a square root transformation. The numerical optimization demonstrated that the maximum furfural yield within the given range can be achieved at approximately 190 °C, 114 min, and 0.36 g of catalyst. The confirmation step predicted the lower (0.042 g) and upper bounds (0.077 g) for furfural production from 0.5 g of teff straw with a 95 % confidence interval. After conducting a triplicate run based on the suggested optimized reaction parameters, model validation was confirmed, yielding 0.049 g of furfural per 0.5 g of teff straw, equivalent to ∼60 % yield based on experimentally determined xylose content, which falls within the predicted interval. The residual from the reaction sample was utilized for CO2 hydrogenation, resulting in the formation of methane and ethane.
