You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microstructure and mechanical property of high-density 7075 Al alloy by compression molding of POM-based feedstock Metal injection molding of aluminium alloy (MIM-Al) attracts attention, owing to the lightweight, corrosion resistance and good thermal conductivity. However, it is hard to fabricate high-quality MIM-Al due to the hard-to-sinter powder and poor mechanical properties. Here, we report a facile compression molding process for fabricating high-density 7075Al alloy parts using polyformaldehyde (POM)-based feedstock. Pressureless sintering with a high nitrogen flow rate was adopted to promote sintering densification process. The wetting behavior, rheological properties, and morphology of the feedstock were characterized, showcasing the shear-thinning behavior and suitable viscosity for POM-PP-SA binder. Through controlling the compact pressure, mold temperature and holding time, green gear part with good shape retention and dense microstructure was achieved. Influence of process factors and sintering temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 7075Al alloy are investigated. Remarkably, the aluminum alloy components sintered at 610 °C exhibited excellent performance, with a relative density reaching 97.6 % and a tensile strength of 214.8 MPa. This achievement provides a foundation for the industrial application of complex-shaped aluminum alloy components through the compression molding process.
