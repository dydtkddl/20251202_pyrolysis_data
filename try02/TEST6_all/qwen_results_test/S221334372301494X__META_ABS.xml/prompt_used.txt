You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mineralization of polystyrene nanoplastics in water by photo-Fenton oxidation Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as hotspots for the spread of micro(nano)plastics (MPs/NPs) in water. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as promising alternatives for tackling MPs/NPs pollution, however, the number of studies on this topic remains quite limited and needs further research. In this study, the feasibility of the photo-Fenton process (UV/ H2O2/ Fe3+) carried out at ambient conditions and using a broad-spectrum UV-Vis lamp was investigated for the degradation of polystyrene (PS) NPs in water. The impact of the main variables of the process, namely initial PS concentration, Fe3+ concentration, initial pH, H2O2 dose and particle size, was evaluated. Under optimized operating conditions ([PS NPs]0 = 20 mg L−1; [Fe3+]0 = 1 mg L−1; [H2O2]0 = 130 mg L−1; pH0 = 3 and T = 25 ºC), complete mineralization of PS NPs (140 nm) was achieved in 40 min. The outstanding performance of the process was mainly due to the wavelength and light intensity of the UV-lamp employed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the field of photoassisted AOPs reporting the complete and fast mineralization of PS NPs in water, under ambient conditions. According to our results, photo-Fenton process can be applied to higher loads and larger particle sizes by adjusting the supplied oxidant dose and extending the reaction time. Hence, the photo-Fenton process displays great potential for producing high-quality reclaimed water and/or to be combined with a conventional separation process to treat concentrate streams and mineralize NPs at WWTPs.
