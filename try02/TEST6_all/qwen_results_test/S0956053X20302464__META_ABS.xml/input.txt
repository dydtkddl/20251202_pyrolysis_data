Characterization of post-consumer plastic film waste from mixed MSW in Spain: A key point for the successful implementation of sustainable plastic waste management strategies The purpose of this paper is to provide a full characterization of post-consumer plastic film recovered from mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants in Spain. Currently, this type of plastic waste is not recycled due to technical or economic barriers and is still sent to landfill. Different types of municipal plastic waste (MPW) from manual and automated sorting were studied: i) colour plastic film recovered by ballistic separators and then manual sorting in different seasons; ii) colour plastic film recovered by automated sorting (air suction); and iii) white plastic film from primary manual sorting process. The samples were characterized by different techniques, including the ultimate and proximate analysis, Higher Heating Value (HHV) and Lower Heating Value (LHV), metal content, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Derivative Thermogravimetry (DTG), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The results were compared to those obtained for pretreated colour and white plastic film waste and contrasted with industrial recycled film granules of polyethylene (as a reference material for packaging film). Additionally, pretreated plastic film samples were also characterized by analyzing viscosity, Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) diagram, specific heat capacity and halogen and sulphur contents. Characterization data from this study will contribute to identify and develop potential recycling alternatives for a more sustainable municipal plastic waste management, which is recognized as a priority in the European Circular Economy Action Plan to use resources in a more sustainable way.
