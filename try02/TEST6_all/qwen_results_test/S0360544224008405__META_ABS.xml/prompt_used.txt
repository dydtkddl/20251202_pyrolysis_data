You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic insights into Ga-modified hollow ZSM-5 catalyzed fast pyrolysis of cassava residue The preparation of valuable chemicals by catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is a promising and environmentally-friendly approach for the selective upgrading of waste cassava residue (CR). This work systematically investigated the conversion mechanism and kinetic characteristics of CR pyrolysis over Ga-modified hollow ZSM-5, for the purpose of enhancing aromatics production. The hollow configuration significantly regulated the structural characteristics of ZSM-5, thus facilitating the diffusion, deoxygenation, and aromatization of pyrolysis intermediates. The incorporation of Ga species and generated Brønsted acid sites remarkably accelerated the reaction rate and suppressed the carbonization at high temperatures, through enhancing the end scission of starch and cellulose components. With the aid of 5Ga/ZSM-H, the relative content of aromatics achieved 95.4% at 700 °C, and still maintained over 92.5% even after 5 cycles. The ring-opening and retro-aldol degradation were identified as crucial steps for the production of ketones and aldehydes separately, which were further transformed into hydrocarbon pools by deoxygenation and subsequently converted into aromatics via Diels-Alder reaction. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the use of 5Ga/ZSM-H lowered the average activation energy of CR pyrolysis by 14.8%, particularly for the initial pyrolysis stage. Moreover, the plausible mechanism for aromatics formation from Ga-modified hollow ZSM-5 catalyzed CR pyrolysis was proposed.
