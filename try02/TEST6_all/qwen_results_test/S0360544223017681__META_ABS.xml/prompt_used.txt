You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ca promoted Ni–Co bimetallic catalyzed coal pyrolysis and char steam gasification Coal catalytic pyrolysis has been applied in the clean and efficient utilization of low-rank coal to obtain combustible gases and high value-added chemicals. Herein, Ni–Co–Ca catalysts were added into coal through impregnation for catalytic pyrolysis of Yunnan lignite and the char steam gasification. The H2 production reached 3.24 mmol/g of coal and the gas conversion was 27.84% of the coal pyrolysis under 5Ni–5Co–1Ca. The char conversion reached 98.21% and the H2 production was 90.68 mmol/g of char steam gasification. Ni and Co could promote coal catalytic pyrolysis by cracking the C–H and C–C bonds. The formation of Ni–Co alloy could prevent catalysts inactivation due to the metal oxidation, lattice distortion and carbon deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the electron transfer from Co to Ni has been improved due to the Ca promoting effect, enhancing Ni catalytic activity and promoting coal pyrolysis for more small gaseous molecules. Ca could endow char with abundant pore structure, improving the irregular degree of char crystallite structure, which was attributed to the char gasification at high temperature to obtain H2. This study provided guidance to modulate pyrolysis products distribution by regulating catalysts properties.
