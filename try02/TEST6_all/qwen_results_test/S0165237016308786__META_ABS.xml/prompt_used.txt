You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Group additive modeling of cyclopentane pyrolysis The pyrolysis of cyclopentane is not well established although it is an abundant compound in typical naphtha feedstocks and can be considered a model compound for cyclic fuels. The studies in literature so far have focused primarily on the initial decomposition of cyclopentane in shock tubes. This article therefore explores the pyrolysis of cyclopentane in a continuous flow tubular reactor with pure cyclopentane feed at reactor conditions 0.17MPa, 973–1073K, and a residence time of 0.5s. Conversions of 5% to 75% were realized while the product concentrations were quantified using two dimensional gas chromatography. A mechanism composed of elementary high pressure limit reactions has been generated using the automatic network generation tool “Genesys”. Kinetics of the reactions originate from high level ab-initio calculations and new group additive values derived from ab-initio kinetic data in literature. Overall the Genesys model outperforms the models available in literature and there is a good agreement between model calculated mass fraction profiles and experimental data for 22 products ranging from hydrogen to naphthalene without any adjustments of the kinetic parameters. Reaction path analysis reveals that cyclopentane consumption is initiated by the unimolecular isomerization to 1-pentene, but overall dominated by hydrogen abstraction reactions by allyl radicals and hydrogen atoms to give cyclopentyl radicals, whose ring opening and further scissions lead to smaller molecules. Dominant routes for the major products are discussed.
