Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Spirulina platensis with activated carbon as absorber: Product yield dynamics and fuel properties This study investigates the microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of Spirulina platensis using activated carbon as a microwave absorber, focusing on the effects of microwave power and exposure time on product yields and characteristics. The maximum bio-oil yield (14.42 % ± 0.335 %) was obtained at 600 W for 10 min, and the highest biochar yield (49.39 % ± 1.09 %) at 450 W for 5 min. Statistical analysis confirmed significant main and interaction effects influencing the product yield distribution. The resulting bio-oil and biochar exhibited HHVs of 29.89 MJ/kg and 23.92 MJ/kg, respectively, with corresponding energy recoveries of 19.70 % and 54.01 %, respectively. However, energy consumption ratio indicated that, under the tested conditions, MAP was not energetically favorable when evaluated solely on the basis of biochar and bio-oil. The biochar displayed energy characteristics similar to sub-bituminous coal. FTIR analysis revealed functional groups relevant to fuel chemistry, while fuel property estimates predicted that the bio-oil met EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards for iodine value, cetane number, and kinematic viscosity. GC–MS profiling showed a highly polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the bio-oil. These results highlight the potential of S. platensis-derived bio-oil and biochar as sustainable alternatives to conventional fuels and valuable bioproducts.
