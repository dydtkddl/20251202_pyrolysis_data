You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Spirulina platensis with activated carbon as absorber: Product yield dynamics and fuel properties This study investigates the microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of Spirulina platensis using activated carbon as a microwave absorber, focusing on the effects of microwave power and exposure time on product yields and characteristics. The maximum bio-oil yield (14.42 % ± 0.335 %) was obtained at 600 W for 10 min, and the highest biochar yield (49.39 % ± 1.09 %) at 450 W for 5 min. Statistical analysis confirmed significant main and interaction effects influencing the product yield distribution. The resulting bio-oil and biochar exhibited HHVs of 29.89 MJ/kg and 23.92 MJ/kg, respectively, with corresponding energy recoveries of 19.70 % and 54.01 %, respectively. However, energy consumption ratio indicated that, under the tested conditions, MAP was not energetically favorable when evaluated solely on the basis of biochar and bio-oil. The biochar displayed energy characteristics similar to sub-bituminous coal. FTIR analysis revealed functional groups relevant to fuel chemistry, while fuel property estimates predicted that the bio-oil met EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards for iodine value, cetane number, and kinematic viscosity. GC–MS profiling showed a highly polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the bio-oil. These results highlight the potential of S. platensis-derived bio-oil and biochar as sustainable alternatives to conventional fuels and valuable bioproducts.
