You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The impact of kaolin dehydroxylation on the porosity and mechanical integrity of kaolin based ceramics using different pore formers Thermally induced lattice defects in kaolin play a key role in the mechanical integrity of kaolin based ceramics during heat treatment due to their phase transformations. The effects of three types of pore formers (sawdust, styrofoam and powdery high density polyethylene) on the porosity and mechanical integrity of kaolin based ceramics have been studied based on their batch formulations. The porosity of the ceramic bodies was experimentally determined, while the structure and chemistry of the materials were elucidated via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR, DSC/TG/DTA, and zeta potential. The kaolin-based porous samples sintered at 1150°C exhibited mullite phase transformation attributed to recrystallization effects. Morphologically, open pores were distributed on the sample surfaces due to larger pathways and available channels of eviction of the pore formers. Compressive strength decreased linearly as apparent porosity increased signifying its correlation. The compressive strength showed to be much more sensitive to defects created by dehydroxylation as micro cracks were observed on the sample with HDPE as pore former which could be as a result of large volume change accompanying phase transformations and sensitivity to the dehydroxylation phase. It is noted that the new pore former (HDPE) used in this study produced ceramic bodies with porosity as high as 67% and hence the least compressive strength.
