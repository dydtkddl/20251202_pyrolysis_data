You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar-assisted gasification of raw biomass: a review on the reactivity and synergistic effect on tar reforming The thermal conversion process known as biomass gasification has the potential to produce environmentally friendly fuels such as hydrogen. However, tar generation during the gasification remains an issue, affecting operational efficiency and environmental health. Biochar has been confirmed as an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for tar removal. The challenge lies in creating a highly reactive biochar which can be applied for different types of biomass with varying properties. This review discusses the factors that affect biochar's reactivity as a catalyst for tar reforming. Additionally, incorporating biochar into a gasification scenario with raw biomass offers a practical solution by leveraging the synergistic behavior. However, this synergy could be either positive or negative: the positive synergy enhances tar removal while the negative synergy has the opposite effect. The numerous factors affecting the results of gasification are presented in this review. It is concluded that the positive synergistic effect resulted from the balance between the available reactants from biomass and biochar, the optimal gas flowrate and the active sites on the carbon surface. Understanding these interactions is crucial for optimizing biochar performance for tar removal. Ultimately, this research provides insights into biochar's role in biomass gasification and suggests improvements for future studies to enhance the feasibility of biomass gasification with the assistance of biochar.
