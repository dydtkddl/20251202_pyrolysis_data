Catalytic co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and Laminaria japonica over zeolitic materials Catalytic co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and Laminaria japonica was carried out using Py-GC/MS and a fixed-bed reactor over different catalysts: HZSM-5, mesoporous MFI, Pt/mesoporous MFI, and mesoporous Al-SBA-16. The contents of oxygenates, acids, and wax species were reduced substantially by catalytic upgrading, whereas the contents of aromatics and light hydrocarbons in the gasoline and diesel range were significantly increased, enhancing the economic value of the bio-oil. Among the catalysts used in this study, Pt/mesoporous MFI showed the highest catalytic upgrading capability, which was attributed to large pore size, strong Brönsted acid sites, and the catalytic effect of added Pt.
