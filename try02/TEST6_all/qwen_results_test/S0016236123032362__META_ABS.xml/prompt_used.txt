You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of needle cokes via mild condition co-pyrolysis of FCC-DO and PFPE The conventional needle coke production process suffers from high reaction temperature and pressure, and therefore, alternative approaches for needle coke production with low energy consumption should be developed. The co-pyrolysis process of FCC decant oil (FCC-DO) and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) was suggested to prepare needle cokes under mild reaction conditions in this work. The characteristics of green pitches and cokes from the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated with XRD, FT-IR, TGA, EA and polarized images to prove the effectiveness of the PFPE-aided reaction in accelerating polymerization. The mixture of FCC-DO and 10 wt% of PFPE was heated to 420, 430, 440, and 450 °C and 1 bar in continuous nitrogen flow, and needle cokes could be successfully derived at a temperature of 440 °C and atmospheric pressure with the addition of PFPE, which are significantly milder conditions compared with prior studies on needle coke production. The reaction mechanism of co-pyrolysis was suggested with radical-based reactions that emerged during the thermal decomposition of PFPE. Furthermore, the electrical and thermal properties of the carbonized needle cokes indicated the superior structural, thermal, and chemical characteristics of PFPE-assisted reaction-derived needle cokes; the needle cokes obtained from PFPE co-pyrolysis showed a 23.5 % reduced CTE value and 7.2 times higher electrical conductivity compared with cokes from pure FCC-DO. Effective needle coke production at a low temperature and pressure could be achieved with a PFPE-assisted co-pyrolysis reaction, and we believe that this study could contribute to a novel method for preparing needle cokes with low energy consumption and extending the applicability of needle cokes by supplying high-quality and low-price needle cokes.
