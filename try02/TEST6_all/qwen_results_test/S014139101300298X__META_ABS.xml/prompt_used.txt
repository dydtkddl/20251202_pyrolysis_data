You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation process investigation of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer in supercritical methanol The depolymerization of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) was investigated in sub- and supercritical methanol. The raw TPU was based on 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA) and extended with 1,4-butanediol (BDO). GC–MS, IR were used in product analysis which shown that the degradation products consisted of the monomers of TPU and their methylates. The quantitative analytical approaches were internal standard method of GC-FID and external standard method of HPLC-UV after derivatization with methanol. The morphological change of the reaction residues in degradation process was observed by SEM, combined with the influences of the degradation temperature and time, the depolymerization mechanisms were proposed, i.e. in HTHP methanol, the degradation started with the broken of the urethane group, the chain of TPU was separated into soft segment and hard segment by transesterification. Subsequently, the transesterification acted between methanol with the urethane group of the hard segment and the ester group of the soft segment, respectively. In the subcritical region, the main products were BDO, dimethyl adipate (DMA), and 4,4′-methylene diphenyl carbamate (MDC) which can be used in the innocuous production of MDI; and BDO, DMA, amines, tetrahydrofuran (THF), macrolides were mainly obtained in supercritical region.
