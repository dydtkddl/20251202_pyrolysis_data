You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The structure of kerogen and related materials. A review of recent progress and future trends Unravelling the chemical constitution of kerogen, asphaltenes, coal and humic substances is the most challenging objective in molecular organic geochemistry. Some compositional constraints are obtained from elemental analysis and from the determination of functional groups or the degree of aromaticity by IR or NMR spectroscopy. Pyrolysis of kerogen or related materials yields small structural units, some of which may be representative of moieties originally present in the macromolecules whereas others may have been formed by secondary reactions. In any case, there is no information on the mode of connection of the various structural units among each other. Chemical degradation of kerogen and related materials so far commonly involved the application of strongly oxidizing reagents (e.g. KMnO4), but also was done by reductive cleavage (hydrogenolysis). Although a variety of methods has been used over the years, much of the work lacked adequate detailed analysis of the reaction products and/or the reactions were not sufficiently specific to allow a reconstruction of larger structural entities. Nevertheless, a combination of elemental analysis, spectroscopic information and chemical data from pyrolysis, bitumen composition in natural rocks and sometimes chemical degradation were used to develop constitutional models of kerogens or asphaltenes of different origins and different levels of thermal evolution. The models at least were internally consistent with respect to the data set used, and although a fair amount of “chemophantasy” may have been incorporated, they certainly stimulated further work. Recently, specific chemical degradation reactions like ether cleavage with boron trichloride followed by lithium aluminium deuteride reduction of the halides or oxidation with ruthenium tetroxide have shown how certain low-molecular-weight products are linked to kerogen or asphaltene macromolecules. Further reactions of this type will have to be looked for. Any attempt to achieve substantial progress in kerogen structure elucidation will require the concerted efforts of (1) consecutive specific chemical degradation reactions, (2) the detailed quantitative molecular analysis of small degradation products, (3) a study of the degradation residues by spectroscopy and pyrolysis, and (4) the application of refined concepts of the preservation of biological macromolecules (e.g. aliphatic biopolymers).
