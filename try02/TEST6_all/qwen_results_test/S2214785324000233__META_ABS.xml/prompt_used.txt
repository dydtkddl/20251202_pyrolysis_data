You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of biomass-plastic blend to high-quality bio-oil via co-pyrolysis using chicken eggshell waste as deoxygenation catalyst: A feasibility study Energy shortages and reliance on fossil fuels have led to the discovery of new technologies to reduce the environmental impact by taking advantage of excess plastic and turning them into usable alternative fuels using the pyrolysis method. However, the oil produced contains highly oxygenated compounds, which are considered a downside to the fuel characteristics, along with a low by-product yield. Therefore, feasibility study of calcined eggshells as a deoxygenation catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch (EFB)/high-density polyethene (HDPE) blend and compare it quantitatively and qualitatively with bio-oil produced using a commercial zeolite-based catalyst, ZSM-5 and Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) at 500 °C operating temperature, 10 ft3/min N2 flow rate, 10 wt% catalyst loading, 1:1 HDPE:EFB ratio and 75 g feedstock with 60 min operating time in a stainless-steel fluidised bed reactor. Natural and calcined chicken eggshells were characterised using TGA/DTG, while the bio-oil produced was characterised using GC–MS. By using FCC catalyst, the highest oil yield (13.2 wt%) with high oxygenated compounds was obtained. The oil with the highest hydrocarbon yield (61.62 %) and lowest oxygenated compound content (38.38 %) was obtained using a calcined chicken eggshell (CES) catalyst. Calcined chicken eggshell (CES) catalysts showed better performance than commercial catalyst in terms of the quality and average yield of bio-oil produced. This study confirmed that the presence of a catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of EFB and HDPE can improve the yield of bio-oil and enhance its quality.
