You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of different metal ions in phosphonitrile-modified organometallic complexes on flame retardancy of epoxy resin Two organometallic (Zn and Fe) coordination compounds, modified by phosphonitrile, were prepared by solvothermal method. The introduction of the two organometallic coordination compounds significantly improved the flame retardancy, smoke suppression and thermal stability of epoxy resins (EP). Especially, zinc-containing coordination compounds exhibited higher efficiency than iron-containing ones in flame-retardant EP. LOI values of Zn-PDH/EP and Fe-PDH/EP were further enhanced and reached up to 29.8% and 28.9%, respectively. Organometallic coordination compounds modified by phosphonitrile mainly exerted the flame-retardant action in condense phase by the combined effect of the catalysis charring effect of metal ions and flame-retardant effect of phosphonitrile, and thus a high-temperature stable graphitized carbon layer with P- and N-containing cross-linking structures formed. This high-quality carbon layer was a vital factor in improving the heat/smoke suppression properties of EP thermosets. Further, due to the weaker catalytic char-forming effect of iron ions and the formation of fewer cross-linked structures, the strength and barrier properties of the Fe-PDH/EP char layer were relatively lower than those of Zn-PDH/EP. Consequently, Zn coordination compounds presented higher efficiency in suppressing heat/smoke release of EP matrix than Fe hybrids. Finally, the gas-phase function of organometallic coordination compounds should not be overlooked due to releasing phosphorus-oxygen free radicals and N-containing fragments during pyrolysis, exhibiting flame inhibition and dilution effect in gas phase, especially for 6%Zn-PDH/EP.
