Unveiling the dynamics of solid waste co-pyrolysis through thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic analysis for technological upscaling (2001–2022) As the rates of population growth and urbanization increase, solid waste management becomes a global challenge, leading to increased research on co-pyrolysis as a sustainable waste management approach. The studies typically begin with thermogravimetric characteristics and kinetic parameter investigations of various feedstock blends. However, a comprehensive examination of the research landscape and future directions of co-pyrolysis kinetics remains lacking in the literature. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of 461 Web of Science-indexed publications was conducted to examine topical developments from 2001 to 2022. The topic experienced rapid growth in terms of total publications and citations. Bioresource Technology is the most productive journal, while Energy Conversion and Management is the most influential. Due to extensive policy frameworks and financial support, China has made the most significant impact on the co-pyrolysis kinetics field. South China University of Technology is the most prolific organization due to Ma Xiaoqian and other productive authors’ efforts. Keyword analysis revealed that co-pyrolysis kinetics research mainly emphasizes investigations on thermal decomposition behaviour, chemical kinetics, bio-product characteristics, and synergistic relationships within feedstock blends. Literature review revealed that co-pyrolysis applications of biomass–plastics and biomass–sludge feedstock blends have received notable attention from researchers. However, blending sludge and plastic wastes still requires further exploration despite its potential. Furthermore, the upscaling of co-pyrolysis experiments relies on thermogravimetric and kinetic analyses for optimal feedstock combination and operating conditions, ensuring maximum synergy and desired bio-products. Overall, the study offers crucial insights for co-pyrolysis industry players, potentially solidifying its role in global waste valorisation roadmaps.
