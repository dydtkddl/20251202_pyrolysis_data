You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling the dynamics of solid waste co-pyrolysis through thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic analysis for technological upscaling (2001–2022) As the rates of population growth and urbanization increase, solid waste management becomes a global challenge, leading to increased research on co-pyrolysis as a sustainable waste management approach. The studies typically begin with thermogravimetric characteristics and kinetic parameter investigations of various feedstock blends. However, a comprehensive examination of the research landscape and future directions of co-pyrolysis kinetics remains lacking in the literature. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of 461 Web of Science-indexed publications was conducted to examine topical developments from 2001 to 2022. The topic experienced rapid growth in terms of total publications and citations. Bioresource Technology is the most productive journal, while Energy Conversion and Management is the most influential. Due to extensive policy frameworks and financial support, China has made the most significant impact on the co-pyrolysis kinetics field. South China University of Technology is the most prolific organization due to Ma Xiaoqian and other productive authors’ efforts. Keyword analysis revealed that co-pyrolysis kinetics research mainly emphasizes investigations on thermal decomposition behaviour, chemical kinetics, bio-product characteristics, and synergistic relationships within feedstock blends. Literature review revealed that co-pyrolysis applications of biomass–plastics and biomass–sludge feedstock blends have received notable attention from researchers. However, blending sludge and plastic wastes still requires further exploration despite its potential. Furthermore, the upscaling of co-pyrolysis experiments relies on thermogravimetric and kinetic analyses for optimal feedstock combination and operating conditions, ensuring maximum synergy and desired bio-products. Overall, the study offers crucial insights for co-pyrolysis industry players, potentially solidifying its role in global waste valorisation roadmaps.
