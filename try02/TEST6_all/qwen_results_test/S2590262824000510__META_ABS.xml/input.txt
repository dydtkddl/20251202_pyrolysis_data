Recent technologies for transforming textile waste into value-added products: A review The disposal of textile waste has become a growing issue worldwide. The rising consumption of clothing and textile materials has resulted in high waste generation. This could adversely impact environmental health, including humans, animals and plants. The three textile recycling methods can be divided into mechanical, chemical, and biological processes. There has been a focus on mechanical and chemical processes, pyrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, biological recycling, and microbial engineering in the area of textile waste managment. This review highlight the important parameters that affect the textile recycling performance and are significant for the success of the transformation process. To reach the zero-waste goal, textile recycling and converting this waste into value-added bioproducts are the necessary steps. The present review addresses the current status of textile recycling strategies, and the valorisation processes for converting textile waste materials into value-added products like biofuels, bioplastics, and others sustainable materials.
