You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel column reactor design for simultaneous photocatalysis and adsorption of 1-naphthol by FeOOH/peroxymonosulfate: Modelling the kinetics and concentration gradient This study demonstrated a simultaneous photocatalysis and adsorption of 1-naphthol by peroxymonosulfate (PMS), FeOOH and UV-C in a novel column reactor, which is composed of a submerged UV-C lamp, mixed quartz bead-FeOOH media bed and a continuous supply of oxidant. Around 80 % of 1-naphthol was removed at its optimal condition. The reaction mechanism was found to be pH dependent. At lower pH, photocatalysis and adsorption are favored as the catalyst surface is protonated (≡FeOH2 +) to promote PMS activation and 1-naphthol adsorption, and the dissolution of Fe3+ enhanced homogeneous activation of PMS. At pH level higher than 8, the reaction becomes retarded due to the deprotonation of catalyst surface and dissociation of 1-naphthol into its conjugate base. Superoxide radical (O2 •-), singlet oxygen (1O2) and sulfate radical (SO4 •-) were confirmed to contribute to 1-naphthol oxidation. The reactor design was optimized at 20 min retention time. Due to the regeneration of FeIII/FeII sites on FeOOH, the performance of reused catalyst is maintained at 90 % after 5 cycles of reuse. A quadratic regression with R2 = 0.929 was used to model the concentration gradient of 1-naphthol along the column at different time intervals.
