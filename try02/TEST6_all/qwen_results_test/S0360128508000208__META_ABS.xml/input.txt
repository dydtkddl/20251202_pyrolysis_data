Agglomeration in fluidized beds at high temperatures: Mechanisms, detection and prevention Fluidized-bed conversion of solid fuels is a well-established and widely used technology. Yet, operational problems are encountered in industrial practice. One of the most important problems is the occurrence of agglomeration at high temperature, meaning that bed particles adhere to each other to form larger entities (agglomerates). This process is often not recognized until sudden defluidization and often leads to a costly shutdown of the whole installation. In particular, the thermal conversion of certain biomass fuels, which is becoming increasingly popular, increases the risk of agglomeration. This paper critically reviews the current research status of this topic in terms of agglomeration mechanisms, detection and counteraction strategies. To understand the complex phenomenon of agglomeration in fluidized beds at high temperatures different areas are distinguished viz. hydrodynamics, chemical reaction mechanisms, particle interaction mechanisms and molecular cramming. Special emphasis is given to the detection of agglomeration. The range of detection methods is comprised of fuel ash analysis methods to predict potential agglomeration as well as analysis methods based on (on-line) process measurements, such as pressure and temperature. Finally, different methods to counteract agglomeration phenomena are presented; they comprise operational measures, utilization of additives, alternative bed materials and improved reactor design.
