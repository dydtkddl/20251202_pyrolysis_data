Hollow carbon spheres as catalyst support for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: synthesis techniques, optimization strategies, and future research The potential of hollow carbon spheres (HCS) as catalyst supports, particularly in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process, is examined in this review. These materials are presently attracting great attention due to their unique properties such as encapsulation ability, controllable permeability, surface functionality, high surface-to-volume ratios, and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. FTS is a pivotal technology for converting carbon monoxide and hydrogen into synthetic fuels and chemicals, but it requires the creation of effective catalyst supports. This review describes the structural benefits and chemical stability of HCS by looking at a wide range of research, emphasizing its effectiveness in comparison to conventional catalyst supports. A critical analysis of the synthesis techniques, optimization plans, and future research avenues sheds light on how HCS can improve catalytic effectiveness and reaction results in FTS. The primary objective of this effort is to stimulate additional research and development in catalyst support materials, paving a path for more sustainable and economically viable processes in the energy sector.
