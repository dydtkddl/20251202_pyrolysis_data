You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxygen-vacancy engineering and junction design in CeO2 nanomaterials for photocatalysis and antibacterial action: A review Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanomaterials occupy a distinctive position in environmental catalysis and antimicrobial technologies because their fluorite lattice accommodates oxygen vacancies and facile Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycling. This review synthesizes recent progress in “defect programming” and junction engineering to convert CeO2 into high-performance platforms for solar-driven pollutant degradation and antibacterial action. We analyze how vacancy ensembles, aliovalent doping, and facet control reshape band structure, extend optical response, and modulate adsorption/activation of O2 and H2O. Emphasis is placed on interfacial designs type-II heterojunctions, direct Z-/S-schemes, and Schottky contacts with metals and conductive carbons that preserve redox potentials while suppressing electron-hole recombination. Synthesis strategies (co-precipitation, hydro/solvothermal, sol–gel/Pechini, microwave/ultrasound, and green/biotemplated routes) are benchmarked for their ability to set vacancy “set-points” and achieve intimate, clean interfaces. We connect characterization toolkits (XPS/UPS, EPR, Raman, UV–Vis DRS, TRPL, EIS/IMPS) to mechanistic fingerprints of reactive oxygen species (•O2⁻, •OH, ¹O2) generation under realistic aqueous conditions. Device-level architectures (immobilized films, polymeric and magnetic frameworks) and reactor/photonic choices are shown to be as determinative as powder composition for durability, separability, and solar utilization. Persistent challenges include disentangling genuine semiconductor pathways from dye/matrix artifacts, stabilizing vacancies in ion-rich waters, and converging on field-relevant metrics beyond decolorization (e.g., TOC mineralization and product inventories). We outline priorities for operando-verified vacancy control, co-design of materials with optics/reactors, robust anchoring and regeneration protocols, and standardized benchmarking to translate CeO2-centered composites into scalable environmental remediation and antibacterial technologies.
