You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and theoretical study of heat and mass transfer in a continuous, vertical and coaxial pyrolysis reactor for high porosity biochar production The development of a high porosity biochar production facility to meet an industrial need requires a detailed knowledge of the thermochemical phenomena of pyrolysis. The main challenge of this work is the production of biochar with a high porosity in large quantities, and producing a residual gas that can be used for drying biomass. Two complementary tools have been here developed and operated: a patented prototype and a designing numerical model. The model was developed in parallel with tests on the prototype and a characterisation phase of the various materials involved in the pyrolysis process in order to increase the correspondence between numerical model and experimental results. The model is used to predict, depending on the geometry chosen, the temperature in the pyrolysis zone, the heating rate and residence time corresponding to the applied biomass flow rate, as well as the biochar and gas mass yields. This study demonstrated the ability of the experimental plant to produce a high porosity biochar with a specific surface of 200 m 2 . g - 1 in the best case and a constant carbon content around 90 % on dry basis due to the separation of the partial oxidation and pyrolysis zones. Following a material characterisation phase and a customisation of the parameters of the Arrhenius formalism adapted to pine bark, the numerical model shows a strong correspondence in terms of temperatures, biochar yield and thermochemical kinetics with the experimental observations from the prototype.
