You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of food waste impurities by catalytic co-pyrolysis for production of pyrolysis oil with high energy potential The emerging impurities (plastic, chopsticks, eggshell and bones) in food waste (FW) due to inefficient source separation have hindered the sustainable treatment and valorization of FW. This study evaluated pyrolysis for converting FW with and without different impurities to produce pyrolysis oil (py-oil). The optimal yield of total condensable vapor (py-liquid) of 37.52 wt% from pure FW was achieved at 400 °C, 20 °C/min and 20 min. Different FW impurities demonstrated varieties of relative content of hydrocarbon (35.53 wt% − 58.03 wt%). The introduction of polypropylene, eggshells and bones improved the organic fraction of py-liquid from 6.5 wt% to 10.7 wt%. Polypropylene enhanced the selectivity of hydrocarbons, while other impurities reduced the hydrocarbon selectivity. Adding treated eggshells and activated biochar as catalysts significantly increased aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon production with higher heating values (HHV) ranging from 36 MJ/kg - 44.44 MJ/kg. The C-H and C-O ratio of py-oil indicated that py-oil has the potential to be processed and utilized like conventional liquid fuel.
