You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MXene/MOF composites: Synergistic platforms for advanced Energy, catalysis, and environmental applications Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) showcase exceptional potential in energy and environmental technologies due to their tunable architectures and molecular selectivity, yet face critical limitations in conductivity and stability. Integrating MOFs with conductive MXenes-2D materials with metallic electron transport and mechanical durability-yields synergistic hybrids that overcome these constraints while preserving MOFs' precision. This review analyzes key synthesis approaches ranging from in-situ MOF growth on MXene surfaces, direct mixing, physical blending, to advanced derivatization methods (including pyrolysis, phosphorization, sulfidation, and selenation), and their applications in energy storage (supercapacitors, multivalent batteries), catalytic conversion (water splitting), and pioneering environmental remediation. Significantly, it addresses prior oversights by detailing MOFs/MXenes' radionuclide capture and heavy metal immobilization via coupled adsorption-redox mechanisms. Emerging frontiers in microwave attenuation and gas separation are also explored, establishing design principles for charge transfer enhancement and stability optimization. The work uniquely bridges material innovation with sustainability demands, identifying scalability challenges and research priorities for next-generation hybrid systems.
