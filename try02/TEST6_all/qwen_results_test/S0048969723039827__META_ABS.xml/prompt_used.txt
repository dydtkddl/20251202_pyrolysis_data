You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into pyrolysis mechanism of plastic waste with C-O/C-N bonds in the backbone Pyrolysis is an important method for efficiently recovering plastic monomers, fuels and chemicals from plastic waste. The depolymerization of the backbone structure of plastic waste is a key step of the pyrolysis process. Currently, researches on the pyrolysis mechanism of plastics with C-O/C-N bonds in the backbone are still not sufficiently in-depth and also lack systematic and comprehensive investigation. Therefore, this study for the first time comprehensively investigated both macroscopic and microscopic pyrolysis processes of plastics with C-O/C-N bonds in the backbone, and evaluated the difficulty of breaking different backbone linkages via bond dissociation energy (BDE) obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to deeply reveal the pyrolysis mechanism. The results indicated that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) had a higher initial pyrolysis temperature and its thermal stability was slightly stronger than nylon 6. The backbone of PET was mainly decomposed via the cleavage of Cα-O on the alkyl side, while the degradation of nylon 6 backbone began with NH2 groups at the end of the backbone. The pyrolysis products of PET were mainly derived from the small molecular fragments, which were generated by the degradation of the backbone through the cleavage of CO bonds or CC bonds, while the pyrolysis products of nylon 6 were always dominated by caprolactam. In addition, based on the results of DFT calculations, it could be inferred that the cleavage of CC bond in PET backbone and the cleavage of its adjacent Cα-O were most likely to occur, which followed a competitive reaction mechanism. However, in pyrolysis of nylon 6, the conversion to caprolactam was mainly via the concerted reaction of amide CN bonds. Compared with the concerted cleavage of amide CN bond, the cleavage of CC bond in the backbone of nylon 6 was not predominant.
