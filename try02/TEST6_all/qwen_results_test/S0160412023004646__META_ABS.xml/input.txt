Particle transfer mediates dermal exposure of consumers to plasticizers in eraser and pen accessories Dermal exposure to chemicals released from daily consumer products is a rising concern, particularly for children who are susceptible to unintentional hand-to-mouth transfer and related chemical exposure risk. However, chemical transfer induced by tiny particles of intact products has yet to be adequately addressed. The objective of the present study was to determine the potentiality of particles release from intact erasers and pen grips upon dermal contact by measuring the migration rates of the embedded plasticizers (phthalates and its alternatives). The results showed that billions of particles were released from erasers (0.6–1.2 × 109) and pen grips (0.2–1.6 × 108) upon dermal contact at ambient temperature, with sizes mainly smaller than 1 μm. The composition of eraser leachates was identical to that of the corresponding bulk eraser, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis. Migrated hydrophobic plasticizers may be used as indicators of particle release from erasers and pen grips. The potentiality of particle release was negatively correlated with the total plasticizer contents (r = −0.51; p < 0.05) for both erasers and pen grips. These findings indicated that particles directly released from school supplies and accessories could be a non-negligible source of human exposure to plasticizers.
