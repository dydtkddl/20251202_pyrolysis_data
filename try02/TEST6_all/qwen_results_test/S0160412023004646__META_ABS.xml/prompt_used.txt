You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particle transfer mediates dermal exposure of consumers to plasticizers in eraser and pen accessories Dermal exposure to chemicals released from daily consumer products is a rising concern, particularly for children who are susceptible to unintentional hand-to-mouth transfer and related chemical exposure risk. However, chemical transfer induced by tiny particles of intact products has yet to be adequately addressed. The objective of the present study was to determine the potentiality of particles release from intact erasers and pen grips upon dermal contact by measuring the migration rates of the embedded plasticizers (phthalates and its alternatives). The results showed that billions of particles were released from erasers (0.6–1.2 × 109) and pen grips (0.2–1.6 × 108) upon dermal contact at ambient temperature, with sizes mainly smaller than 1 μm. The composition of eraser leachates was identical to that of the corresponding bulk eraser, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and pyrolysis. Migrated hydrophobic plasticizers may be used as indicators of particle release from erasers and pen grips. The potentiality of particle release was negatively correlated with the total plasticizer contents (r = −0.51; p < 0.05) for both erasers and pen grips. These findings indicated that particles directly released from school supplies and accessories could be a non-negligible source of human exposure to plasticizers.
