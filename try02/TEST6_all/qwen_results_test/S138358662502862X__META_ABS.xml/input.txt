Carbon dots for multipollutant water treatment: Preparation, features, and applications Carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as a versatile class of nanomaterials with unique structural, optical, and biocompatible properties, enabling their widespread applications in various fields. This work comprehensively reviews the preparation methods, functionalization strategies, structural characteristics, and properties of CDs, focusing on their applications in sensing, adsorption, and catalysis. The critical role of preparation conditions in determining the photoluminescence and surface functionality of CDs is systematically outlined. Furthermore, we thoroughly examine the potential of CDs in pollutant adsorption, catalytic degradation, and environmental monitoring, highlighting the importance of tailoring their properties for targeted applications in environmental remediation. By bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, this review aims to inspire future innovations in the design and utilization of CDs for advanced environmental technologies while addressing the key challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.
