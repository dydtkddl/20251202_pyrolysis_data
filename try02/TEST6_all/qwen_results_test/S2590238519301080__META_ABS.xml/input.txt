Janus Mesoporous Sensor Devices for Simultaneous Multivariable Gases Detection Single-gas-phase chemical detections have recently attracted much attention in diverse fields; however, the pathways of composite sensing systems for detection of multiple gases could provoke better substantial potentials, which have not been fully explored due to the deficiency of feasible integrated sensing platforms. Here, we demonstrate a Janus mesoporous sensor device based on multi-response mechanisms, which can simultaneously detect multiple gases. The sensor devices based on Janus mesoporous carbon/silica films with asymmetric mesostructures and disparate active sites (–NH2 and –COOH groups) can be prepared via a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly and selective functionalization strategy. Such Janus devices have exhibited distinct ultrafast response time under ultralow limit of detection and great selectivity and stability for NH3 and H2S sensing, and each gas concentration can be quantified individually. Theoretical calculation reveals that the distinction of response time is ascribed to the interaction difference to target gases, allowing for distinguished multiple signals.
