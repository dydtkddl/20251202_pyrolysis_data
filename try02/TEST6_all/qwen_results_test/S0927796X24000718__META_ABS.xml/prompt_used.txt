You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ceramics and ceramic composites for biomedical engineering applications via Direct Ink Writing: Overall scenario, advances in the improvement of mechanical and biological properties and innovations The growing demand for personalized ceramic devices for biomedical engineering applications, with increasingly complex shapes and properties, highlights the limitations of traditional ceramic processing techniques. In recent years, increasing attention has been drawn to ceramic-based materials produced by an additive manufacturing method commonly referred to as direct ink writing (DIW) or robocasting. However, the current challenge remains the achievement of strong mechanical reliability while preserving optimal levels of biocompatibility, bioactivity and biodegradability. Hence, the present review examines the overall scenario of this field, highlighting and analyzing the primary outcomes of studies available in the literature. It also describes the most innovative approaches. Were explored pure ceramics and composites, encompassing calcium phosphates, bioactive glasses, calcium silicates, polymer-derived ceramics and functionalized materials. The review demonstrated that DIW was mostly applied for the fabrication of scaffolds intended for bone regeneration applications and that have been, more recently, capable of attaining mechanical properties in the range of cortical bone. Dense components are comprehended as well with high relative densities achieved and commendable mechanical properties in light of the densities attained. Mechanical and biological improvement strategies for the DIW method are also presented and discussed.
