Review of the supercritical water gasification system: Components, challenges and sustainability The supercritical water gasification system is a novel energy conversion technology that has garnered significant interest in recent years for both research and practical use. The system realizes efficient energy conversion and comprehensive resource use by gasifying various organic molecules under high temperature and pressure settings using supercritical water as the medium. The reactor, which is the central part of the system, is responsible for recycling heat effectively and cleanly. Corrosion and obstruction issues have a direct impact on the gasification process’s performance. Furthermore, the coke generated during the gasification process can react with CO2 to produce CO, coke formation is avoided in this process, H2 and CO together are known as syngas.. This can be utilized directly as fuel or converted into a variety of liquid fuels. The potential of supercritical water gasification systems for environmental sustainability and energy conversion are finally discussed, along with the challenges that must be solved before scaling up and going commercial. The purpose of this review is to offer a thorough overview and analysis of the major components of supercritical water gasification systems, including reactor, front-end, and post-treatment processes, in order to offer recommendations and insights for relevant engineering and research projects.
