PVC biodeterioration and DEHP leaching by DEHP-degrading bacteria Newly isolated, not previously reported, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)-degraders were augmented to assess their role in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shower curtain deterioration and DEHP leaching. The biofilms that developed on the surfaces of the bioaugmented shower curtains with Gram-positive strains LHM1 and LHM2 were thicker than those of the biostimulated and Gram-negative strain LHM3-augmented shower curtains. The first derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) peaks of the bioaugmented shower curtains with the Gram-positive bacteria were observed at ∼287°C, whereas the control and Gram-negative strain LHM3-augmented shower curtains were detected at ∼283°C. This slight delay in the first DTG peak temperature is indicative of lower plasticizer concentrations in the shower curtains that were bioaugmented with Gram-positive bacteria. Despite bioaugmentation with DEHP-degraders, aqueous solutions of the bioaugmentation reactors were not DEHP-free due probably to the presence of co-solutes that must have supported microbial growth. Generally, the bioaugmented reactors with the Gram-positive strains LHM1 and LHM2 had greater aqueous DEHP concentrations in the first half (<3 wk) of the biodeterioration experiment than the biostimulated and strain LHM3-augmented reactors. Therefore, strains LHM1 and LHM2 may play an important role in DEHP leaching to the environment and PVC biodeterioration.
