You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of white wine grape pomace through application of subcritical water: Analysis of extraction, hydrolysis, and biological activity of the extracts obtained White wine grape pomace (WWGP) was treated with subcritical water in a semi-continuous reactor, at 170, 190 and 210°C. Assays at 210°C led to highest recovery of carbohydrates (85% of total amount of carbohydrates of WWGP) and phenolic compounds (2.6g/100 gWWGP). Moreover, 48% of initial lignin was solubilized. The amount of carbohydrates recovered increased sharply in the initial stages of the process, due to the extraction of soluble carbohydrates, and then less pronouncedly, as hydrolysis of WWGP took place. The difference in the progress curves for the yields of carbohydrates and of phenolics allowed the separate recovery of carbohydrate-rich, and phenolics-enriched, GP extracts. The latter exhibited 10 times higher antioxidant activity (AA) than a GP extract obtained by hydro-alcoholic extraction, and 8 times lower AA than pure ascorbic acid. WWGP extracts were also found to have 4 times higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria.
