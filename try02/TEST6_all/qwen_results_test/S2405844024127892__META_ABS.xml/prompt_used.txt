You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biocrude from hydrothermal liquefaction of indigenous municipal solid waste for green energy generation and contribution towards circular economy: A case study of urban Pakistan In this study, biocrude was successfully produced by the hydrothermal liquefaction of municipal solid waste collected from the landfill site of Lahore, the capital of Punjab, Pakistan, boasting a population of 12 million and an annual waste collection of 10 million tons. The hydrothermal liquefaction process was performed at reaction parameters of 350 °C and 165 bars with 15 min of residence time. The solid waste was found to have 78 % dry matter, 22 % moisture contents, 22.2 % ash, 22.69 MJ/kg higher heating value, 52.062 % C, 8.007 % H, 0.764 % N, and 39.164 % O. Non-catalytic process only produced 10.57 % oil, however when using the catalytic process, the biocrude yield improved to 17.61 %, with 22.61 % energy recovery for biocrude and 12.14 % for solids, when using 2 g dose of K2CO3. The resultant biocrude has a 28.61 MJ/kg higher heating value, having 60.28 % C and 9.28 % H. In contrast, the aqueous phase generated had 4.43 pH, 71.5 g/L TOC, and 1.35 g/L Total Nitrogen. TGA indicated that biocrude contains approximately 80 % of volatile fractions of different fuels. The organic compounds having the six highest peak areas in GC-MS were Ethyl ether 25.74 %, 2-pentanone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl 9.08 %, 2-propanone, 1,1-dimethoxy 5.62 %, Silane, dimethyl (docosyloxy) butoxy 5.08 %, 1-Hexanol, 2-ethyl 4.53 %, and. Phenol 4.07 %. This work makes the first-ever successful use of indigenous solid waste from a landfill dumping site in Lahore to successfully produce useful biocrude with aims of waste reduction and management, circular economy, and energy recovery.
