You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic upgrading of biomass pyrolysis oil over tailored hierarchical MFI zeolite: Effect of porosity enhancement and porosity-acidity interaction on deoxygenation reactions The catalytic upgrading of beech wood pyrolysis oil has been carried out over microporous and hierarchical MFI zeolites to produce a blendable stream with FCC unit feedstock. Mesoporosity was introduced within the zeolite structure through the desilication process by alkaline NaOH solution with various concentrations aiming at investigating the effect of porosity improvement on catalytic upgrading parameters. The zeolite catalysts were characterized using XRD, SEM, EDS, BET and NH3-TPD analyses and the results showed that the desilication improved textural properties of the zeolites preserving crystallinity. In addition, the effect of mesoporosity, catalyst to biomass ratio, and their interactions on the bio-oil upgrading parameters such as upgrading factor, degree of deoxygenation, effective hydrogen index, relative content of various compounds and coke yield have also been analyzed. The results revealed a significant effect of the parameters on the deoxygenation activity, coke formation potential, and selectivity towards desired products. Indeed, the improved accessibility of weak and strong acid sites, as well as controlled acidity caused to the enhanced conversion of large, oxygenates to smaller ones. The larger coke yield for the optimum hierarchical catalyst (synthesized by 0.5 M solution) was associated with a lower oxidation temperature, which is suited for cost-effective catalyst regeneration.
