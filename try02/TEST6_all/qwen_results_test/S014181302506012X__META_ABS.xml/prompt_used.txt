You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Environmentally friendly upcycling of PHA-based copolymers This work focuses on two fundamental aspects that make the use of plastics and, more recently, bioplastics sustainable and cyclical, namely their recycling and the valorization of the products resulting from this process. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBH) was considered as substrate. A solventless partial chemical decomposition with concomitant branching was developed based on the use of reagents from renewable sources, namely pentaerythritol as polyalcohol and zinc stearate as catalyst. 1H NMR, IR, and DSC measurements showed the formation of oligomers having a branched structure whose molecular weights and glass transition temperatures decreased with the increasing of the polyalcohol content in the reaction mixture. The oligomers were used as additives in the development of porous films based on the starting high molecular weight PHBH, exploiting a Non-Solvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) method using Cyrene®, a green solvent derived from cellulose. The ability of the films to retain a dye and the metal precursor palladium chloride was studied. In the latter case, the catalytic activity of the system consisting of Pd clusters formed on the porous substrate after the metal precursor reduction was demonstrated. Finally, the enzymatic hydrolysis of the films was evaluated using Humicola insolens Cutinase (HiC) at different concentrations and in different media.
