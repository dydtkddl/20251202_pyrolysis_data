You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics and production of epoxy composites with their pyrolysis chars High density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic wastes were pyrolysed in the temperature range of 300–700 °C, liquid, gas and solid fractions (char) were quantified and pyrolysis char was used as additive in production of epoxy composite. Effects of pyrolysis temperature on products fractions, char quality and composite quality were investigated. In the composite composition, char was included as 10–50 wt% of epoxy to determine the effects of additive dosage on the composite quality. The char additives and produced composites were characterized by FTIR and SEM. Mechanical properties, namely tensile strength, surface hardness and electrical properties were determined for the epoxy composite materials. Epoxy composite materials produced with HDPE pyrolysis char additive obtained at 300 °C (ER300) showed the most ideal behavior in terms of elongation at break and tensile strength. With increasing pyrolysis temperature and char doses elongation at break and tensile strength of composites generally decreased. While tensile strength showed an increase by 32% at 10% wt% dose for composite (ER300) with HDPE char obtained at 300 °C, the increases were 21%, 14%, 14% and 13% for ER400-ER700 composites prepared with 10 wt% HDPE chars obtained at 400–700 °C pyrolysis temperatures, respectively. Despite this, LDPE chars a small decreased the tensile strength of epoxy. The hardness of neat epoxy was improved from 79.8 Shore D up to 86.3 and 87 Shore D by the LDPE and HDPE char additives, respectively. The study offers a new recovery approach for HDPE and LDPE type plastic wastes.
