A Comparison of Thermal Processing Strategies for Landfill Reclamation: Methods, Products, and a Promising Path Forward The development of optimized and efficient alternative energy systems that comply with regulatory requirements is a challenge the world needs to embrace. This study provides a systematic review of thermal processing methods to convert lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks, particularly municipal solid wastes, to biofuels. The vast majority of contemporary biorefineries employ combustion systems for energy recovery and to facilitate downstream processing. Following a detailed assessment of existing technologies to develop biorefineries, an innovative system that couples thermal, biochemical and fuel cell technologies to recover useful products and electricity is proposed. The present study targets two key objectives: (1) introducing the fundamental knowledge to understand the concept of thermal technologies for waste processing, and (2) reviewing different types of existing biorefineries and comparing the thermal processing strategies. This study also introduces the concept of the biorefinery landfill—a biorefinery located within a waste disposal site—which represents a sustainable and efficient approach to develop waste resources. This concept could help to drastically reduce the cost of conventional power plants by lowering logistical and supply chain costs related to waste transportation and lowering operating and capital costs by using existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the thermal processing of waste within a landfill aids volume reduction, which will increase the life expectancy of the site and offers the opportunity for energy recovery. The processing options and analysis presented in this study can contribute to initiatives for the development of sustainable bio-power systems and helps to lay the foundation for comprehensive analysis of waste resource use optimization.
