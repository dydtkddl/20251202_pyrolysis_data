You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A Comparison of Thermal Processing Strategies for Landfill Reclamation: Methods, Products, and a Promising Path Forward The development of optimized and efficient alternative energy systems that comply with regulatory requirements is a challenge the world needs to embrace. This study provides a systematic review of thermal processing methods to convert lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks, particularly municipal solid wastes, to biofuels. The vast majority of contemporary biorefineries employ combustion systems for energy recovery and to facilitate downstream processing. Following a detailed assessment of existing technologies to develop biorefineries, an innovative system that couples thermal, biochemical and fuel cell technologies to recover useful products and electricity is proposed. The present study targets two key objectives: (1) introducing the fundamental knowledge to understand the concept of thermal technologies for waste processing, and (2) reviewing different types of existing biorefineries and comparing the thermal processing strategies. This study also introduces the concept of the biorefinery landfill—a biorefinery located within a waste disposal site—which represents a sustainable and efficient approach to develop waste resources. This concept could help to drastically reduce the cost of conventional power plants by lowering logistical and supply chain costs related to waste transportation and lowering operating and capital costs by using existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the thermal processing of waste within a landfill aids volume reduction, which will increase the life expectancy of the site and offers the opportunity for energy recovery. The processing options and analysis presented in this study can contribute to initiatives for the development of sustainable bio-power systems and helps to lay the foundation for comprehensive analysis of waste resource use optimization.
