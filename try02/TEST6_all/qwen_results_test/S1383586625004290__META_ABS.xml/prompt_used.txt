You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics in petrochemical wastewater: A comprehensive review of removal mechanism, influencing factors and effects on wastewater reuse process The petrochemical industry is regarded as a potential source of microplastics release, and the problem of microplastics pollution caused by it cannot be ignored. Although the treatment processes of petrochemical wastewater treatment plants can remove microplastics to a certain extent, there are still a large number of microplastics flowing out with the effluent. In addition, the unique water quality characteristics of petrochemical wastewater may also significantly hinder the effective removal of microplastics. In addition, the demand for wastewater reuse is increasing, and microplastics may have a negative impact on the wastewater reuse treatment based on membrane separation technology. In this paper, the release pathway of microplastics in petrochemical industry, the migration and transformation mechanism of microplastics in petrochemical wastewater treatment plants, the key factors affecting the degradation efficiency of microplastics in petrochemical wastewater, and the potential impact of microplastics on the reuse process of petrochemical wastewater based on membrane separation technology are discussed in depth. The objective is to provide a scientific basis for the effective prevention and control of microplastic pollution in petrochemical wastewater.
