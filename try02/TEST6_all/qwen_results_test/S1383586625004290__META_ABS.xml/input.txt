Microplastics in petrochemical wastewater: A comprehensive review of removal mechanism, influencing factors and effects on wastewater reuse process The petrochemical industry is regarded as a potential source of microplastics release, and the problem of microplastics pollution caused by it cannot be ignored. Although the treatment processes of petrochemical wastewater treatment plants can remove microplastics to a certain extent, there are still a large number of microplastics flowing out with the effluent. In addition, the unique water quality characteristics of petrochemical wastewater may also significantly hinder the effective removal of microplastics. In addition, the demand for wastewater reuse is increasing, and microplastics may have a negative impact on the wastewater reuse treatment based on membrane separation technology. In this paper, the release pathway of microplastics in petrochemical industry, the migration and transformation mechanism of microplastics in petrochemical wastewater treatment plants, the key factors affecting the degradation efficiency of microplastics in petrochemical wastewater, and the potential impact of microplastics on the reuse process of petrochemical wastewater based on membrane separation technology are discussed in depth. The objective is to provide a scientific basis for the effective prevention and control of microplastic pollution in petrochemical wastewater.
