Recent developments in the synthesis of heteroatom-doped and hierarchically porous carbon supercapacitor electrodes from sustainable sources Efficient and affordable supercapacitors play a crucial role in advancing green energy production. Their application in storing electricity generated from renewable sources necessitates optimal electrode materials, impacting capacitance, power density, and cyclic stability. Porous carbon electrode materials (PCEM) with high specific surface area offer substantial charge storage capacity. To enhance the commercial viability of supercapacitors, the focus has shifted towards preparing PCEM-based electrodes using sustainable sources. Recent research has extensively explored biomass from plant, animal, and marine sources, as well as organic molecules, petrochemical residues, and synthetic and natural polymers as sources for PCEM. The typical preparation involves controlled carbonization at elevated temperatures (400 to 1000 °C), while some instances utilize a hydrothermal process. PCEM exhibiting three-dimensional interconnectivity and hierarchical structures prove advantageous, enhancing surface area, charge storage, and mass transfer. Heteroatom-doped PCEM, incorporating elements such as N, O, P, and S, have gained prominence for their ability to improve conductivity and electrolyte wettability. Due to their cost-effectiveness, there is a consensus on developing single step carbonization-activation methods. This review comprehensively discusses recent advancements in the synthesis and performance of heteroatom doped and hierarchically porous PCEM supercapacitor electrodes, with a particular focus on materials derived from agricultural waste, plant parts, marine sources, animal wastes, natural polymers, organic molecules, petroleum residue, and metal-organic frameworks.
