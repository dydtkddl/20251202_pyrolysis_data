You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments in the synthesis of heteroatom-doped and hierarchically porous carbon supercapacitor electrodes from sustainable sources Efficient and affordable supercapacitors play a crucial role in advancing green energy production. Their application in storing electricity generated from renewable sources necessitates optimal electrode materials, impacting capacitance, power density, and cyclic stability. Porous carbon electrode materials (PCEM) with high specific surface area offer substantial charge storage capacity. To enhance the commercial viability of supercapacitors, the focus has shifted towards preparing PCEM-based electrodes using sustainable sources. Recent research has extensively explored biomass from plant, animal, and marine sources, as well as organic molecules, petrochemical residues, and synthetic and natural polymers as sources for PCEM. The typical preparation involves controlled carbonization at elevated temperatures (400 to 1000 °C), while some instances utilize a hydrothermal process. PCEM exhibiting three-dimensional interconnectivity and hierarchical structures prove advantageous, enhancing surface area, charge storage, and mass transfer. Heteroatom-doped PCEM, incorporating elements such as N, O, P, and S, have gained prominence for their ability to improve conductivity and electrolyte wettability. Due to their cost-effectiveness, there is a consensus on developing single step carbonization-activation methods. This review comprehensively discusses recent advancements in the synthesis and performance of heteroatom doped and hierarchically porous PCEM supercapacitor electrodes, with a particular focus on materials derived from agricultural waste, plant parts, marine sources, animal wastes, natural polymers, organic molecules, petroleum residue, and metal-organic frameworks.
