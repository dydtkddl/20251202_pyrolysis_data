Kinetic modeling and optimization of process parameters for gasification of macadamia nutshells with air preheating: A combined use of Aspen Plus and response surface methodology (RSM) This study used Aspen Plus process simulation for sensitivity analysis to identify the range of parameters for subsequent optimization using response surface methodology, to maximize syngas combustible gases and higher heating value (HHV) while minimizing tar. From the analysis of variance, equivalence ratio (ER) was the most significant parameter affecting H2 and CH4 production, HHV and tar content while pressure contributed the least. Air temperature influenced CO production the most while ER had the least effect. For a pressurized gasifier operating at 4 atm, optimal ER and air temperature was 0.16 and 575 °C respectively, producing syngas with HHV and tar content of 4.3 MJ/Nm3 and 23.68 g/Nm3 respectively. Optimal ER and air temperature for atmospheric pressure gasifier were 0.15 and 445 °C respectively, resulting in syngas with HHV and tar content of 4.14 MJ/Nm3 and 29.17 g/Nm3 respectively. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data.
