You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading recovered carbon black (rCB) from industrial-scale end-of-life tires (ELTs) pyrolysis to activated carbons: Material characterization and CO2 capture abilities The current study presents for the first time how recovered carbon black (rCB) obtained directly from the industrial-scale end-of-life tires (ELTs) pyrolysis sector is applied as a precursor for activated carbons (ACs) with application in CO2 capture. The rCB shows better physical characteristics, including density and carbon structure, as well as chemical properties, such as a consistent composition and low impurity concentration, in comparison to the pyrolytic char. Potassium hydroxide and air in combination with heat treatment (500–900 °C) were applied as agents for the conventional chemical and physical activation of the material. The ACs were tested for their potential to capture CO2. Ultimate and proximate analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and N2/CO2 gas adsorption/desorption isotherms were used as material characterization methods. Analysis revealed that KOH-activated carbon at 900 °C (AC-900K) exhibited the highest surface area and a pore volume that increased 6 and 3 times compared to pristine rCB. Moreover, the AC-900K possessed a well-developed dual porosity, corresponding to the 22% and 78% of micropore and mesopore volume, respectively. At 0 °C and 25 °C, AC-900K also showed a CO2 adsorption capacity equal to 30.90 cm3/g and 20.53 cm3/g at 1 bar, along with stable cyclic regeneration after 10 cycles. The high dependence of CO2 uptake on the micropore volume at width below 0.7–0.8 nm was identified. The selectivity towards CO2 in relation to N2 reached high values of 350.91 (CO2/N2 binary mixture) and 59.70 (15% CO2/85% N2).
