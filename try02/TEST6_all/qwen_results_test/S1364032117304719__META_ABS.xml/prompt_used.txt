You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prospects for pyrolysis technologies in the bioenergy sector: A review Pyrolysis is a promising technology for converting biomass into renewable biofuels. This study provides an overview of ongoing efforts and advances as well as environmental and economic aspects of this technology. In pyrolysis, lignocellulosic biomass is converted to biochar or biooil. The potential to reduce life cycle greenhouse gases from pyrolysis depends on the feedstock used, the conversion technology, the size of the pyrolysis unit, and the way co-products are used. Slow pyrolysis may provide greater environmental benefits because it produces more biochar which can be applied to soil to improve its quality and to sequester carbon. However, fast pyrolysis has a better economic return because of the production of higher value products. The profitability of pyrolysis depends on feedstock costs, product yields, the ability to produce higher value products, and production scale. Mobile pyrolysis technologies may be a solution to reduce the feedstock logistics challenges because they allow the production of bioenergy at the sources of feedstock. Technological advances need to be coupled with renewable energy policy to expand pyrolysis renewable energy production. However, any investment in this technology should consider a broader sustainability analysis to mitigate environmental and economic risks.
