Prospects for pyrolysis technologies in the bioenergy sector: A review Pyrolysis is a promising technology for converting biomass into renewable biofuels. This study provides an overview of ongoing efforts and advances as well as environmental and economic aspects of this technology. In pyrolysis, lignocellulosic biomass is converted to biochar or biooil. The potential to reduce life cycle greenhouse gases from pyrolysis depends on the feedstock used, the conversion technology, the size of the pyrolysis unit, and the way co-products are used. Slow pyrolysis may provide greater environmental benefits because it produces more biochar which can be applied to soil to improve its quality and to sequester carbon. However, fast pyrolysis has a better economic return because of the production of higher value products. The profitability of pyrolysis depends on feedstock costs, product yields, the ability to produce higher value products, and production scale. Mobile pyrolysis technologies may be a solution to reduce the feedstock logistics challenges because they allow the production of bioenergy at the sources of feedstock. Technological advances need to be coupled with renewable energy policy to expand pyrolysis renewable energy production. However, any investment in this technology should consider a broader sustainability analysis to mitigate environmental and economic risks.
