You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of pretreatment biomass by gas from polyvinyl chloride dehydrochlorination process on maize cob pyrolysis with integrated CO2 capture This study investigates the effects of pretreatment of maize cob with hydrogen chloride gas obtained from polyvinyl chloride dehydrochlorination on pyrolysis yields and integrated CO₂ capture. The dehydrochlorination process was conducted at 320 °C, while the pyrolysis of the pretreated biomass was performed at 500 °C. Pretreatment significantly altered composition of biomass, reducing hemicellulose from 34.3 % to 3.7 %, increasing fixed carbon from 15.8 % to 20.3 %, and increasing the chlorine content from 0.27 % to 1.48 %. These changes influenced on the thermal decomposition characteristics of maize cob. During fast pyrolysis, the bio–oil yield increased by 17 %, from 32.9 % to 38.4 %, while gas production decreased from 38.7 % to 30.3 %, indicating a shift towards liquid biofuel production. Integration of calcium hydroxide in the pyrolysis reactor reduced CO₂ emissions by 87 %, from 56.5 % to 7.5 %, and captured chlorine from the pyrolysis gases, minimising harmful residues. Additionally, the use of calcium hydroxide facilitated the generation of hydrogen, increasing its content to 44.7 % in the gas phase. The bio–oil produced contained 0.8 % chlorine, demonstrating the effectiveness of in–situ chlorine capture. This approach, utilising hydrogen chloride derived from polyvinyl chloride waste, not only reduces environmental impact but also enhances the efficiency and sustainability of bio–oil production.
