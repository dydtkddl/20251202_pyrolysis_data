You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-syringe magnetic dispersive µSPE exploiting magnetic almond shell biochar@ZIF-8 for parabens determination by UHPLC-UV An in-syringe magnetic dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (MD-µSPE) system followed by UHPLC-UV analysis has been developed exploiting a hybrid sorbent based on magnetic alkali-activated almond shell biochar (MAASB), which is used as a support for in-situ growth of ZIF-8 (MAASB@ZIF-8), for the extraction and preconcentration of parabens (PBs) in environmental water and urine samples. Experimental designs were employed to optimize the pyrolysis conditions for biochar production, including temperature, heating rate, and residence time, and several parameters affecting extraction efficiency, e.g., pH, extraction time, ionic strength, eluent type, elution time and eluent volume. Under optimized conditions, the method showed detection limits between 0.05 and 0.09 ng mL−1 for methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl paraben. The precision expressed as RSD (n = 3) showed intraday and interday ranges of 2.2–4.7 % and 2.6–4.3 %, respectively, demonstrating the good precision of the proposed methodology. Recovery studies were performed in the absence and presence of PBs spiked at different concentrations (10–30 ng mL−1), yielding good recoveries in the range of 88–104 %. These results confirm that MAASB@ZIF-8 is an efficient sorbent for the determination of PBs, offering high porosity, magnetic responsiveness, and stability. Furthermore, the proposed method was evaluated with AGREE, ComplexMoGAPI, and BAGI metrics, evidencing its environmentally friendly approach, as well as the practicality of the method compared to previous works.
