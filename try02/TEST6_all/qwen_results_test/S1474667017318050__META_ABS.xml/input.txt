Challenges in Polymerization Reactor Modeling and Optimization: A Population Balance Perspective In the present article, recent developments on modeling, monitoring, optimization and control of particulate polymerization processes are reviewed. A unified population balance approach is described to follow the time evolution of molecular and morphological polymer properties in batch and continuous polymerization reactors. Recent advances on the online monitoring of “polymer quality” are discussed in the context of available hardware and software sensors. The problem of real-time optimization of polymerization processes under parametric uncertainty is also examined along with its online implementation. Finally, new issues related with the modeling, numerical solution and control of multidimensional PBEs are conferred.
