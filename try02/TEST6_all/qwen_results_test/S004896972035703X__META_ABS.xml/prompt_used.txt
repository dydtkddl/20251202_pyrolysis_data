You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of torrefaction and ZSM-5 catalyst for hydrocarbon rich bio-oil production from co-pyrolysis of cellulose and low density polyethylene via microwave-assisted heating This study aims to investigate the effect of microwave torrefaction and ZSM-5 catalyst for hydrocarbon rich bio-oil production from microwave co-pyrolysis of cellulose and low density polyethylene (LDPE). FTIR analysis displayed remarkable reductions of active hydroxyl and ether groups in microwave torrefied cellulose (MTC), demonstrating that cellulose was less stable than MTC. GC/MS analysis indicated that the hydrocarbons content was ranged from 18.36% to 54.94% in the obtained bio-oils under different conditions, and the maximum hydrocarbons content (54.94%) which also contained the highest aromatic hydrocarbons (19.49%) was obtained from MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis. Microwave-assisted Thermogravimetric analyzer (MW-TGA) analysis showed that MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis apparently shifted the major thermal degradation to a lower temperature area, an evident synergistic effect was observed during MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis. Kinetics study revealed that the activation energy was significantly reduced from 97.87 kJ/mol to 63.86 kJ/mol for co-pyrolysis and MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis, respectively.
