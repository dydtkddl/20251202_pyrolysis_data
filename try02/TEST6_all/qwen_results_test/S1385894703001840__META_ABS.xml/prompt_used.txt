You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics of polystyrene and polypropylene in a stirred batch reactor Kinetic tests on pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) were carried out with a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique at the heating rate of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0°Cmin−1 in a stirred batch reactor. The polystyrene was mainly decomposed between 370 and 410°C at the heating rates, whereas the polypropylene between 400 and 460°C. The apparent energy of activation and the apparent order of reaction were determined at conversions from 1 to 100%. The ranges of apparent energies of activation of polystyrene were from 164 to 249kJmol−1 at conversions in the range of 1–100% and the apparent order of reaction was 0.32. The apparent energies of activation of polypropylene increased slowly from 208 to 288kJmol−1 and the apparent order of reaction was 0.01. The effects of heating rate on the product distribution have been studied. The selectivity of hydrocarbons corresponding to the styrene monomer and dimer was very high for the pyrolysis of polystyrene. The selectivity of specific hydrocarbons, however, was not observed for the case of polypropylene.
