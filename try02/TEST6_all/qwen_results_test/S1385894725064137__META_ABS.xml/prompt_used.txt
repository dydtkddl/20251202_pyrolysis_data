You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon microsphere-modified MXene: A high-efficiency hybrid flame retardant for simultaneously enhancing fire resistance, smoke suppression and thermal conductivity in poly (L-lactic acid) Two-dimensional layered MXene nanosheets represent a promising environmentally friendly and efficient flame retardant. However, MXene tends to aggregate readily in polymer matrices, which compromises the mechanical and flame-retardant properties of the resulting composites. Carbon microspheres (CMSs), with their diverse surface-active functional groups, provide an effective solution to address this challenge. Furthermore, the carbon-rich CMSs enhance the flame retardancy of composites through their catalytic carbonization effect. In this work, we achieve for the first time the uniform loading of CMSs onto MXene nanosheets via electrostatic self-assembly. This innovative strategy effectively resolves the dispersion challenges of MXene in polymer matrices and enables its incorporation into poly (l-lactic acid) (PLA) systems. Remarkably, with only 5 wt% MXene/CMSs loading, the PLA/MXene/CMSs composite exhibited improved mechanical properties, and the thermal conductivity of the PLA composite was increased to 0.31 W∙m−1∙K−1, which was 47.6% higher than that of Neat PLA. In addition, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) increased to 26.6%, achieving a V-0 rating in the UL-94 vertical burning test. Compared to neat PLA, the composite demonstrated reductions of 28.1% and 15% in the peak heat release rate (pHRR) and total heat release (THR), respectively. Notably, the total smoke release (TSR) decreased significantly by 70.4% relative to Neat PLA. Additionally, a more stable and compact char layer formed during combustion. This enhancement primarily originates from the markedly improved dispersion of flame retardants in the PLA matrix, the catalytic carbonization effect mediated by transition metal Ti in MXene, and the efficient carbonization capability of CMSs. This work provides an advanced and eco-friendly solution to address the trade-off between MXene aggregation in polymers, high flame-retardant efficiency, smoke suppression, thermal conductivity and mechanical performance.
