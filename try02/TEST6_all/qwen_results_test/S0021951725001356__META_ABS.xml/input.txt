The role of the Pt-group dehydrogenation catalyst in alkane metathesis for polyolefin deconstruction Recent proposed approaches in the depolymerization of waste plastics employ an olefin intermediate to produce alkanes or alkenes using olefin metathesis in tandem chemistry. Here we investigated the role of the dehydrogenation catalyst on reaction rate, kinetics, and product distribution in heterogeneous tandem dehydrogenation and olefin metathesis (alkane metathesis) of three different alkane reactants, including polyethylene. We found that many properties to which alkane dehydrogenation rates were sensitive—including metal composition, nanoparticle size, and surface doping of Re species also controlled activity in Tandem D/OM. When comparing Pd, Pt, and Pt3Sn1, supported Pd in tandem with a Re2O7 olefin metathesis catalyst showed four-fold higher activity (surface area basis) compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 catalysts on the same support, mainly due to differences in the rate of hydrogenation. Catalyst preparation resulted in metal nanoparticles partially covered by ReOx, as seen from elemental mapping. Co-location of Re2O7 and Pd correlated with increased rates of hydrogenation (i.e., an increase in the rate of alkane formation and simultaneous lowering of the rate of alkene formation), with a reaction order in catalyst study that further supported this conclusion. The Pd and Re2O7 system displayed marked improvement compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 with Re2O7, and previous work, in the depolymerization rate of a linear polyethylene feedstock, with over 94 % reduction in polymer molecular weight in 15 h at 190 °C using less catalyst and increased reactant loadings, while keeping solvent to polymer consumption below 2.5.
