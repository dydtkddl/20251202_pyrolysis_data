You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of the Pt-group dehydrogenation catalyst in alkane metathesis for polyolefin deconstruction Recent proposed approaches in the depolymerization of waste plastics employ an olefin intermediate to produce alkanes or alkenes using olefin metathesis in tandem chemistry. Here we investigated the role of the dehydrogenation catalyst on reaction rate, kinetics, and product distribution in heterogeneous tandem dehydrogenation and olefin metathesis (alkane metathesis) of three different alkane reactants, including polyethylene. We found that many properties to which alkane dehydrogenation rates were sensitive—including metal composition, nanoparticle size, and surface doping of Re species also controlled activity in Tandem D/OM. When comparing Pd, Pt, and Pt3Sn1, supported Pd in tandem with a Re2O7 olefin metathesis catalyst showed four-fold higher activity (surface area basis) compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 catalysts on the same support, mainly due to differences in the rate of hydrogenation. Catalyst preparation resulted in metal nanoparticles partially covered by ReOx, as seen from elemental mapping. Co-location of Re2O7 and Pd correlated with increased rates of hydrogenation (i.e., an increase in the rate of alkane formation and simultaneous lowering of the rate of alkene formation), with a reaction order in catalyst study that further supported this conclusion. The Pd and Re2O7 system displayed marked improvement compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 with Re2O7, and previous work, in the depolymerization rate of a linear polyethylene feedstock, with over 94 % reduction in polymer molecular weight in 15 h at 190 °C using less catalyst and increased reactant loadings, while keeping solvent to polymer consumption below 2.5.
