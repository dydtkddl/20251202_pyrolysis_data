You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cs, V, Cu Keggin-type catalysts partially oxidize 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol to methacrylic acid Heteropoly acids are among the best catalysts to produce carboxylic acids from light hydrocarbons. The Keggin structure maintains metals at a high oxidation particularly in the presence of cesium, vanadium, and copper. They effectively catalyze the partial oxidation of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (2MPDO)—a co-product in the hydroformylation of allyl alcohol to 1–4 butanediol. Converting 2MPDO to methacrylic acid would improve the economics of this route to 1–4 butanediol. Here, we establish the relationship between heteropoly acid performance and calcination temperature at 300 °C and 350 °C. The molybdenum oxidation state was higher after the high temperature treatment but it reduced to a greater extent during reaction (from Mo6+ to Mo5+). The higher extent of reduction confirms the higher O2− → Mo6+ charge-transfer in the Keggin anion. Maximum MAA and MAC selectivities were 61% and 28%, respectively, at 250 °C after 480 min over cycling oxidation–reduction and 2MPDO/O2/Ar = 13/10/77 as the best reaction condition and feed composition. Though, the route of direct dehydration of 2MPDO (C–OH bond cleavage) followed by oxidation to MAC is the most direct path to the products detected, we propose a mechanism that passes through the homolytic dissociation of the tertiary C–H bond,considering that bonding energies energies are very similar.
