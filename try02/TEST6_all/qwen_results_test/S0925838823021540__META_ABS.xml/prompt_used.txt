You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Free-standing N-doped hollow carbon fiber encapsulate P/GeP hybrid anode for rechargeable Li-ion battery Red phosphorus (RP) with appropriate working voltage and high lithium storage specific capacity has been considered as high-performance anode for Li-ion battery (LiB). However, the volume expansion of the RP anode reached 350 % during the intercalation/deintercalation of Li-ion processes, resulting in the detachment of active material and poor specific capacity. Herein, flexible hollow nanochannel carbon nanofiber was prepared through simple electrospinning, then P/GeP nano powder were encapsulated in the N-rich carbon nanofiber using a facile in situ synthesis method, where the introduction of GeP not only innovatively served as the high conductive dispersant for P, but simultaneously acted as the active component in reacting with Li-ion. The unique designed nanoarchitecture not only boosted the structural stability and electronic conductivity of the hybrid composite, but also facilitated the transport of electrons and Li-ion. Upon served as free-standing LiB anode, the N-doped hollow carbon fiber encapsulate P/GeP (P/GeP/C) anode displayed remarkably reversible capacities, superior rate performances, and long-term cycle stability for lithium storage. For instance, P/GeP/C of only 10.6 wt% GeP and 28.5 wt% P delivered 290.2 mA h g−1 under a high current density of 5 A g−1 and showed a high capacity of 575.6 and 436.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and 1.0 A g−1 after 50 cycles, respectively.
