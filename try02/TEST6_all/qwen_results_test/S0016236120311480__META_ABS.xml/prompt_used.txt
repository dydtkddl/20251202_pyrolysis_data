You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling and simulation of coupled pyrolysis and gasification of oily sludge in a rotary kiln Oily sludge is considered as hazardous material which has a negative impact on environment and human health. Pyrolysis and gasification are effective technologies for the utilization of oily sludge. In this work, the coupled pyrolysis and gasification process of oily sludge in a rotary kiln was simulated. The material motion equations, heat transfer equations and kinetics equations were used to model the pyrolysis process, while the mass equations and energy equations were used to model the gasification process. The successive and simultaneous reactions were investigated. In the successive reaction, CH4 yield has a peak of 3.25% at the initial temperature of solid heat carrier of 1167 K. At higher temperatures, CH4 yield decreased and CO and H2 became the dominant fuel gases, with the yields of 7.49% and 1.81% at 1400 K, respectively. A heat value peak of 525 kJ was observed at 1187 K. In the simultaneous reactions, high temperature promoted the yields of gaseous products. The yields of gaseous products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, CO and H2) increased rapidly with increasing temperature (3.65%, 0.035%, 4.01%, 0.76% and 0.66% at 1400 K). The highest heat value was 517 kJ at the initial temperature of solid heat carrier of 1400 K.
