You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nickel-decorated ZIF-67 (Co) MOF derived bi-metallic catalyst for efficient degradation of tetracycline under microwave irradiation through persulfate activation route: Performance assessment and predictive intermediate toxicity profile In this study, tetracycline (TC) removal performance evaluation was accomplished alongside the prediction of the eco-toxicological effect of the generated intermediates. The polyhedron shaped nickel (Ni)-decorated ZIF-67 (Co) MOF derived bi-metallic catalyst was synthesized successfully by pyrolysis of the Ni-modified rhombic dodecahedron shaped ZIF-67 template. Therefore, under the following microwave (MW) based operation conditions: catalyst dose 0.6 g/L, initial concentration of TC 10 mg/L, MW input power 450 W, and at unchanged pH, Ni-decorated ZIF-67 (Co) derived catalyst Ni Co /C displayed ∼97.59 % TC removal within only 2 min of MW exposure. Magnetic (i.e., Ni and Co) and dielectric (i.e., carbon) counterparts enhanced better microwave absorption while reducing reflective loss. The absorbed microwave energy was dissipated to form localized ‘hotspots’ for direct decomposition of PS, H2O, and TC molecules whereas conductive carbon matrix with Ni doping propagated electronic mobility for free reactive radical generation. The MW induced ‘photo-electric’ effect of electron-hole pair separation and electron transfer via redox couples (i.e., Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+) encapsulated in carbon nanocage resulted in the generation of various reactive free radicals including sulfate (SO4 •−), hydroxyl (●OH), superoxide anion (●O2 –) radicals and singlet oxygen (1O2) which were confirmed by EPR. The theoretical eco-toxicological effects of intermediates were analyzed by ECOSAR and T.E.S.T. software, which may highlight the need for stringent rules in the future regarding the discharge of advanced oxidation process-treated wastewater and further research on the mitigation process. Moreover, the reusability study and evaluation of TC degradation in natural water showcased the calibre of this Ni-decorated ZIF-67 (Co) derived catalyst Ni Co /C to become a next-generation MW-responsive catalyst to tackle various emerging contaminants.
