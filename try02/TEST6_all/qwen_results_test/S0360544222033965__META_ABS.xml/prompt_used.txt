You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification of waste PET, PP and biomass for energy recovery: A thermodynamic model to assess the produced syngas quality Co-gasification of plastics with biomass is an attractive energy-recovery option to handle the plastic waste generated by society and requires further study. This work presents a simulation-based analysis of the air co-gasification of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and biomass (straw) using different combinations (PP/PET, PP/biomass, PET/biomass and PP/PET/biomass) and proportions, temperatures (650–850 °C), and equivalence ratios (0.25–0.45). A thermodynamic equilibrium model based on the Cantera chemistry toolbox and Python scripting was used in the simulations. Results indicate that increasing the proportion of plastics in the gasification feedstock increases the gas heating value (to a maximum of 5.78 MJ/Nm3) and tar contents (to a maximum of 72.89 g/Nm3). Additionally, it was found that PET is the plastic that adds the least value to the gas because of its lower heating value and tendency to form tar. Moreover, when gasifying a mixture of PP/PET/biomass, the gas H2/CO ratio decreases with temperature (from 1.91 at 650 °C to 1.14 at 750 °C and an equivalence ratio of 0.25), an aspect of particular importance for the end-use of the syngas. From the simulation results, a surrogate model was computed, and a series of response surface and polynomials were produced.
