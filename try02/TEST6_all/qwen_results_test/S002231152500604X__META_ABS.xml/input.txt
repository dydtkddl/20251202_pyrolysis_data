Evaluation of tungsten as diffusion barrier for high-density U-Mo fuel using heavy-ion irradiation Monolithic plate-type nuclear fuels for research reactors based on a U-Mo alloy require a coating barrier between the fuel zone and the Al-based cladding to suppress the growth of the undesired interaction layer. The effectiveness of tungsten - an alternative to the commonly used zirconium - is studied to this end. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) serves as a suitable method to produce the required barrier layers. These W coatings turn out brittle, especially when combined with a subsequent cladding application, but show promising behavior in limiting thermal diffusion. This is confirmed in heavy-ion irradiation experiments to simulate in-pile performance of the fuel system. Irradiation of the W barrier from the direction of the Al cladding as well as from the U-Mo side displays mainly interaction of W and Al. As observed, a layer of 1 µm W is sufficient to prevent interaction of U-Mo and Al up to fission density equivalents of 7.5·1020 fissions/cm³. The temperature effect dominates the growth of interaction layer when the sample temperature is increased from 140 °C to 200 °C.
