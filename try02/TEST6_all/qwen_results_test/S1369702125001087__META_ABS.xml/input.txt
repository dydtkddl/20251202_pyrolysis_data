Emerging microfluidics for bioreactor Bioreactor, as a representative in vitro biotechnology, has been widely applied to construct native tissue-mimic culture microenvironment. The microfluidics within bioreactor system are imparted with numerous merits like homogeneous flow field, constant fluidic stimuli and efficient mass transport, and thus broaden the avenues for three-dimensional cell culture and construction of artificial organs to satisfy the extensive demands of biomedical applications. Herein, this review focuses on the recent research progress made with respect to emerging microfluidics for bioreactors, involving hydrodynamics theoretical models of microfluidics, multi-dimensional microfluidic scaffolds, dynamic microfluidics integrated within different types of bioreactors, and practical applications of bioreactors in the field of biomedical science. Further, perspectives on the remaining challenges and future research directions for the development of microfluidic bioreactors are also presented.
