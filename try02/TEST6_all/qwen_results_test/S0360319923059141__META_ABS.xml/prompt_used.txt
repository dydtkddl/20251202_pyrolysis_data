You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic modeling and performance analysis on co-gasification of Chlorella vulgaris and petrochemical industrial sludge via Aspen plus combining with response surface methodology The co-gasification process of Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and petrochemical industrial sludge (IS) was uncoupled and simulated by Aspen Plus. The co-gasification process was considered into drying, pyrolysis, partial oxidation, as well as reduction and reforming. Simulation results showed that, the interactions between IS and CV were found for the differences in CHO, and affected by the IS ratio and gasification temperature. Increasing the temperature could improve the CO content, and get optimal H2 at 700 °C, while decrease CO2 and CH4 contents, thus lead to a higher LHV (lower heating value) of syngas, CGE (cold gas efficiency), and syngas content, CO selection. The higher S/IS-CV (steam to IS-CV blends ratio) value favored H2 production but reduce CO content and CGE. As air equivalent ratio (ER) increased, the H2 content constantly reduced, while CO varied slightly when the ER was lower than 0.10. After the ER value was higher than 0.10, CO reduced and thereby decreasing co-gasification performance. When the drying degree of feedstock increased, the CO content continuously increased, leading to better co-gasification performances. The RSM results showed that the significance factors in the interactions are ER and drying degree, S/IS-CV and ER, gasification temperature and ER, and gasification temperature and ER, respectively for CGE, LHV, C syngas, and Sel CO.
