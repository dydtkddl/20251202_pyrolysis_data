You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of removal technologies for microplastics in surface waters and wastewaters Microplastics and the even more elusive nanoplastics are now recognized as ubiquitous, persistent, and potentially toxic contaminants in surface waters and wastewaters. Despite growing attention, real-world mitigation remains limited. This critical review interrogates the performance, scalability, and lifecycle implications of the principal removal technologies reported between 2016 and 2025. Although the size-exclusion membranes remain the benchmark for absolute removal efficiency (>95% for MPs <0.5 µm), they incur the highest unit-energy demand and chronic fouling. High-affinity sorbents, including Zr-based metal–organic frameworks, graphene-oxide hybrids, and engineered biochars, achieve 90–97% removal at far lower energy input, yet their lifecycle viability hinges on closed-loop regeneration and avoidance of polymer desorption. Magnetic composites (e.g. Fe₃O₄-ZIF-8) deliver near-quantitative capture (∼98%) within minutes, but field-scale demonstrations and robust magnet-recovery protocols are still lacking. Coagulation and electrocoagulation offer the most cost-effective high-throughput solutions (77–98%) but shift the plastic burden into metal-rich sludges. Advanced oxidation processes uniquely mineralize plastics (≤98.4%) albeit at high reagent and energy cost, while nature-based strategies (microbial consortia, hyperthermophilic composting, constructed wetlands) deliver 40–90% removal over longer residence times and remain highly sensitive to environmental variability. Across all classes, nanoplastic (<100 nm) retention is the weakest link, underscoring the need for standardized detection, nanoscale-selective materials, and pilot-scale validation. To support effective implementation, we identify key research priorities, including fouling control, sorbent regeneration, sludge valorization, catalyst stability, and risk assessment, and propose an integrated treatment hierarchy that couples low-energy bulk removal with targeted polishing and safe end-of-life management.
