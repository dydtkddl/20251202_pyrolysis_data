Characterization of PBDD/F emissions from simulated polystyrene insulation foam via lab-scale programmed thermal treatment testing Accidental fires and open combustion are regarded as major potential contributors to the environmental release of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). The characterization of PBDD/Fs emitted from thermal treatment of simulated polystyrene (PS) foam is reported in this study. PS, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and metals (or metallic compounds) composed the test samples, which imitated real extruded (XPS) and expanded (EPS) polystyrene thermal insulation foams. Test samples were subjected to thermal treatments under different experimental conditions. This study shows that the temperature, metal (metallic compound) content, and type of atmosphere are the key factors in the formation of congeners and PBDD/Fs during thermal processes. The total yield of polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDFs) was greater than that of the polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) during the test, and 1,2,3,7,8-PeBDF and 2,3,7,8-TBDF were the predominant congeners emitted during the thermal treatment experiments.
