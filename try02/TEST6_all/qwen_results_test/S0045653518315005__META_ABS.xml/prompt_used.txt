You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of PBDD/F emissions from simulated polystyrene insulation foam via lab-scale programmed thermal treatment testing Accidental fires and open combustion are regarded as major potential contributors to the environmental release of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). The characterization of PBDD/Fs emitted from thermal treatment of simulated polystyrene (PS) foam is reported in this study. PS, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and metals (or metallic compounds) composed the test samples, which imitated real extruded (XPS) and expanded (EPS) polystyrene thermal insulation foams. Test samples were subjected to thermal treatments under different experimental conditions. This study shows that the temperature, metal (metallic compound) content, and type of atmosphere are the key factors in the formation of congeners and PBDD/Fs during thermal processes. The total yield of polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDFs) was greater than that of the polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) during the test, and 1,2,3,7,8-PeBDF and 2,3,7,8-TBDF were the predominant congeners emitted during the thermal treatment experiments.
