You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An egg-tray structural interface photothermal evaporator based on carbonized waste cotton and electrospun recycled PET Nowadays, global freshwater scarcity and waste fabric surplus have been more and more serious. Therefore, using waste textiles to manufacture seawater desalination will achieve environmental and economic significance. In this study, the waste cotton fabric was carbonized into biochar powder under 600°Cin a tube furnace. The carbonized cotton fabric (CCF) powders were mixed into recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) solution and then electrospun into CCF@rPET photothermal membranes. The as-spun CCF@rPET membranes were then assembled into an egg tray structural interface photothermal evaporator. The prepared egg tray structural CCF7@rPET-P evaporator could achieve a seawater evaporation rate about 1.994 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 solar intensity (1 kW/m2) and a conversion efficiency about 114.5 %. The evaporator could produce 6.37–12.11 kg/m2 clean water daily, sufficient to meet adults' daily water demand. Meanwhile, the material cost of the evaporator was about 1.3 $/m2, with a photothermal quality factor about 3.63, higher than most reported materials. These results suggested that waste cotton textiles could be used as an excellent photothermal material after carbonization, combining with the electrospun nanofibrous membrane, then providing a greener way for desalination. This approach would benefit the future recycling of waste fabrics and freshwater harvesting.
