An egg-tray structural interface photothermal evaporator based on carbonized waste cotton and electrospun recycled PET Nowadays, global freshwater scarcity and waste fabric surplus have been more and more serious. Therefore, using waste textiles to manufacture seawater desalination will achieve environmental and economic significance. In this study, the waste cotton fabric was carbonized into biochar powder under 600°Cin a tube furnace. The carbonized cotton fabric (CCF) powders were mixed into recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) solution and then electrospun into CCF@rPET photothermal membranes. The as-spun CCF@rPET membranes were then assembled into an egg tray structural interface photothermal evaporator. The prepared egg tray structural CCF7@rPET-P evaporator could achieve a seawater evaporation rate about 1.994 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 solar intensity (1 kW/m2) and a conversion efficiency about 114.5 %. The evaporator could produce 6.37–12.11 kg/m2 clean water daily, sufficient to meet adults' daily water demand. Meanwhile, the material cost of the evaporator was about 1.3 $/m2, with a photothermal quality factor about 3.63, higher than most reported materials. These results suggested that waste cotton textiles could be used as an excellent photothermal material after carbonization, combining with the electrospun nanofibrous membrane, then providing a greener way for desalination. This approach would benefit the future recycling of waste fabrics and freshwater harvesting.
