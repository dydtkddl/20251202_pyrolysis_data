You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis and techno-economic evaluation of co-pyrolysis of medical protective clothing and biomass With the increasing global energy demand and the worsening issue of energy shortages, the energy crisis has become a significant challenge worldwide. Meanwhile, the disposal of medical and agricultural waste is also becoming an increasingly critical issue. Medical waste, such as protective clothing, contains hazardous substances that, if improperly managed, pose threats to the environment and public health. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, not only consume high amounts of energy but also make it difficult to recover energy and materials from the waste. To address these problems, this study proposes a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution, aiming to convert hazardous medical waste into valuable fuel products such as CH4, H2, and CO through pyrolysis technology. In this regard, the study conducted a series of simulation experiments to analyze the pyrolysis of medical protective clothing (MPC), cow dung (CD), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and corn straw (CS) under different temperature and mixing conditions. The results show that the pyrolysis of MPC alone predominantly produces char (accounting for around 50%). Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC enhances the product yield. For example, at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC increases the methane (CH4) yield by 12% compared to the pyrolysis of MPC alone. Additionally, a life cycle assessment and a techno-economic evaluation were conducted from an application perspective. The results indicate that the project is economically feasible with net profits achievable in the second year of operation and has no harmful environmental impacts. Converting medical waste, agricultural waste, and other types of waste into biofuels holds the potential for being green, economical, and sustainable. This approach not only reduces reliance on traditional energy sources but also contributes to achieving carbon neutrality and promoting green development goals.
