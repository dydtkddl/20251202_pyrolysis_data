Analysis and techno-economic evaluation of co-pyrolysis of medical protective clothing and biomass With the increasing global energy demand and the worsening issue of energy shortages, the energy crisis has become a significant challenge worldwide. Meanwhile, the disposal of medical and agricultural waste is also becoming an increasingly critical issue. Medical waste, such as protective clothing, contains hazardous substances that, if improperly managed, pose threats to the environment and public health. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, not only consume high amounts of energy but also make it difficult to recover energy and materials from the waste. To address these problems, this study proposes a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution, aiming to convert hazardous medical waste into valuable fuel products such as CH4, H2, and CO through pyrolysis technology. In this regard, the study conducted a series of simulation experiments to analyze the pyrolysis of medical protective clothing (MPC), cow dung (CD), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and corn straw (CS) under different temperature and mixing conditions. The results show that the pyrolysis of MPC alone predominantly produces char (accounting for around 50%). Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC enhances the product yield. For example, at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC increases the methane (CH4) yield by 12% compared to the pyrolysis of MPC alone. Additionally, a life cycle assessment and a techno-economic evaluation were conducted from an application perspective. The results indicate that the project is economically feasible with net profits achievable in the second year of operation and has no harmful environmental impacts. Converting medical waste, agricultural waste, and other types of waste into biofuels holds the potential for being green, economical, and sustainable. This approach not only reduces reliance on traditional energy sources but also contributes to achieving carbon neutrality and promoting green development goals.
