You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regeneration of coked zeolite from PMMA cracking process by ozonation Regeneration of coked ZSM-5 zeolite was performed by oxidation with ozone at low temperature range (<150°C) so that to restore catalytic activity. Physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized by several techniques: thermogravimetry (nature of coke deposit), elemental analysis (carbon content), porosimetry (surface area and pore size), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption and pyridine adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy (acidity). Reactions were carried out at various temperatures, gas hourly space velocities and inlet concentrations of ozone. They showed that partially coked samples (containing 3wt.% of C) can be successfully regenerated by ozone with carbon removal up to 80%. Carbon removal is improved by increasing the inlet ozone concentration in the range 16–50g/m3, with almost linear trend, and by increasing time on stream until it plateaus after 2h. Coke oxidation with O3 starts at low temperature and exhibits an optimum at about 100°C. At higher temperatures, the rate of ozone decomposition becomes much faster than its pore diffusion rate, so that radical species are no longer available for the coke deposit within the particles and the overall oxidation yield decreases. Indeed, catalytic decomposition of ozone is found to occur significantly above 100°C: O3 decomposition reaches 90% with fresh ZSM-5 catalyst. Thus regeneration of coked zeolite particles involves both complex chemical reactions (coke oxidation and O3 decomposition to active but unstable species) and transport processes (pore diffusion to the internal coked surface). Ozonation can restore both textural and acidic properties, allowing the catalyst to almost recover its initial activity in poly(methyl metacrylate) cracking. The activity results are well correlated with the carbon removal efficiency.
