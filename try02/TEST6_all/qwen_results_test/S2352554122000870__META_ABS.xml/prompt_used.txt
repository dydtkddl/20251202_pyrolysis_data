You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Economic feasibility of plastic waste conversion to fuel using pyrolysis Plastics that are difficult to mechanically recycle can be chemically recycled by pyrolysis into petrochemical feedstock that can be used either as fuel or as a starting material for chemicals or polymers. The objective of this study is to assess the economic feasibility of converting post-consumer plastics to fuel or oil using pyrolysis, and to assess the processing and market conditions required for a successful deployment of pyrolysis technologies. The economic feasibility of converting plastic waste to oil/fuel using pyrolysis is evaluated using as criteria the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The Lang factor method is used to estimate the cost of the plant (capital and operating cost). Capital expenditures (CapEx), operating expenses (OpEx), and revenue generated by the sale of product are estimated. US market conditions (i.e., feedstock cost, feedstock transportation cost, volume of feedstock available, taxes, wages, tipping fees) are taken into account in estimating operational costs. The plants were evaluated at three scales: 30 tons per day (TPD), 60 TPD, and 100 TPD, each with the option of sourcing feedstock at the current market price (Case 1) or at no cost (Case 2). Investment decisions based on entity basis (unlevered NPV), show the plants can be profitable at scales higher than 60 TPD in both Case 1 and Case 2. However, on equity basis, using current market conditions for analysis, the 30 TPD plant has a negative NPV in both cases, and the 60 TPD and 100 TPD plans are profitable in Case 2 but not in Case 1. Profitability of plastic-to-fuel conversion using pyrolysis is influenced by crude oil prices, feedstock costs, CapEx and OpEx, discount rates, and operating hours.
