Recent developments of nanocarbon based supports for PEMFCs electrocatalysts Nanocarbons, widely and commonly used as supports for supported Pt-based electrocatalysts in PEMFCs, play a significant role in Pt dispersion and accessibility, further determining their corresponding electrocatalytic performance. This paper provides an overview of the nanoarchitectures and surface physicochemical properties of nanocarbons affecting the electrocatalyst performance, with an emphasis on both physical characteristics, including pore structure, and chemical properties, including heteroatom doping and functional carbon-based supports. This review discusses the recent progress in nanocarbon supports, guides the future development direction of PEMFC supports, and provides our own viewpoints for the future research and design of PEMFCs catalysts, advancing the commercialization of PEMFCs.
