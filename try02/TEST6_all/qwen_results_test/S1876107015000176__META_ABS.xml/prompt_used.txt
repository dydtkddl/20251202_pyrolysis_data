You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of polyethylene terephthalate on the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene: Investigation of the liquid products Safe and environmentally benign treatment and disposal of waste plastics are growing challenges of our society. In this paper, the influence and reactivity of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on the pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) is reported. The experiments were performed in a quartz glass reactor to determine the effects of temperature (250–500 °C), reaction time (20–90 min), and feed to catalyst ratio (1:0–1:0.3) using 20% Al-Al₂O₃ catalyst. PS pyrolyzed at a lower temperature than thermogravimetric (TG) pyrolysis in the presence of catalysts. Significant interactions between the polymers were noted based on the composition of liquid product. Increasing the composition of PET reduced the liquid products formed. Many useful compounds such as benzene, styrene, α-methylstyrene, indene, biphenyl, naphthalene, naphthalene derivatives and terphenyls etc. and some oxygenated compounds such as 2-pentanone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl, acetophenone, 2-buten-1-one, 1-phenyl and 1,2-propanediol, 3-benzyloxy-1,2-diacetyl etc. were identified. Single ring aromatic hydrocarbons (C6–C9 fraction) particularly that of styrene monomer, were dominant products.
