Highly efficient catalytic O3 oxidation degradation of levofloxacin by peanut shell pyrolysis-modified red mud wastes In recent years, the research and development of efficient and practical new technologies for sewage treatment, especially the efficient removal of toxic, harmful and difficult-to-degrade pollutants, is a scientific frontier and hot issue in the environmental field. In this study, an efficient catalyst PS-RM method was derived from a facile pyrolytic modification of red mud with peanut shells. Catalytic degradation of levofloxacin (LEV) by O3 oxidation can reach a catalytic efficiency of >98 % in 50 min. Meanwhile, the results also demonstrated that the PS-RM method exhibits an excellent catalytic activity when treating the real pharmaceutical wastewater. PS-RM is also highly stable over long periods and is safe for the leaching of small amounts of heavy metals. In addition, the concentration of O3 and hydroxyl radical (•OH) in the liquid phase increases significantly. And then, it can enhance the oxidation effect. This study provides an effective means for the treatment of difficult-to-degrade organic wastewater and the realization of resource utilization of industrial wastewater.
