You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass for the bio-oil production with ZSM-5: Focus on structure A higher amount of oxygenated compounds in bio-oil obstructs its use in the existing petroleum-based infrastructures. In order to convert oxygenates into hydrocarbons and less reactive compounds, a number of catalysts have been studied in the catalytic fast pyrolysis. The ZSM-5 catalyst has drawn a considerable attention due to its potential to yield high quality bio-oil that is rich in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and deficient of oxygenating species. This review has focused on shape selectivity of ZSM-5 towards improving the quality of bio-oil from catalytic fast pyrolysis. The uniform pore size, unique channels equipped with elliptical and near-circular openings, mesoporosity, and tunable acidity are considered as the most selective for the production of aromatics and also are responsible for deoxygenation reaction. It has been revealed that pyrolysis intermediates diffuse into ZSM-5 pores and undergo catalytic cracking on the active sites while cleavage of CO and CC bonds releases oxygen and further transformation produces aromatic hydrocarbons and small molecular weight compounds. Furthermore, total acidity and the number of acid sites (Bronsted and Lewis acid) of ZSM-5 can be tuned that is promising rather than other acid catalysts for catalytic fast pyrolysis. At last, the catalytic effects of parent and modified ZSM-5 catalysts have been summarized. This review will carry the potential for the selection of catalyst with better understanding of pore size that will be a forwarding approach in the area of catalytic pyrolysis.
