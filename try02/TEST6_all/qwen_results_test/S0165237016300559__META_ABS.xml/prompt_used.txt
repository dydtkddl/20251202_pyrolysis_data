You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins with waste motor oil The co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins [waste polyethylene (PE) and waste polypropylene (PP)] with waste motor oil (WMO) was performed at different ratios under a nitrogen atmosphere at 500°C. The effects of WMO on the pyrolysis of waste polyolefins and their blends were investigated under identical conditions. The addition of WMO into waste polyolefins not only increased the liquid yields but also improved the properties of liquid products. In the most cases, the co-pyrolysis process had a positive synergistic effect on the liquid yields when compared with the calculated co-pyrolysis yields. The naphtha and paraffinic contents of the liquid products obtained from the co-pyrolysis of PE/WMO, PE/PP/WMO blends were higher than liquid products obtained from the pyrolysis of the individual waste polyolefins. The trace elements as well as heavy metals in the liquid products from the pyrolysis of WMO alone or the co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins with WMO were observed to be lower than the WMO feed. The prominent gas products obtained from the pyrolysis of individual waste polyolefins and WMO or the co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins/WMO blends were hydrocarbons and hydrogen. The heating values of the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis gases were found to be in the range of 27.6–32.4MJNm−3.
