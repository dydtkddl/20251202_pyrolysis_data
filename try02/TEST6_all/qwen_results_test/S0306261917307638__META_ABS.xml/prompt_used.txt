You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Torrefaction of a solid recovered fuel (SRF) to improve the fuel properties for gasification processes This work studies the torrefaction of a solid recovered fuel (SRF) and its effect on the fuel properties for gasification. The SRF (namely FL) was torrefied at two temperatures (290°C and 320°C) in a pilot auger reactor (capacity of up to 100kg/h) and evaluated as a gasification feedstock. This evaluation included the characterization of the obtained torrefied materials (FL290 and FL320) and several gasification tests in a bench-scale fluidized bed reactor. These tests were performed with different gasification agents (air and oxygen/steam) and bed materials (sand, dolomite and olivine) at similar experimental conditions (T=850°C and ER∼0.3). The evaluation of the gasification performance was presented in terms of product yields and gas composition together with the release of contaminants. Tar species (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and minor contaminants (H2S, HCl, HCN and NH3) were analysed by gas chromatography and ion-selective potentiometry, respectively. Additionally, the calculation of the process efficiency (gasification and its combination with torrefaction) based on the energy content of the producer gas and a preliminary cost analysis that evaluate the main benefits and drawbacks of the torrefaction process are included. The results indicated that the torrefaction process improved the SRF gasification parameters (lower tar, higher H2/CO ratio, carbon conversion, etc.) and strongly affected the presence of HCl in the producer gas. However, the preliminary cost analysis advised the combination of both technologies only under certain gasification conditions.
