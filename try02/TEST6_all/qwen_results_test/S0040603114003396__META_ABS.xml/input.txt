Potential kinetic model for thermal decomposition of complex organic compounds: Significance of parameters and engineering application This paper analyzes the significance of the apparent activation energies and the reaction orders in potential kinetic models, their great interrelation and their influence in the design of reactors. The interrelation between the pre-exponential factor, the apparent activation energy and the reaction order is considered for a single reaction model and for a scheme of reactions. In addition, some simulated results of schemes of reactions were correlated satisfactorily by a single reaction model with surprising results concerning the activation energy and the reaction order. The potential model is compared with other correlation models proposed in literature. Finally, an analysis is presented on the use of the kinetic parameters for the design of industrial reactors.
