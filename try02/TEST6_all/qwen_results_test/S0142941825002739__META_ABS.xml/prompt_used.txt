You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tunable product selectivity in co-pyrolysis of mixed plastics: Enhancing olefin selectivity and optimizing oil yield via synergistic effects The co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) offers a novel strategy for the selective conversion of waste plastics into high-value olefins.This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics, kinetic parameter calculations, synergistic interactions, and product distributions of HDPE/LDPE mixtures at ratios of 1:1 (HL11), 1:3 (HL13), and 3:1 (HL31), and reveals the underlying mechanism by which synergistic effects govern product selectivity during co-pyrolysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the HDPE/LDPE mixture with a 3:1 ratio (HL31) exhibits the most significant synergistic enhancement. The co-pyrolysis of HL31 shows the lowest activation energy (212.44 kJ mol−1), consistent with the random nucleation and growth model (A 3/2 ). Product analysis further reveals that the HL31 pyrolysis achieves an oil yield as high as 85 %. The interaction between free radicals generated from HDPE and LDPE decomposition suppresses alkane formation while promoting the retention of olefins, thereby enhancing the overall yield of olefins such as 2,4-dimethyl-1-decene and 1-decene. This study elucidates the ratio-dependent synergistic mechanism in HDPE/LDPE co-pyrolysis, providing a theoretical basis for the selective conversion of mixed plastic waste. By tuning the component ratio, simultaneous optimization of pyrolysis oil yield and olefin selectivity can be achieved, advancing the industrial application of plastic recycling technologies.
