You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating use of metal-modified HZSM-5 catalyst to upgrade liquid yield in co-pyrolysis of wheat straw and polystyrene Co-pyrolysis of wheat straw (WS) and polystyrene (PS) at a weight ratio of 1:1 was conducted in a fixed bed reactor. The effect of ex-situ application of HZSM-5 and its metal modified versions (MZSM-5s) on organic liquid product (OP) upgradation was explored. MZSM-5s were synthesized by adding metal (Co, Ni, Zn, and Fe) oxides to parent HZSM-5 catalyst through wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, and N2 physisorption. In the first phase, the effect of co-pyrolysis temperature (500–650 °C) on product distribution was evaluated. The liquid yield varied in the range of 49–55 wt%, with a maximum at 550 °C. In the second phase, results obtained from vapor catalyzed co-pyrolysis conducted at 550 °C showed that impregnation of HZSM-5 with metals resulted in relatively higher OP oil yield as compared to parent HZSM-5. Co-ZSM-5 produced maximum OP yield (39.0%) followed by Zn-ZSM-5 (38.2%), Fe-ZSM-5 (37.7%) and Ni-ZSM-5 (36.1%). Whilst, the coke yield was reduced for all MZSM-5s by approximately 50%. Moreover, the addition of metals significantly favored the catalytic selectivity towards monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). Fe-ZSM-5 proved to be most the effective catalyst exhibiting the highest de-oxygenation potential (97.4%) and displaying maximum MAHs content (83.3%). Simultaneously, MZSM-5s reduced undesirable polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yield noticeably.
