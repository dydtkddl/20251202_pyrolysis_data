You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The current progress of tandem chemical and biological plastic upcycling Each year, millions of tons of plastics are produced for use in such applications as packaging, construction, and textiles. While plastic is undeniably useful and convenient, its environmental fate and transport have raised growing concerns about waste and pollution. However, the ease and low cost of producing virgin plastic have so far made conventional plastic recycling economically unattractive. Common contaminants in plastic waste and shortcomings of the recycling processes themselves typically mean that recycled plastic products are of relatively low quality in some cases. The high cost and high energy requirements of typical recycling operations also reduce their economic benefits. In recent years, the bio-upcycling of chemically treated plastic waste has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional plastic recycling. Unlike recycling, bio-upcycling uses relatively mild process conditions to economically transform pretreated plastic waste into value-added products. In this review, we first provide a précis of the general methodology and limits of conventional plastic recycling. Then, we review recent advances in hybrid chemical/biological upcycling methods for different plastics, including polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethane, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride. For each kind of plastic, we summarize both the pretreatment methods for making the plastic bio-available and the microbial chassis for degrading or converting the treated plastic waste to value-added products. We also discuss both the limitations of upcycling processes for major plastics and their potential for bio-upcycling.
