The current progress of tandem chemical and biological plastic upcycling Each year, millions of tons of plastics are produced for use in such applications as packaging, construction, and textiles. While plastic is undeniably useful and convenient, its environmental fate and transport have raised growing concerns about waste and pollution. However, the ease and low cost of producing virgin plastic have so far made conventional plastic recycling economically unattractive. Common contaminants in plastic waste and shortcomings of the recycling processes themselves typically mean that recycled plastic products are of relatively low quality in some cases. The high cost and high energy requirements of typical recycling operations also reduce their economic benefits. In recent years, the bio-upcycling of chemically treated plastic waste has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional plastic recycling. Unlike recycling, bio-upcycling uses relatively mild process conditions to economically transform pretreated plastic waste into value-added products. In this review, we first provide a précis of the general methodology and limits of conventional plastic recycling. Then, we review recent advances in hybrid chemical/biological upcycling methods for different plastics, including polyethylene terephthalate, polyurethane, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride. For each kind of plastic, we summarize both the pretreatment methods for making the plastic bio-available and the microbial chassis for degrading or converting the treated plastic waste to value-added products. We also discuss both the limitations of upcycling processes for major plastics and their potential for bio-upcycling.
