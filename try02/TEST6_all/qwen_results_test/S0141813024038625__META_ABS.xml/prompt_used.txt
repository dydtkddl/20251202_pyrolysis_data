You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The improvement of flame retardancy and compatibility of PBAT/PLLA via a hybrid polyurethane Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)/poly (L-lactic acid) (PBAT/PLLA) is one of the most important biodegradable polymer combinations; however, they are flammable with heavy melt dripping and incompatible. To achieve the objective of flame retardation and compatibility, a hybrid polyurethane (PU) with multiple flame retardation elements is synthesized via a new ring-opening polymerization (ROP) method and integrated into PBAT/PLLA film. The PU not only dissolves in different organic solvents at mild temperature but also improves the compatibility of PBAT/PLLA. As PU with respect to PBAT/PLLA is 20 wt%, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL-94 reach 25.5 % and V-0 rating, respectively. In cone calorimeter test, the peak heat release rate (pHRR) of PU/PBAT/PLLA is ahead of PBAT/PLLA, and the total heat release (THR) decreases to 25.85 MJ/m2. The fire safety is achieved successfully. The initial pyrolysis of PU promotes the formation of a seed carbon layer; it continuously breaks down into a series of phosphorus‑oxygen radicals and generates different inert gases, while the pyrolytic solid products accelerate the carbonization to form the carbon/silicon composite layer. Then the polymeric combustion is braked completely. Besides, the PU can also tune the mechanical properties of PBAT/PLLA film and enhance its hydrophobicity. This work opens a new window for developing multifunctional flame retardant and paves the way for the richening engineering application of PBAT/PLLA.
