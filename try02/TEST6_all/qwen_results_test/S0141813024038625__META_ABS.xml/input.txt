The improvement of flame retardancy and compatibility of PBAT/PLLA via a hybrid polyurethane Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)/poly (L-lactic acid) (PBAT/PLLA) is one of the most important biodegradable polymer combinations; however, they are flammable with heavy melt dripping and incompatible. To achieve the objective of flame retardation and compatibility, a hybrid polyurethane (PU) with multiple flame retardation elements is synthesized via a new ring-opening polymerization (ROP) method and integrated into PBAT/PLLA film. The PU not only dissolves in different organic solvents at mild temperature but also improves the compatibility of PBAT/PLLA. As PU with respect to PBAT/PLLA is 20 wt%, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL-94 reach 25.5 % and V-0 rating, respectively. In cone calorimeter test, the peak heat release rate (pHRR) of PU/PBAT/PLLA is ahead of PBAT/PLLA, and the total heat release (THR) decreases to 25.85 MJ/m2. The fire safety is achieved successfully. The initial pyrolysis of PU promotes the formation of a seed carbon layer; it continuously breaks down into a series of phosphorus‑oxygen radicals and generates different inert gases, while the pyrolytic solid products accelerate the carbonization to form the carbon/silicon composite layer. Then the polymeric combustion is braked completely. Besides, the PU can also tune the mechanical properties of PBAT/PLLA film and enhance its hydrophobicity. This work opens a new window for developing multifunctional flame retardant and paves the way for the richening engineering application of PBAT/PLLA.
