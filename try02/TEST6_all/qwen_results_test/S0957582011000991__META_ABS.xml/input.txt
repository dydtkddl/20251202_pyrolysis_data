Waste as alternative fuel – Minimising emissions and effluents by advanced design This paper reviews the utilisation of waste as an alternative fuel, commonly referred to as Waste-to-Energy (WTE). The paper contains a comprehensive survey of the literature published in this field with comparative analysis of different approaches and methods. The main features and properties of municipal and industrial waste have been analysed as these can vary significantly from location to location and year to year. The paper discusses the applicability and limitations of current and developing WTE technologies as well as new and emerging WTE technologies and the recent developments in design of for producing heat, power and fuels. Methodologies that are considered include criteria for technology selection, together with procedures that comply with the environmental EC regulations Best Available and Best Applicable Techniques (BREFs).
