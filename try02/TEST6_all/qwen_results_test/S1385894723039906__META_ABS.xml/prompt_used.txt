You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Contaminant removal from plastic waste pyrolysis oil via depth filtration and the impact on chemical recycling: A simple solution with significant impact Recycling of mixed plastic waste via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking towards light olefins is a promising solution for the ever-growing plastic waste crisis. However, the pyrolytic recycling pathway is still not established on industrial scale due to the large variety of pyrolysis oil contaminants that hamper the application in (petro-)chemical processes. In short, plastic waste pyrolysis oils are unfeasible for steam crackers without upgrading. In this work, depth filtration for the removal of particulate contamination from a post-consumer mixed polyolefin (MPO) pyrolysis oil was performed using three different filter media with different porosity. Comprehensive analyses using SEM-EDX of the retained particles as well as ICP-OES and GC × GC-FID of the filtered oils allowed to understand the efficacy of filtration. Most of the particulate contamination was removed by filtration leading to a reduction from 69 mg/L in the unfiltered sample to < 2 mg/L in the filtered samples. Particle characterization confirmed that the main contamination is composed of iron, calcium and silicon-based contaminants in combination with carbon-based species. It was confirmed by ICP-OES that after filtration, important contaminants such as nickel, vanadium and lead were reduced below contamination thresholds for steam crackers indicating that filtration is an efficient, and potentially cost-effective upgrading technique for pyrolysis oils. When steam cracking the filtered oils, results show that radiant coil coke formation was reduced by 40–60% compared to the unfiltered oil without changes in product selectivity, confirming the strong impact of particulate contamination on coke formation during steam cracking.
