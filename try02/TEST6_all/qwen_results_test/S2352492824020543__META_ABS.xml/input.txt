Continuous synthesis of sulfomethylated alkali lignin in microreactor and its slurry properties Coal water slurry (CWS) is a clean liquid fuel and dispersant plays an important role for CWS preparing, storage, transportation and gasification. To improve the synthesis efficiency of dispersant and optimize the preparation process of CWS, a T-type rectangular microreactor was designed to prepare sulfomethylated alkali lignin (SAL). The preparation process was optimized by response surface method based on the conditions: the amount of formaldehyde solution 20–30 %, the amount of sodium sulfite 15–20 %, the reaction temperature 75˚C to 85˚C, and the residence time 250 s to 450 s. The differences in sulfonic acid group content, thermal stability, wettability and surface tension between SAL and alkali lignin (AL) were compared. The results showed that the sulfur content increased from 3.196 % to 5.920 %, and the contact angle between coal and water significantly reduced. Compared to the traditional process, the SAL synthesized in microreactor can reduce viscosity and increase the maximum solid concentration of CWS.
