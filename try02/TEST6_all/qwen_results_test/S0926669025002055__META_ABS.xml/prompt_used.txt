You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Drying kinetic and upgraded grindability of biomass with torrefaction-assisted deep drying Deep drying can effectively improve the grindability of biomass. However, the effects of drying characteristics and pretreatment conditions on grindability during deep drying are not clear. In this study, eucalyptus wood (EW) pellets were pretreated with torrefaction assisted deep drying using a horizontal fixed-bed reactor. The drying and grindability characteristics of eucalyptus wood were studied by response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that when the temperature increased from 200℃ to 230℃, all absorption peaks of eucalyptus wood particles increased while the internal connectivity was weakened. Large quantities of cellulose began to decompose when the temperature further increased to 260℃, which made the particles show a rich porous structure, and the grindability was improved. The energy provided by deep drying could be utilized by a large number of water molecules inside eucalyptus wood particle, and the large kinetic energy of water molecules significantly enhanced the outward migration speed of internal water molecules. As the eucalyptus wood particle size decreased, the diffusion resistance also decreased. The operating conditions were optimized by Box-Behnken design (BBD) and a pretreatment temperature of around 290℃, a particle size of 0.3–0.6 mm with a residence time of around 30 min were recommended to produce eucalyptus wood particle with good fuel and grindability properties.
