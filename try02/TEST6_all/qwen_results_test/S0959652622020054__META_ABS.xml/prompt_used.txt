You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cotton farming sustainability: Formation of trans-isoeugenol/ bio-aromatics, 5-chloromethylfurfural, C13–C17 liquid hydrocarbons & fertilizer from cotton gin trash We have examined a sustainable biorefinery process for the conversion of cotton gin trash (CGT), a waste from the cotton industry to multiple high value products. Herein, we found CGT native lignin to have unique features as it not only contains the p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacol (G) and syringol (S) units, but structures of flavonoids, tyrosine, and phenylalanine associated with it. We have used the lignin-first approach to exploit its features in CGT and depolymerize it using argon gas and ethanol over Pd/C. The results show that 50% of the bio-aromatics is trans-isoeugenol, a precursor to produce vanillin. The cleavage of N-compounds from CGT during the fractionation process follows similar path as the rate of formation of the bio-aromatics. CGT impurities were shown to affect the reusability of the Pd/C catalyst. The fractionated cellulose-rich portion of CGT was converted to 39 mol% (80% purity) of 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF), and a solid fuel which has a higher heating value of 20 MJ kg−1. The liquid extract, removed prior to CGT processing, was hydrogenated to produce C13–C17 liquid hydrocarbons, and the solid extract rich in nutrients is suitable for crops and plants growth.
