You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of coal pyrolysis kinetics for Barracuda or Ansys Fluent In the present work different methodologies have been used to analyze pyrolysis of a German bituminous coal “Auguste Victoria” with the aim to obtain pyrolysis kinetic submodels suitable for combustion models developed under Barracuda or other CFD environment such as Ansys Fluent. Intrinsic kinetics have been obtained by conventional TGA analysis at low heating rate (2–20 K/min) and with small particle size (in the order of 0.1 mm) and described by a two-step pyrolysis model. Additionally, the rates of pyrolysis were measured under fluidized bed conditions for larger particle size fractions using a method based on the time-resolved measurement of pressure in the freeboard induced by volatiles release and by a flow restriction at the exhaust. Results of thermogravimetric experiments have been worked out to obtain submodels of coal pyrolysis, comparing and discussing alternative reaction networks of different complexity. However, in fluidized bed experiments, using larger particle sizes, transport limitations become important. As expected, for this regime the reactions rates become lower the larger the particle size, reducing the relevance of intrinsic kinetic submodels.
