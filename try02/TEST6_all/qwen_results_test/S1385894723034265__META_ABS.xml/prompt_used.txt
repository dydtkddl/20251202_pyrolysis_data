You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of the process parameters of catalytic plastic pyrolysis for oil production using design of experiment approaches: A review Catalytic pyrolysis of plastics to produce oil has attracted substantial scientific attention owing to its renewability, environmental sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. This research intended to compare the efficiency of statistical optimization techniques such as response surface methodology (RSM) and the Taguchi method for optimizing catalytic plastic pyrolysis reactions and the parameters’ impact on oil production. The catalyst-to-plastic ratio and various types of acidic catalysts, such as synthetic zeolites and spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts, are the key factors regulating the optimal values of pyrolysis parameters, including reaction temperature (nearly 500 °C) and residence time (15–20 min), as well as oil yield (80–90%). The Lewis and Brønsted acid sites of zeolite or spent FCC or Si/Al enhance the bond breakage of long-chain hydrocarbons. Unlike the acidic sites in zeolites, the acidic sites in Si/Al appear weaker, even though the Taguchi optimization technique indicates that Si/Al is more actively producing oil than zeolite/FCC catalysts. Under similar pyrolysis conditions, polystyrene (PS) thermally breakdowns more efficiently and yields more oil than polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), as PS contains branched side chains that can break at low temperatures due to their low activation energy for bond-breaking. The order of the contribution of different parameters determined by the Taguchi techniques is catalyst types > plastic types > pyrolysis temperature. Nevertheless, this sequence of parameters contribution could vary depending on the experimental conditions. Non-catalytic pyrolysis has a longer optimal residence time yet yields less oil. RSM has more trials, which makes them more trustworthy techniques.
