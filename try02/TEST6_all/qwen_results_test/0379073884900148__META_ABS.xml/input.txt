Comparative analysis of synthetic polymers using combinations of three analytical methods The use of three analytical techniques for forensic investigation of synthetic polymers is described. These techniques are: pyrolysis infrared spectrometry (PyIR), pyrolysis gas chromatography (PyGC) and energy dispersive X-ray micro probe analysis (EPMA). Whereas the first two methods have been described previously, the microanalytical procedure is new. It may be used in combination with one of the other two techniques for the discrimination between polymer samples.
