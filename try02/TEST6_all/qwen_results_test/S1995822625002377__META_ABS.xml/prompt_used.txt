You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignin in oilfield application: Current trends and future perspectives With the depletion of shallow and mid-depth oil and gas resources, exploration and development have increasingly shifted toward deep and ultra-deep reservoirs. However, high bottom-hole temperatures and pressures, along with complex geological conditions, pose significant challenges. Additionally, growing environmental regulations restrict the use of conventional petroleum-derived chemicals such as polyacrylamide, sulfonic acid resins, and sulfonic acid asphalt. In recent years, lignin has demonstrated significant potential in petroleum exploration and development due to their sustainability, biodegradability, and excellent thermal, chemical, mechanical, and rheological properties. This article reviews the structure, classification, preparation, and modification methods of lignin, followed by a systematic discussion of its applications in oilfield operations. In drilling fluids, lignin and its derivatives serve as rheological regulators, fluid loss control agents, and shale inhibitors, contributing to enhanced cuttings transport and wellbore stability. In fracturing fluids, they function as thickeners and breaker agents, improving fracturing efficiency while protecting the reservoir. In enhanced oil recovery, lignin-based polymers act as surfactants and profile control agents, reducing interfacial tension between water and rock surfaces and increasing the effective permeability of sandstone reservoirs. Furthermore, in oilfield wastewater treatment, lignin-based materials effectively remove oil-water mixtures, heavy metal cations, and solid particles through filtration, adsorption, and flocculation.
