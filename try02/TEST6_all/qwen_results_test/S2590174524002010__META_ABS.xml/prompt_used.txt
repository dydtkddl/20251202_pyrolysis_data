You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive thermal properties, kinetic, and thermodynamic analyses of biomass wastes pyrolysis via TGA and Coats-Redfern methodologies This study comprehensively analyzes the thermal decomposition characteristics as well as the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of five biomass wastes, including coffee husk, groundnut shell, macadamia nutshell, rice husk, and tea waste, using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and the Coats-Redfern method. The TGA experiments were conducted on a PerkinElmer STA 6000 instrument under an inert N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 20 °C/min, spanning a temperature range from 25 °C to 950 °C. The results identified three distinct pyrolysis stages: drying, devolatilization, and char formation, with macadamia nutshell demonstrating the highest thermal reactivity and efficient devolatilization characteristics, reflected by its lowest initial devolatilization temperature (175 °C) and highest peak temperature (380 °C). Kinetic analysis revealed that coffee husk had the highest overall activation energy (E a ) of 60.59 kJ/mol, indicating complex thermal degradation behavior. The thermodynamic evaluation showed that coffee husk also exhibited the highest enthalpy change (ΔH=55.46 kJ/mol) but the lowest Gibbs free energy change (ΔG=148.34 kJ/mol), suggesting high energy requirements for decomposition but relatively more spontaneous reactions compared to other biomass types. Macadamia nutshell demonstrated high ΔG (163.24 kJ/mol) and moderate ΔH (32.44 kJ/mol), reflecting greater resistance to spontaneous decomposition. The comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) and devolatilization index (Ddev ) confirmed macadamia nutshell as the most reactive biomass, while rice husk exhibited the lowest reactivity. The findings highlight the importance of multi-step kinetic analysis for accurately understanding pyrolysis processes, providing critical insights for optimizing biomass conversion for energy production. Future research should explore co-pyrolysis with varied biomass mixtures and advanced kinetic modeling to enhance energy yields.
