Infrared and thermogravimetric studies of thermal degradation of polystyrene in the presence of ammonium sulfate Thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of polystyrene (PS), in the presence of ammonium sulfate, was studied with thermogravimetry (TG) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Thermogravimetry results indicated that ammonium sulfate accelerated thermal degradation in nitrogen but delayed thermo-oxidative degradation of PS in air. IR analysis of tetrahydrofuran extracts, from the samples degraded at 340°C, and of residues after thermal treatment at 340°C in a muffle furnance, showed that the acceleration of thermal degradation and the suppression of thermo-oxidative degradation were due to sulfonation and oxidation of ammonium sulfate and its decomposition products, and formation of unsaturated structures in the PS chain.
