You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing nitrate reduction reaction electroactivity of Fe single atom catalyst by modification of Fe nanoclusters and further application in self-powered ammonia synthesis from air Designing cost-effective nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts and exploring a clean and sustainable energy as power to drive this process are of great significance for the sustainability of the nitrogen cycle. Herein, by direct pyrolysis of MOF and g-C3N4, an efficient electrocatalyst with Fe nanoclusters (FeNC) modified Fe single atoms (FeNC/Fe-Nx) was prepared for NO3RR. Characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the FeNC effectively regulates the d-band structure of Fe sites, increasing the electron occupation in dz2 orbital to optimize the bond order (BO) for intermediates, thus lowering the energy barrier of rate-determining step (RDS: NHO⁎ + H+ + e− → N⁎ + H2O). Therefore, the FeNC/Fe-Nx exhibits remarkable NO3RR performance with a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.6 % at −0.9 V vs. RHE and an excellent NH3 yield rate of 30.87 mg h−1 mgcat −1 at −1.1 V vs. RHE. Based on these, an updated triboelectric nanogenerator-based self-powered NH3 synthesis system was presented, and a high rate of 22.66 μg h−1 was achieved directly using air as the raw material. This work provides a simple strategy to enhance NO3RR performance of Fe-Nx electrocatalysts, and further demonstrates a smart and sustainable way for NH3 synthesis.
