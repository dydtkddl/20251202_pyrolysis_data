Enhancing nitrate reduction reaction electroactivity of Fe single atom catalyst by modification of Fe nanoclusters and further application in self-powered ammonia synthesis from air Designing cost-effective nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts and exploring a clean and sustainable energy as power to drive this process are of great significance for the sustainability of the nitrogen cycle. Herein, by direct pyrolysis of MOF and g-C3N4, an efficient electrocatalyst with Fe nanoclusters (FeNC) modified Fe single atoms (FeNC/Fe-Nx) was prepared for NO3RR. Characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the FeNC effectively regulates the d-band structure of Fe sites, increasing the electron occupation in dz2 orbital to optimize the bond order (BO) for intermediates, thus lowering the energy barrier of rate-determining step (RDS: NHO⁎ + H+ + e− → N⁎ + H2O). Therefore, the FeNC/Fe-Nx exhibits remarkable NO3RR performance with a high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.6 % at −0.9 V vs. RHE and an excellent NH3 yield rate of 30.87 mg h−1 mgcat −1 at −1.1 V vs. RHE. Based on these, an updated triboelectric nanogenerator-based self-powered NH3 synthesis system was presented, and a high rate of 22.66 μg h−1 was achieved directly using air as the raw material. This work provides a simple strategy to enhance NO3RR performance of Fe-Nx electrocatalysts, and further demonstrates a smart and sustainable way for NH3 synthesis.
