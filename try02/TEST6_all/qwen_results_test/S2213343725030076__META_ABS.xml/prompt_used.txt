You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to aromatic-rich oils: Insights into Fe-modified zeolites regeneration characteristics and iron species evolution Catalytic pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) into building-block chemicals is an important potential strategy for a maximum value of municipal solid waste (MSW). Here, the catalytic conversion of RDF to aromatic-rich oils via Fe-modified zeolites to achieve higher selectivity for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) was reported. The results showed that the use of hierarchical zeolite as carrier could obtain better performance, and the relative content of MAHs could reach 64.16 % at 3-Fe-0.1 M. The regeneration characteristics of 3-Fe-0.1 M were further investigated. It was not found to be deactivated in multi-regeneration experiments, whereas the evolution of the loaded iron species in the regeneration had an impact on the product distribution. The reduction process of iron oxide induced by H2 from the reactants can synergistically enhance the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) content in the oil. High H2 content is detrimental to Fe-modified zeolites for catalyzing the conversion of RDF to aromatic-rich oils because Fe3O4 formation limited the degradation of polyolefins. This study lays the foundation for the development of high-value utilization of RDF.
