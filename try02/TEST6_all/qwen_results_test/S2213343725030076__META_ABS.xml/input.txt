Catalytic pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to aromatic-rich oils: Insights into Fe-modified zeolites regeneration characteristics and iron species evolution Catalytic pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) into building-block chemicals is an important potential strategy for a maximum value of municipal solid waste (MSW). Here, the catalytic conversion of RDF to aromatic-rich oils via Fe-modified zeolites to achieve higher selectivity for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) was reported. The results showed that the use of hierarchical zeolite as carrier could obtain better performance, and the relative content of MAHs could reach 64.16 % at 3-Fe-0.1 M. The regeneration characteristics of 3-Fe-0.1 M were further investigated. It was not found to be deactivated in multi-regeneration experiments, whereas the evolution of the loaded iron species in the regeneration had an impact on the product distribution. The reduction process of iron oxide induced by H2 from the reactants can synergistically enhance the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) content in the oil. High H2 content is detrimental to Fe-modified zeolites for catalyzing the conversion of RDF to aromatic-rich oils because Fe3O4 formation limited the degradation of polyolefins. This study lays the foundation for the development of high-value utilization of RDF.
