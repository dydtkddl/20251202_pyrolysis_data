You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive characterization of sustainably synthesized lignin-based polyols towards thermoset materials Lignin, the most abundant aromatic biopolymer, has a high potential as an alternative to fossil resources in the chemical industry, especially within thermoset materials not only as a filler material but as reactant contributing to product properties. However, incorporating lignin is challenging because of the low and non-uniform reactivity of the functional groups and lack of characterization understanding. This study evaluated both ethylene carbonate and glycerol carbonate to obtain a polyol with solely aliphatic OH functionalities by modifying four different organosolv lignins from beech and poplar. The modification with ethylene carbonate yielded a polyol with aliphatic OH content in agreement with the theoretically calculated aliphatic OH content by conversion of native aliphatic and phenolic OH functionalities and COOH moieties. The modification with glycerol carbonate resulted in a more complex product with a lower aliphatic OH content than expected. This bias is caused by (1) non-reactivity of native alOH moieties with glycerol carbonate and (2) the formation of cyclic CO3 moieties on top of lignin. The hypothesis regarding loss of low molecular weight fragments in the work up was refuted. In addition to 31P NMR as a widely used analysis, 13C NMR was applied throughout the study and was successfully used in the aliphatic OH content determination in OL feedstocks as well as contributing to glycerol carbonate modified lignin with direct quantification of the 1,2-diol content and cyclic CO3 content. The uniform and improved reactivity towards thermoset development was demonstrated by an esterification with propionic acid as a proof-of-concept for e.g. polyester development
