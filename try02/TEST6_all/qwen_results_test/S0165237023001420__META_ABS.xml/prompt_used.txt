You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam cracking of methyl ester: A modeling study on the influence of the hydrocarbon backbone Biodiesel can be used to produce clean platform chemicals for the chemical industry, as an alternative to or blend with conventional steam cracking feedstocks. Research on the decomposition chemistry of biodiesel is crucial for understanding their combustion, aging and potential as source for base chemical production. Three methyl esters are studied with varying hydrocarbon chain length and a different degrees of saturation to evaluate the impact of these structural differences on the decomposition chemistry and the decomposition product composition. A new kinetic model is developed with the automatic kinetic model generation tool Genesys for the pyrolysis of methyl butanoate, methyl decanoate and methyl dec-4-enoate. New ab initio calculations are carried out for the pyrolysis of methyl butanoate and for retro-ene reactions in unsaturated hydrocarbons and methyl esters, because of their importance in the secondary decomposition chemistry. The first-principles based kinetic model is validated using in-house experimental data gathered in a tubular reactor and against literature experimental data gathered in a jet-stirred reactor for methyl decanoate pyrolysis. A rate of production analysis reveals the main channels towards the pyrolysis products. The presence of the double bond in the hydrocarbon chain leads to a higher production of aromatic species, at the cost of a lower ethylene and propylene production. The high selectivity to aromatics is caused by the fast formation of 1,3-cyclopentadiene from the unsaturated, resonantly stabilized radicals formed during the decomposition.
