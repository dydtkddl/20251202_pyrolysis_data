Applications and immobilization strategies of the copper-centred laccase enzyme; a review Laccase is a multi-copper enzyme widely expressed in fungi, higher plants, and bacteria which facilitates the direct reduction of molecular oxygen to water (without hydrogen peroxide production) accompanied by the oxidation of an electron donor. Laccase has attracted attention in biotechnological applications due to its non-specificity and use of molecular oxygen as secondary substrate. This review discusses different applications of laccase in various sectors of food, paper and pulp, waste water treatment, pharmaceuticals, sensors, and fuel cells. Despite the many advantages of laccase, challenges such as high cost due to its non-reusability, instability in harsh environmental conditions, and proteolysis are often encountered in its application. One of the approaches used to minimize these challenges is immobilization. The various methods used to immobilize laccase and the different supports used are further extensively discussed in this review.
