You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Trinity effect of potassium sulfonate-benzimidozale towards self-intumescent flame-retarded polyester with low fire hazards Additive-type Intumescent flame retardants (IFRs) are widely used in many polymeric materials to reduce fire hazards. However, the migration behavior of IFRs in the long-term use process leads to poor flame retardance durability and undesirable health issue. To address these problems, a novel reactive monomer (MS-K) containing potassium sulfonate and benzimidozale groups was synthesized and chemically linked into the backbones of model polymer (Polyethylene terephthalate, PET). When the PET-copolymer burnt, the sulfonate group worked as acid and gas sources, and the benzimidozale group acted as carbon source. The trinity effect (acid, gas and carbon sources) of benzimidozale-potassium sulfonate structure gave rise to the self-intumescent carbonization behavior of PET matrix. As a result, the formed intumescent char-layer exerted a significant condensed-phase flame retardant effect that can hinder the oxygen exchange, isolate from the heat source and suppress the volatilization of combustible small molecules. Thus, the corresponding PET-copolymer exhibited extremely low fire hazards with UL-94 V-0 rating, a high limiting oxygen index of 32.5 vol%, greatly decreased peak heat release rate (decreased by 58%) and total smoke production (decreased by 39%). The strategy of reactive trinity-macromolecule not only exhibits excellent intumescent flame-retardant effect, but also completely eliminates the migration issue, which represents a promising way to replace the traditional additive-type IFRs.
