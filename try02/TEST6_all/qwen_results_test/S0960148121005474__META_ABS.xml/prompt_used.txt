You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the pyrolysis behaviors of mixed waste plastics Pyrolysis is considered as a promising technology to recover valuable hydrocarbons from waste streams. Even though some studies exist on waste plastics pyrolysis, it still lacks of in-depth knowledge on multiple components plastics pyrolysis. This study explores three types of waste plastics and their mixed forms to obtain thermal cracking features, products distribution, and kinetic features. TG-FTIR was used to observe the decomposition characteristics and functional groups in the volatile fractions of products. The interaction effects of the plastics components during the co-pyrolysis process were compared, analyzed, and reported. For a more precise knowledge of the reaction procedure, a thermodynamic study was conducted. Results showed that TG and DTG curves of PS and PE were similar to each other but different from those of PVC. The main products of PE and PS pyrolysis were alkanes and alkenes, while the major products of PVC pyrolysis were HCl, alkenes, and a small number of aromatic compounds. During the co-pyrolysis process of PS with PVC and PE with PVC, the thermal decomposition rates of PVC were accelerated due to synergistic effect. Implied by the kinetic parameters, pyrolysis of PS, PE, and PVC exhibited one-order reaction from pure component to multiple component mixtures.
