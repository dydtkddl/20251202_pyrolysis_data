Assessment of plastic waste management in Bangladesh: A comprehensive perspective on sorting, production, separation, and recycling The handling of plastic garbage has become a significant environmental and social issue worldwide, including in Bangladesh. This study thoroughly evaluates the methods used in Bangladesh for managing plastic trash, explicitly focusing on sorting, manufacturing, separation, and recycling. The research utilizes qualitative and quantitative methods, such as surveys, interviews, and analysis of existing data, to get insights into the present condition of plastic waste management infrastructure, policies, and practices in Bangladesh. This text examines the difficulties and advantages of categorizing plastic garbage, including the involvement of the informal sector and the absence of organized procedures. In addition, the research examines the manufacturing and consumption habits that contribute to the accumulation of plastic trash, emphasizing the necessity for sustainable alternatives and efforts to raise consumer awareness. The global mismanagement rate is 22%, and the recycling rate for plastic trash is 9%, which is lower. Six hundred forty-six metric tons of plastic waste are collected daily in Bangladesh, yet only 10% of that waste is recycled, and 37.2% needs to be correctly disposed of. Many techniques are utilized to recycle plastic trash worldwide, but Bangladesh wants to recycle 50% of plastic garbage by 2025. Moreover, the research investigates methods for separating plastic waste, highlighting adequate segregation's significance in streamlining recycling procedures. The process assesses current recycling activities and infrastructure, pinpointing any deficiencies and potential opportunities for enhancement. The analysis highlights the importance of improving recycling capability and advocating for circular economy concepts to reduce plastic pollution and prevent resource depletion. In summary, this comprehensive analysis of plastic waste management in Bangladesh provides significant insights for policymakers, industrial players, and civil society participants.
