You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of plastic waste management in Bangladesh: A comprehensive perspective on sorting, production, separation, and recycling The handling of plastic garbage has become a significant environmental and social issue worldwide, including in Bangladesh. This study thoroughly evaluates the methods used in Bangladesh for managing plastic trash, explicitly focusing on sorting, manufacturing, separation, and recycling. The research utilizes qualitative and quantitative methods, such as surveys, interviews, and analysis of existing data, to get insights into the present condition of plastic waste management infrastructure, policies, and practices in Bangladesh. This text examines the difficulties and advantages of categorizing plastic garbage, including the involvement of the informal sector and the absence of organized procedures. In addition, the research examines the manufacturing and consumption habits that contribute to the accumulation of plastic trash, emphasizing the necessity for sustainable alternatives and efforts to raise consumer awareness. The global mismanagement rate is 22%, and the recycling rate for plastic trash is 9%, which is lower. Six hundred forty-six metric tons of plastic waste are collected daily in Bangladesh, yet only 10% of that waste is recycled, and 37.2% needs to be correctly disposed of. Many techniques are utilized to recycle plastic trash worldwide, but Bangladesh wants to recycle 50% of plastic garbage by 2025. Moreover, the research investigates methods for separating plastic waste, highlighting adequate segregation's significance in streamlining recycling procedures. The process assesses current recycling activities and infrastructure, pinpointing any deficiencies and potential opportunities for enhancement. The analysis highlights the importance of improving recycling capability and advocating for circular economy concepts to reduce plastic pollution and prevent resource depletion. In summary, this comprehensive analysis of plastic waste management in Bangladesh provides significant insights for policymakers, industrial players, and civil society participants.
