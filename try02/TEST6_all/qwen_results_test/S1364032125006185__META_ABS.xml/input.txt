Zeolite-based catalysis for plastic waste recycling: Sustainable solutions from laboratory testing to industrial applications The rapid rise in global polyolefin plastic waste, with less than 10 % being recycled, highlights the urgent need for effective and sustainable waste valorization solutions. Among emerging technologies, catalytic pyrolysis using zeolite-based catalysts stands out as a particularly promising solution for converting plastic waste into high-value hydrocarbons and chemical feedstocks. This review presents a comprehensive and critical synthesis of recent advances in zeolite catalyst development for plastic pyrolysis, addressing key physicochemical properties such as acidity, pore architecture, the Si/Al ratio, the crystal framework, and structural modifications. The specific advantages of zeolite-based catalysts, including their tunable acidity, shape selectivity, thermal stability, and ability to enhance aromatization and cracking pathways, are thoroughly analyzed according to their reaction mechanisms, product selectivity, and catalyst longevity. In contrast to other catalyst types, zeolites offer superior control over hydrocarbon distribution, facilitating the production of gasoline-range aromatics and light olefins with high efficiency. In addition to catalyst design, this review explores the influence of reactor configuration, process parameters, and energy integration on performance and environmental sustainability. A unified techno-economic and life cycle assessment (TEA–LCA) framework is introduced to evaluate feasibility and sustainability, addressing critical metrics such as system boundaries, functional units, process costs, and environmental impacts. Furthermore, catalyst deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies are reviewed to ensure long-term catalytic efficiency. By synthesizing multidisciplinary findings, this review identifies pathways for optimizing catalyst function and process integration, supporting the advancement of catalytic pyrolysis as a scalable and coefficient approach to plastic waste valorization and circular economy development.
