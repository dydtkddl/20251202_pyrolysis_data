Recent on-line processing procedures for biological samples for determination of trace elements by atomic spectrometric methods Few of the elements present in nature play a metabolic role in living organisms. According to their abundance, these elements are classified as macro-, micro- or trace elements, representing 93%, 5% and around 1% respectively, of the total body weight. The remaining percentage could be attributed to those elements with unknown biological functions, to others which are present only because of the exposure to polluted environment or to those intentionally introduced into the body for a special treatment. This review summarizes and discusses the most recent publications related to the on-line processing of biological samples for trace element determination using atomic spectrometry-based detectors. Preconcentration/separation procedures based on solid phase or cloud point extractions, electrochemical deposition, microdialysis, as well as chemical vapor generation are the common practice for improving the sensitivity and selectivity of the available atomic spectrometric techniques. The advantages of using isotope dilution mass spectrometry in speciation studies are also emphasized. Digestion or leaching in oxidizing acidic mixtures aided by heat or by ultrasound or microwave radiation, performed off- or on-line, is necessary to previous steps when processing solid biological samples. The most relevant analytical figures of merit such as detection limits, enrichment factors and sample throughput as well as some aspects related to the on-line system configurations and accuracy assessments are critically presented.
