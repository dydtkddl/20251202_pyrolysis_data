You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste to waste treatment: Efficient upcycling of jarosite as a metal source and waste PET as a sustainable linker to synthesize iron-based MOF for wastewater treatment Background A significant excess of waste sludge from the metal industry and plastic waste from discarded bottles creates the need for meaningful disposal and sustainable utilisation. Therefore, a sustainable solution has been considered to treat waste streams of textile and pharmaceuticals. Method An iron-based metal-organic framework (Fe-BDC MOF) is synthesised from metals and organic linkers. The synthesised iron-based MOFs efficiently treated dyes and antibiotics in industrial waste streams. Recently, antibiotic and dye removal from pharmaceutical and textile industry wastewater has been urgent from the viewpoint of human health and sustainable environment development. Another Fe-BDC MOF was prepared using commercially available terephthalic acid (Fe-BDC) for comparative analysis. Finding Developed MOFs were characterised using FTIR, FESEM-EDS, TGA, XRD, XPS, and BET techniques. Additionally, experiments were conducted to assess the adsorption of Norfloxacin (NR) and Methylene blue (MB) dye using developed MOFs. Under optimised conditions [contact time 20 min (NR), 30 min (MB), initial concentration 25 mg/L, temperature 30 °C, dose 0.3 g/L (NR), 1 g/L (MB) and pH (5.5)], according to Langmuir isotherm the developed Fe-BDC MOF shows maximum adsorption capacities of 1123.60 and 256.41 mg/g of NR and MB, respectively. The removal of NR and MB was well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo 2nd order model. The outcomes of the thermodynamic study reveal that adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous. The synthesis of the Fe-BDC MOF with PET-derived BDC presents a promising method for addressing environmental PET waste while facilitating the efficient removal of NR and MB from wastewater.
