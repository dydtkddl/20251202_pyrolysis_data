Waste to waste treatment: Efficient upcycling of jarosite as a metal source and waste PET as a sustainable linker to synthesize iron-based MOF for wastewater treatment Background A significant excess of waste sludge from the metal industry and plastic waste from discarded bottles creates the need for meaningful disposal and sustainable utilisation. Therefore, a sustainable solution has been considered to treat waste streams of textile and pharmaceuticals. Method An iron-based metal-organic framework (Fe-BDC MOF) is synthesised from metals and organic linkers. The synthesised iron-based MOFs efficiently treated dyes and antibiotics in industrial waste streams. Recently, antibiotic and dye removal from pharmaceutical and textile industry wastewater has been urgent from the viewpoint of human health and sustainable environment development. Another Fe-BDC MOF was prepared using commercially available terephthalic acid (Fe-BDC) for comparative analysis. Finding Developed MOFs were characterised using FTIR, FESEM-EDS, TGA, XRD, XPS, and BET techniques. Additionally, experiments were conducted to assess the adsorption of Norfloxacin (NR) and Methylene blue (MB) dye using developed MOFs. Under optimised conditions [contact time 20 min (NR), 30 min (MB), initial concentration 25 mg/L, temperature 30 °C, dose 0.3 g/L (NR), 1 g/L (MB) and pH (5.5)], according to Langmuir isotherm the developed Fe-BDC MOF shows maximum adsorption capacities of 1123.60 and 256.41 mg/g of NR and MB, respectively. The removal of NR and MB was well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo 2nd order model. The outcomes of the thermodynamic study reveal that adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous. The synthesis of the Fe-BDC MOF with PET-derived BDC presents a promising method for addressing environmental PET waste while facilitating the efficient removal of NR and MB from wastewater.
