You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-resolution metal 3D printing via digital light processing Three-dimensional (3D) printing of complex metallic parts with a micrometer resolution can extend the application of additive manufacturing to various fields wherein the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of metals are essential. Digital light processing (DLP) offers high-resolution and scalable 3D printing via vat photopolymerization (VPP). We present a high-precision metal 3D printing method, namely lithography metal additive manufacturing (LMAM) that uses DLP for a photosensitive resin filled with metal powder. The printing process and sintering conditions for a stainless-steel feedstock are discussed. Highly complex and hollow structures with a spatial resolution of 35 μm and surface roughness as low as 1 < Ra < 2 μm can be printed on a decimeter scale without any support structures. The density and tensile strength of the sintered parts are 99.3 % and 93 %, respectively, of those of annealed 316 L steel. The LMAM method is suitable for manufacturing small and highly accurate devices with tailored designs in diverse areas, such as microheat exchangers, biomedical implants, and metamaterials, as well as extends metal 3D printing to chemical engineering for pharmaceutical applications.
