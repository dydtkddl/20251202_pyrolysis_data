Metal-organic frameworks for removing emerging organic pollutants: A review Due to higher porosity and larger specific surface area, metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) have broad application prospects in Emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) removal. In this study, the synthesis and modification of MOFs and their latest research progress in EOPs removal were critically and comprehensively reviewed through literature analysis. Although previous reviews have explained the use of MOFs to remove pollutants from wastewater, this review comprehensively compiles the mechanisms and latest developments of MOFs in removing EOPs. The results showed that MOFs mainly include simple metal-based MOFs with different node metals, MOFs-derived carbon materials, MOF-on-MOF and MOF and COF (Covalent organic framework) with different combinations. Solvothermal is still the most important method to synthesize MOF, but microwave, ultrasonic, electrochemical, and mechanochemical synthesis methods are also promising. In situ generation in MOF's cavities, self-sacrificed template, surface modified encapsulation, step-by-step construction of heterostructure and one-pot modification methods are five main modification methods. MOFs could remove antibiotics, insecticides and dyes by adsorption and catalytic oxidation, in which catalytic oxidation can achieve effective degradation and complete mineralization of EOPs. In the future, the synthesis of MOFs will develop in the direction of mild conditions, low solvents, short time and high efficiency. MOFs need to have the characteristics of natural degradation and recycling to reduce secondary pollution. This study will provide valuable guidance for the practical design and application of MOFs in EOPs removal.
