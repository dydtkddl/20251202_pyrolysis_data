Sustainable production of bio-based epoxy resins using the phenolics produced via atmospheric ex-situ catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass Replacement of fossil-based chemicals with their bio-based analogues is vital to reduce the fossil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, production of bio-based epoxy resin is important for a sustainable development. The aim of this study was to introduce a potential technique for producing phenolic compounds from biomass followed by a synthesis of bio-based epoxy resin. Hence, atmospheric ex-situ catalytic hydropyrolysis of wood sawdust was performed using a Molybdenum on Aluminum oxide (Mo/Al2O3) catalyst in a continuous drop-tube pyrolyzer for a selective production of phenolic compounds. The phenolics were purified and concentrated by liquid–liquid extraction and used to synthesize bio-based epoxy resin. The results revealed that a mild catalytic hydrotreatment of the pyrolysis vapor using Mo/Al2O3 at 673 K improved the phenolics yield. The organic pyrolysis oil contained up to 41 wt% phenolics whereof 20 wt% were volatile. The properties of the synthesized bio-based diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy resin (pyroEP) was comparable to those of commercial epoxy resin. The glass transition temperature of 426 K and reaction energy of 324 kJ/kg confirmed the successful production of a high-performance, sustainable epoxy resin.
