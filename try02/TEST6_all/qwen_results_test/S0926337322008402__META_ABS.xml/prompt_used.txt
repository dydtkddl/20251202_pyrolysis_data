You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A general strategy and a consolidated mechanism for low-methane hydrogenolysis of polyethylene over ruthenium Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most environment-threatening plastic waste. Its Ru-catalyzed hydrogenolysis is rapid but produces too much methane. Here, low-density PE hydrogenolysis is performed at mild conditions and short times over Ru-doped zirconia catalysts (Ru-XZr, X = Ti, Nb, Ce, W, V, Mo, Fe) to determine low-methane catalysts. Methane is produced via direct terminal C-C scission and surface cascade of consecutive C-C scissions, with the latter sensitive to hydrogen availability and dominant in hydrogen-lean conditions. Reactivity studies, characterization and theory reveal that the most effective dopant oxides (W, V, and Mo) are intermediately reducible, as they store and supply extra hydrogen to Ru via reverse hydrogen spillover. This hydrogen readily hydrogenates and desorbs long alkyl surface intermediates that would otherwise produce cascade methane. Our proposed mechanism reconciles the low methane production achieved by increasing the hydrogen pressure or reducing the particle size and exposes the key selectivity descriptors.
