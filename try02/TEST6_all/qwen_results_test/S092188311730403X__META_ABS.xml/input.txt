Co-Al spinel-based nanoparticles synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis for glycerol conversion The catalytic properties of Co-Al spinel nanoparticles prepared by liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (L-F FSP) were investigated in the glycerol conversion in gas phase in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Reduction at 1123 K of the as-synthesized spinel nanoparticles induced the formation a new phase containing metallic cobalt species. Although, the reducibility of cobalt oxides is greatly decreased due to interaction with aluminium species, this strong interaction may prevent the aggregation of Co particles under the harsh reduction conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the reduced spinel nanoparticles at 1123 K revealed that the Co/Al atomic ratio has decreased to Co/Al = 0.11, which may indicate a redistribution of the aluminum and cobalt species at the surface of the sample submitted to the reduction in a flow of hydrogen at 1123 K. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) also reinforced the formation of metallic cobalt species after reduction of cobalt from the spinel nanoparticles at 1123 K. The main products obtained from the conversion of glycerol in the gas phase were hydroxyacetone, pyruvaldehyde, lactic acid and lactide. FSP ensured uniform dispersion of the active metal on a support material.
