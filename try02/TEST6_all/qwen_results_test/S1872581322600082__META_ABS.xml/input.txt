Research of hydrogen action during pre-sulfidation of direct coal liquefaction catalyst A series of iron sulfide catalysts were prepared by pre-sulfidation at different temperatures and different hydrogen partial pressures, and their catalytic naphthalene hydrogenation activities were studied under 5 MPa 1% H2S-H2 atmosphere at 360 °C. By means of XRD, MES, SEM-EDS, ICP and GC-MS, the effect of hydrogen on the pre-sulfidation process at different temperatures is studied. The results show that the introduction of hydrogen during the pre-sulfidation process facilitates the transfer of sulfur, thereby promoting the sulfidation. Different temperatures are favorable for the formation of Fe1–x S, but the effect of hydrogen is different at different pre-sulfidation temperatures. When pre-sulfidation at 50 °C, the introduction of hydrogen can be beneficial to the transfer of sulfur, which increases the catalytic activity, a lot of elemental Fe and elemental S can be observed at this temperature; when pre-sulfidation at 150 °C, the catalytic activity is the best. The content of elemental Fe decreases and no elemental S is observed. With the increase of hydrogen partial pressure, the hydrogenation conversion rate of naphthalene increases from 60.6% to 69.1%. When pre-sulfidation at 300 °C, the catalytic activity decreased to varying degrees. Hydrogen reduces the sulfur on the catalyst surface to a low valence state and crystalline Fe3O4 is observed inside the catalyst particles, which is not conducive to the transfer of sulfur.
