You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research of hydrogen action during pre-sulfidation of direct coal liquefaction catalyst A series of iron sulfide catalysts were prepared by pre-sulfidation at different temperatures and different hydrogen partial pressures, and their catalytic naphthalene hydrogenation activities were studied under 5 MPa 1% H2S-H2 atmosphere at 360 °C. By means of XRD, MES, SEM-EDS, ICP and GC-MS, the effect of hydrogen on the pre-sulfidation process at different temperatures is studied. The results show that the introduction of hydrogen during the pre-sulfidation process facilitates the transfer of sulfur, thereby promoting the sulfidation. Different temperatures are favorable for the formation of Fe1–x S, but the effect of hydrogen is different at different pre-sulfidation temperatures. When pre-sulfidation at 50 °C, the introduction of hydrogen can be beneficial to the transfer of sulfur, which increases the catalytic activity, a lot of elemental Fe and elemental S can be observed at this temperature; when pre-sulfidation at 150 °C, the catalytic activity is the best. The content of elemental Fe decreases and no elemental S is observed. With the increase of hydrogen partial pressure, the hydrogenation conversion rate of naphthalene increases from 60.6% to 69.1%. When pre-sulfidation at 300 °C, the catalytic activity decreased to varying degrees. Hydrogen reduces the sulfur on the catalyst surface to a low valence state and crystalline Fe3O4 is observed inside the catalyst particles, which is not conducive to the transfer of sulfur.
