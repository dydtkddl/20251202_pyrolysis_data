Design of particle bed reactors for the space nuclear thermal propulsion program This paper describes the design for the Particle Bed Reactor (PBR) that we considered for the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) Program. The methods of analysis and their validation are outlined first. Monte Carlo methods were used for the physics analysis, several new algorithms were developed for the fluid dynamics, heat transfer and transient analysis; and commercial codes were used for the stress analysis. We carried out a critical experiment, prototypic of the PBR to validate the reactor physics; blowdown experiments with beds of prototypic dimensions were undertaken to validate the power-extraction capabilities from particle beds. In addition, materials and mechanical design concepts for the fuel elements were experimentally validated. Four PBR rocket reactor designs were investigated parametrically. They varied in power from 400 MW to 2000 MW, depending on the mission's goals. These designs all were characterized by a negative prompt coefficient, due to Doppler feedback, and a moderator feedback coefficient which varied from slightly positive to slightly negative. In all practical designs, we found that the coolant worth was positive, and the thrust/weight ratio was greater than 20.
