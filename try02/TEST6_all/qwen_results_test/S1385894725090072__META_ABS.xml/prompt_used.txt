You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flameless combustion characteristics using representative pyrolysis gas derived from plastic waste via the Hamburg process Flameless combustion effectively reduces nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions and enhances combustion stability. Its ability to support fuel flexibility makes it suitable for application in plastic pyrolysis syngas. Despite extensive research on various gaseous fuels, the application of non-condensable syngas from the pyrolysis of waste plastic in flameless combustion remains unexplored. Here, we explored the use of syngas generated through the Hamburg plastic pyrolysis process at 500–800 °C as a fuel for flameless combustion. Although the gaseous products from pyrolysis varied from hydrogen to C1–C5 hydrocarbons, CH4, C2H4, and C3H8 were predominantly used as representative fuels. The temperature fields, NO emissions, and spatial distribution and intensity of hydroxyl (OH) radicals were analyzed under various combustion conditions to evaluate their interactions. The temperature and NO emission trends for the plastic pyrolysis syngas under flameless combustion conditions were analyzed, and the OH radical distribution was investigated using an intensified charge-coupled device camera. The results revealed a strong correlation between OH radical concentration and NO emissions, though this correlation did not always align with peak temperature regions. Furthermore, reducing the equivalence ratio and oxygen fraction effectively expanded the reaction zone, suppressed OH radical intensity, and mitigated NO formation. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for optimizing flameless combustion systems in alternative fuel applications, enhancing both emission reduction and fuel flexibility in industrial combustion technologies.
