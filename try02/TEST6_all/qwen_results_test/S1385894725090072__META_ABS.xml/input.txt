Flameless combustion characteristics using representative pyrolysis gas derived from plastic waste via the Hamburg process Flameless combustion effectively reduces nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions and enhances combustion stability. Its ability to support fuel flexibility makes it suitable for application in plastic pyrolysis syngas. Despite extensive research on various gaseous fuels, the application of non-condensable syngas from the pyrolysis of waste plastic in flameless combustion remains unexplored. Here, we explored the use of syngas generated through the Hamburg plastic pyrolysis process at 500–800 °C as a fuel for flameless combustion. Although the gaseous products from pyrolysis varied from hydrogen to C1–C5 hydrocarbons, CH4, C2H4, and C3H8 were predominantly used as representative fuels. The temperature fields, NO emissions, and spatial distribution and intensity of hydroxyl (OH) radicals were analyzed under various combustion conditions to evaluate their interactions. The temperature and NO emission trends for the plastic pyrolysis syngas under flameless combustion conditions were analyzed, and the OH radical distribution was investigated using an intensified charge-coupled device camera. The results revealed a strong correlation between OH radical concentration and NO emissions, though this correlation did not always align with peak temperature regions. Furthermore, reducing the equivalence ratio and oxygen fraction effectively expanded the reaction zone, suppressed OH radical intensity, and mitigated NO formation. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for optimizing flameless combustion systems in alternative fuel applications, enhancing both emission reduction and fuel flexibility in industrial combustion technologies.
