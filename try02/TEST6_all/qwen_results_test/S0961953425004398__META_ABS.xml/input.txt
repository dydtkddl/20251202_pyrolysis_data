A comprehensive review of recent innovations in transforming bio-oil into bioplastics for sustainable product development within a circular economy The environmental impact of non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels and petrochemical plastics is increasing and needs a shift towards sustainable materials production. This review focuses on advanced technologies in pyrolysis processes mainly catalytic and co-pyrolysis processes that convert waste streams into valuable products. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis and catalytic improvements are two important advancements that enable better bio-oil properties, the removal of impurities, and scalability. Bio-oil is rich in organic compounds and is an ideal platform for synthesizing biodegradable polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as an environment-friendly replacement for petroleum-derived plastics. Co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic waste has been shown effective in improving bio-oil quality as well as dealing with waste management challenges. Additional utilization of pyrolysis products in bioplastic production is made possible through other chemical transformations, which include ring-opening polymerization and cross-linking. However, despite these advancements, important hurdles remain, including scaling up manufacturing, keeping prices affordable, and maintaining product consistency. These challenges require the interaction of technology advancement, policy implementation, and market adaptation. This review highlights pyrolysis as a crucial process in circular economy models, producing bio-oil that can be converted into sustainable materials like bioplastics, thereby supporting climate change mitigation efforts.
