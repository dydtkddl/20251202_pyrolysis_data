You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of recent innovations in transforming bio-oil into bioplastics for sustainable product development within a circular economy The environmental impact of non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels and petrochemical plastics is increasing and needs a shift towards sustainable materials production. This review focuses on advanced technologies in pyrolysis processes mainly catalytic and co-pyrolysis processes that convert waste streams into valuable products. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis and catalytic improvements are two important advancements that enable better bio-oil properties, the removal of impurities, and scalability. Bio-oil is rich in organic compounds and is an ideal platform for synthesizing biodegradable polymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as an environment-friendly replacement for petroleum-derived plastics. Co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic waste has been shown effective in improving bio-oil quality as well as dealing with waste management challenges. Additional utilization of pyrolysis products in bioplastic production is made possible through other chemical transformations, which include ring-opening polymerization and cross-linking. However, despite these advancements, important hurdles remain, including scaling up manufacturing, keeping prices affordable, and maintaining product consistency. These challenges require the interaction of technology advancement, policy implementation, and market adaptation. This review highlights pyrolysis as a crucial process in circular economy models, producing bio-oil that can be converted into sustainable materials like bioplastics, thereby supporting climate change mitigation efforts.
