A review of Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling of dry reforming of methane for improved catalyst and reactor design Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool for modeling chemical reactors. While limited literature is available on CFD simulation of Methane Dry Reforming (DRM), this reaction presents several environmental and economic advantages. Modeling DRM using CFD can provide insights for optimizing chemical reactors, evaluating catalysts interactions with surrounding reactive flow, improving properties of catalysts that are not yet well developed and determining optimum operating conditions for high process efficiency. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in CFD modeling of DRM. After a brief description of the reaction thermodynamics, the kinetic models applied in CFD simulation for DRM and their limitations are covered along with an analysis of the governing equations employed. The review also tackles various catalysts and types of reactors employed for DRM simulation. It then identifies remaining challenges and potential research directions for more efficient hydrogen and syngas production using DRM.
