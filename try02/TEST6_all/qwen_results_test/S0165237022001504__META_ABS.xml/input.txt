Kinetics and behavior analysis of lobster shell pyrolysis by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS The pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of lobster shells (LoS) were investigated using TGA, a fixed-bed reactor, and Py-GC/MS. The pyrolysis of LoS can be divided into three stages. Even II (200–600 ℃) and Even III (600–900 ℃) were responsible for devolatilization. The pyrolysis in Even II and Even III had an activation energy of 192.3 kJ/mol and 178.5 kJ/mol, respectively, with mechanism functions of nth-order reaction f(α) = (1-α)4.74 and contracting cylinder f(α) = 2(1-α)1/2 models, respectively. The LoS pyrolysis was suitable for bio-oil preparation with approximately 32.5–47.1 wt%. The gasoline potential of bio-oil can be enhanced by increasing the pyrolytic temperature. Owing to the complexity of the mechanism, pyrolytic kinetics were investigated using the IPR model. According to the results of the IPR model, the pyrolysis of Even II accounted for the degradation of organic matter and calcium oxalate. The pyrolysis of Even III was attributed to the decomposition of CaCO3.
