Municipal solid waste (MSW) pyrolysis for bio-fuel production: A review of effects of MSW components and catalysts With the realization of fossil fuels depletion, research has been started on the alternate energy sources. Biomass is a renewable energy source, from which bio-fuels can been produced. These bio-fuels are then used for power generation. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a type of biomass which has been widely used in the production of bio-fuels. Since 1900s, studies have shown that a lot of research has been done in determining the optimum processes for producing bio-fuel through MSW. Pyrolysis is one of these processes. This process roots out various drawbacks which are present in other processes. It produces high grade pyrolysis fuel and reduces production cost. This review paper focuses on pyrolysis of MSW by using its components as a feedstock material with varying composition. The effects of interaction between different components of MSW and their heating values has been reviewed. The heating values are then compared with conventional fuels to highlight the significance of MSW pyrolysis products. The case of catalytic pyrolysis has also been reviewed and the corresponding heating values are compared to obtain high quality fuel. Moreover, a comparison has been made that how pyrolysis is an efficient process as compared to other processes.
