You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gas exfoliation induced N, S-doped porous 2D carbon nanosheets for effective removal of copper ions by capacitive deionization Using capacitive deionization to remove heavy metal ions from water has received much attention, but the inferior salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of electrode materials has always limited its practical application. Herein, N, S co-doped two-dimensional (2D) porous glucose derived carbon nanosheets (NSPGC) was successfully fabricated, utilizing the gas exfoliation by calcination of thiourea. The NSPGC demonstrates distinct 2D lamellas, high specific surface area (2529 m2 g−1), hierarchical pore structure and high wettability. In electrochemical tests, a high specific capacitance (127 F g−1) and electrons/ions transport performance can be achieved in the NSPGC, moreover it showed a prominent SAC of 206.57 mg g−1 and recoverability in 100 mg L−1 CuSO4 solution. Moreover, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation manifested the intrinsic affinity of Cu2+ improved by N, S co-doping, which played an essential role in enhancing the Cu2+ removal performance of CDI. Our work provided a new insight into the preparation of high-performance CDI electrode materials for Cu2+ removal and promoted the application of CDI in heavy metal wastewater.
