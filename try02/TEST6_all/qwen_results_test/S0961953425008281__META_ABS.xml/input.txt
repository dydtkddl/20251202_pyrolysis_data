Recent developments in separation and storage of lignocellulosic biomass-derived liquid and gaseous biofuels: A comprehensive review The global availability of nearly 200 billion tonnes of lignocellulosic biomass has intensified the pursuit of advanced separation, purification, and storage technologies to enhance the quality, yield, and accessibility of sustainable biofuels. The complex composition of biomass hydrolysates, the presence of inhibitory byproducts, and the energy-intensive nature of separation and storage often contributing 40–70 % of total production costs present major challenges for the efficient separation and storage of biomass-derived liquid and gaseous biofuels. Novel approaches to liquid biofuel purification, such as advanced distillation (extractive, azeotropic), membrane separation (nanofiltration, pervaporation), and adsorption (molecular sieves, activated carbon), have shown promise whereas integrated membrane-distillation systems, further, reduce energy consumption by up to 57 % while achieving & > 99.5 % purity in ethanol and butanol. In bioethanol, biobutanol, liquid-liquid extraction, and gas stripping have gained popularity, while pyrolysis oil fractional condensation is used to separate valuable fractions. Advancements in gaseous biofuel purification include pressure swing adsorption for biogas upgrading and membrane technologies for CO2 and H2S removal. Emerging technologies like ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents offer potential for energy-efficient, selective separation, while cryogenic storage at −253 °C and pressures up to 700 bar, along with hybrid storage systems, further improve the safety and stability of gaseous fuels. Process intensification through modular and integrated systems, combined with the use of (Artificial Intelligence) AI for optimization, is reshaping purification workflows. Sustainability assessments highlight the importance of striking a balance between efficiency and environmental impact. This review emphasizes the importance of separation and storage in enabling the commercial viability of lignocellulosic biofuels, as well as providing insights for developing renewable energy systems.
