You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Maximising naphtha-range hydrocarbons from thermal pyrolysis of polyolefin-rich mixed plastic waste by split-plot response surface methodology The pyrolysis of polyolefin (PO)-rich mixed plastic waste represents a promising pathway for recycling plastic waste into liquid hydrocarbons, particularly in the naphtha range, for use as a refinery input. However, assessments of naphtha production from complex plastic waste remain limited. This work systematically investigates the batch pyrolysis of a PO-rich mixed plastic waste derived from a sorted household waste stream (DKR-350) using Design of Experiments (DoE) and response surface methodology (RSM). Oil yield, naphtha-range hydrocarbon yield, and other responses were modelled as functions of relevant processing parameters, such as batch time, temperature, and plastic pre-treatment method. Experiments were conducted in a batch autoclave under various process conditions (380–450 °C, 0–4 h, with varying feedstock pre-treatments, gas types, and pressures). Time and temperature were the most critical factors for achieving the highest oil yield (73% at 420 °C and a batch time of 2.6 h). The highest naphtha yield in the experimental design range was 42% (448 °C, 3.1 h), achieved using a feedstock that had been pre-treated by dry-washing. Additionally, this work gives key insights into the pyrolysis mechanism of plastic waste. For instance, the formation of CO and CO2 was linked to the presence of specific biogenic and non-polyolefinic impurities at various stages during pyrolysis. The composition of the naphtha fraction also becomes increasingly richer in C5-C9 as pyrolysis severity increases. This work explores the potential of pyrolysis as part of the solution to global plastic waste challenges within a more circular economy.
