Innovative transformation of palm oil biomass waste into sustainable biofuel: Technological breakthroughs and future prospects Palm oil industry generates a lot of waste, including empty fruit bunches (EFB), palm kernel shells (PKS), and palm oil mill effluent (POME), leading to environmental concerns. To become carbon-neutral by 2050, palm oil-producing countries are exploring the technological conversion of palm oil biomass (POB) into biofuels as an option to fossil fuels. This study introduces a novel approach to converting POB waste into sustainable biofuel, leveraging advanced catalytic processes and optimized reaction conditions. The innovative techniques achieve a conversion efficiency of over 85 %, substantially higher than existing method, while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60 %. This dual impact on efficiency and environmental benefit underscores the transformative potential of our work. Moreover, our process utilizes 90 % of POB waste, addressing waste management challenges. These breakthroughs position our research as a pivotal contribution to sustainable energy solutions and circular economy practices. Gasification of EFB and PKS generates high-quality syngas, which can be further processed into hydrogen fuel. Integrated biorefineries, combining two or more conversion methods, enhance overall efficiency, reduce management costs, and promote sustainability. The biorefineries can be optimized by integrating renewable resources such as solar energy, co-utilizing POBs, and synergizing with existing palm oil mill infrastructure. This integration supports the transition to a circular economy, achieving zero waste and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, POB commercialization has challenges such as optimized conditions for maximum yield, high cost, gas leakage, and social conflicts. The LCA of POB-based biofuels showed a reduction in EI compared to fossil fuels through anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis. Overall, this paper concludes with policy recommendations and regulatory frameworks essential to advance the commercialization of POB-based biofuels, highlighting the need for continued research and development to establish valorization systems.
