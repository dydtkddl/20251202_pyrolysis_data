Fe/Ce-Dol and La-ZSM-5 dual catalytic cracking of pine wood to prepare light aromatic hydrocarbons ZSM-5 exhibits exceptional catalytic selectivity and deoxygenation activity, making it highly effective for producing light aromatics via biomass pyrolysis. In contrast, dolomite catalysts efficiently crack tar and reduce molecular size, thereby overcoming the limitations of ZSM-5 when processing bulky intermediates. This study applied metal-modified dolomite and ZSM-5 as a dual-catalyst system to enhance the yield and quality of bio-oils. It further investigated staged pyrolysis mechanisms arising from different combinations of mesoporous (dolomite) and microporous (ZSM-5) catalysts. Experiments were performed on a custom-designed dual-stage pyrolysis platform to produce light aromatics from pine wood, and the performance of the individual catalysts was compared with that of the dual-catalyst system. Among the single catalysts, ZSM-5 provided the highest light aromatic yield (28.6 %) followed by La/ZSM-5 (23.19 %). In contrast, dolomite-based catalysts Ce/Dol (15.79 %) and Fe/Dol (10.96 %) produced significantly lower yields. The dual-catalyst configuration substantially enhanced both the concentration and quality of light aromatics. Notably, the Fe/Dol–La/ZSM-5 combination achieved the maximum yield (40.49 %), surpassing the sum of their individual contributions while simultaneously reducing oxygenated compounds to 22.96 % and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to 0.72 %. These results demonstrate that the Fe/Dol–La/ZSM-5 dual-catalyst system is highly effective for enhancing aromatic production and generating high-quality bio-oil.
