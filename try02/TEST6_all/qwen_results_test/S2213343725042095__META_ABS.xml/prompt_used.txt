You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fe/Ce-Dol and La-ZSM-5 dual catalytic cracking of pine wood to prepare light aromatic hydrocarbons ZSM-5 exhibits exceptional catalytic selectivity and deoxygenation activity, making it highly effective for producing light aromatics via biomass pyrolysis. In contrast, dolomite catalysts efficiently crack tar and reduce molecular size, thereby overcoming the limitations of ZSM-5 when processing bulky intermediates. This study applied metal-modified dolomite and ZSM-5 as a dual-catalyst system to enhance the yield and quality of bio-oils. It further investigated staged pyrolysis mechanisms arising from different combinations of mesoporous (dolomite) and microporous (ZSM-5) catalysts. Experiments were performed on a custom-designed dual-stage pyrolysis platform to produce light aromatics from pine wood, and the performance of the individual catalysts was compared with that of the dual-catalyst system. Among the single catalysts, ZSM-5 provided the highest light aromatic yield (28.6 %) followed by La/ZSM-5 (23.19 %). In contrast, dolomite-based catalysts Ce/Dol (15.79 %) and Fe/Dol (10.96 %) produced significantly lower yields. The dual-catalyst configuration substantially enhanced both the concentration and quality of light aromatics. Notably, the Fe/Dol–La/ZSM-5 combination achieved the maximum yield (40.49 %), surpassing the sum of their individual contributions while simultaneously reducing oxygenated compounds to 22.96 % and heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to 0.72 %. These results demonstrate that the Fe/Dol–La/ZSM-5 dual-catalyst system is highly effective for enhancing aromatic production and generating high-quality bio-oil.
