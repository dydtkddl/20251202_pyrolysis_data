You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-triggered low temperature thermal reduction of Zr-modified high entropy oxides with extraordinary thermochemical H2 production performance Solar-driven two-step thermochemical H2O splitting has emerged as a promising strategy for hydrogen production, but the conversion efficiency of solar-to-fuel has to be improved to make it more economically viable. Here, we present insights on microwave-triggered low temperature (600 °C) oxygen exchange for water splitting based on using Zr-modified high entropy oxides. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, BET and EIS. The characterization results showed that the introduction of Zr4+ enlarged the Metal-Oxygen bond length of the spinel phase of FeMgCoNiOx and produced more oxygen vacancies with the increase of Zr4+ concentration, which greatly improved the thermochemical performance of FeMgCoNiOx. Water was splitted via reaction with FeMgCoNiOx/Zry that was previously reduced by microwave irradiation. By tuning the level of Zr4+ content from 0.0 to 1.0, FeMgCoNiOx/Zr0.6 was found to show the best trade-off, giving rise to a H2 yield of 4.84 mmol/g that was two times higher than that of FeMgCoNiOx (2.35 mmol/g) and outstanding thermodynamic energy efficiency (50 %). This work demonstrates that designing materials with abundant oxygen vacancies is a very efficient strategy to improve their thermochemical H2 evolution activity. Moreover, the energy efficiency will be further improved through tighter control of microwave reduction energetics.
