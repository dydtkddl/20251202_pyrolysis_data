You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of recent advances in HTGR CFD and thermal fluid analysis The High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) is an advanced reactor design being pursued by several different domestic and international organizations due to its high outlet temperature and inherent safety features. This paper spotlights some of the recent advances in experimental thermal fluid behavior and safety studies for the HTGR designs. Core heat transfer, plenum flow, and transient event sequence phenomena, or potential accident phenomena, are principally discussed here. Most of these advances arise from the increasing application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to fluid behavior in the reactor vessel under normal and transient conditions. With advanced modeling, some novel design improvements could reduce or eliminate potentially undesirable phenomena such as ‘hot streaking’ and vessel heat up in excess of their design limits. For air ingress accident purposes, CFD simulations are necessary to predict time scales and gas concentration fractions in the vessel. These modeling advances, however, suggest the need for additional experimental validation. Still somewhat lacking, however, are analyses that tie recent vessel and reactor cavity experimental flow results to expected HTGR operation, which is necessary to validate Loss of Forced Circulation (LOFC) type events. Modeling and simulation of these events have the potential to illustrate the hallmark safety feature of the HTGR, which is indefinite or near-indefinite safe-shutdown without any operator intervention or electrical power. Future experiments should then estimate or measure core heat transfer effects to show that fuel design limits are met over the entire length of the accident. The corresponding results could validate the various industry thermal fluid and systems analysis tools for HTGRs.
