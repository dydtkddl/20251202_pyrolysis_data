You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combustion and co-combustion of biochar: Combustion performance and pollutant emissions Biomass is a renewable and clean energy source, offering the potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions when it is used as a biofuel. However, the disadvantages of raw biomass such as poor grindability, high moisture content, and low calorific value hinder its widespread industrial combustion. Thermochemical conversion techniques are widely used to convert biomass to biochar, which serves not only as an adsorbent and soil amendment but also as solid fuels alternative to fossil energy. The upgraded biochar exhibits better physicochemical properties and improved combustion performance. This paper focuses on the properties and combustion behavior of biochar as a solid fuel, reviewing common production techniques of biochar and their effects on yields and properties of biochar. It also examines the combustion characteristics and kinetics of biochar in single- and co-combustion scenarios with other fuels, such as coal, sludge, and petroleum coke, analyzing the influencing factors of combustion behavior and kinetic parameters. This study further investigates the emission characteristics during the combustion of biochar, including gaseous pollutants (such as CO, NOx, SOx, and HCl), ash-related issues, and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Additionally, a new fuel type named “bioslurry”, which is developed with biochar as a main material, is introduced. Furthermore, this paper discusses the techno-economic and environmental aspects of biochar application, exploring the feasibility of its industrial production and utilization.
