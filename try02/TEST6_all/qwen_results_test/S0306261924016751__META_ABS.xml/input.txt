Combustion and co-combustion of biochar: Combustion performance and pollutant emissions Biomass is a renewable and clean energy source, offering the potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions when it is used as a biofuel. However, the disadvantages of raw biomass such as poor grindability, high moisture content, and low calorific value hinder its widespread industrial combustion. Thermochemical conversion techniques are widely used to convert biomass to biochar, which serves not only as an adsorbent and soil amendment but also as solid fuels alternative to fossil energy. The upgraded biochar exhibits better physicochemical properties and improved combustion performance. This paper focuses on the properties and combustion behavior of biochar as a solid fuel, reviewing common production techniques of biochar and their effects on yields and properties of biochar. It also examines the combustion characteristics and kinetics of biochar in single- and co-combustion scenarios with other fuels, such as coal, sludge, and petroleum coke, analyzing the influencing factors of combustion behavior and kinetic parameters. This study further investigates the emission characteristics during the combustion of biochar, including gaseous pollutants (such as CO, NOx, SOx, and HCl), ash-related issues, and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Additionally, a new fuel type named “bioslurry”, which is developed with biochar as a main material, is introduced. Furthermore, this paper discusses the techno-economic and environmental aspects of biochar application, exploring the feasibility of its industrial production and utilization.
