Optimization of high-octane gasoline production from waste plastic via catalytic pyrolysis using nano zeolite: Effects of temperature, catalyst loading, and crystallinity To address the crisis resulting from the unsustainable consumption of oil resources and alleviate global concerns about the accumulation of plastic waste in nature, catalytic pyrolysis has been utilized. Catalytic pyrolysis is a thermochemically efficient capable of converting polymeric wastes into liquid fuel. In this study, the effects of temperature 375–525 °C, catalyst loading percentage in the reactor 2.5–17.5 %, and the crystallinity of the catalyst support 0–100 % on the quality of gasoline produced from the pyrolysis of municipal polymer waste were investigated. XRD, FTIR and BET analysis were utilized to determine the characteristics of the catalyst. Accordingly, nano Cu/Cu2O/CuO@ Y zeolite was utilized as the catalyst in this process. Crystallinity is a parameter that has not been previously examined for its impact on fuel quality. The response surface methodology was employed to optimize the results. The quality of the gasoline produced was assessed by measuring properties such as research octane number, specific gravity, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, flash point, and aniline point. For optimal operating conditions, the octane number of gasoline produced without adding enhancers was equal to 103. Ultimately, it was determined under which operational conditions catalytic pyrolysis can produce sulfur-free gasoline that meets the standards applicable to gasoline used in the transportation industry.
