You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of high-octane gasoline production from waste plastic via catalytic pyrolysis using nano zeolite: Effects of temperature, catalyst loading, and crystallinity To address the crisis resulting from the unsustainable consumption of oil resources and alleviate global concerns about the accumulation of plastic waste in nature, catalytic pyrolysis has been utilized. Catalytic pyrolysis is a thermochemically efficient capable of converting polymeric wastes into liquid fuel. In this study, the effects of temperature 375–525 °C, catalyst loading percentage in the reactor 2.5–17.5 %, and the crystallinity of the catalyst support 0–100 % on the quality of gasoline produced from the pyrolysis of municipal polymer waste were investigated. XRD, FTIR and BET analysis were utilized to determine the characteristics of the catalyst. Accordingly, nano Cu/Cu2O/CuO@ Y zeolite was utilized as the catalyst in this process. Crystallinity is a parameter that has not been previously examined for its impact on fuel quality. The response surface methodology was employed to optimize the results. The quality of the gasoline produced was assessed by measuring properties such as research octane number, specific gravity, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, flash point, and aniline point. For optimal operating conditions, the octane number of gasoline produced without adding enhancers was equal to 103. Ultimately, it was determined under which operational conditions catalytic pyrolysis can produce sulfur-free gasoline that meets the standards applicable to gasoline used in the transportation industry.
