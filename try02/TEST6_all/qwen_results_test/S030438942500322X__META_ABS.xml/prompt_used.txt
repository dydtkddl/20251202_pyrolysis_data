You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exposure to polyethylene terephthalate micro(nano)plastics exacerbates inflammation and fibrosis after myocardial infarction by reprogramming the gut and lung microbiota and metabolome Micro(nano)plastics (MNPs), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, have received increasing attention for their impacts on human health. We conducted an in-depth study on the role of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MNPs in myocardial infarction (MI). Blood from the coronary circulation of MI patients was collected to detect microplastics (MPs). Peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) and AC16 cells were used to assess inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis after PET nanoplastics (NPs) stimulation. The mouse MI model was established after PET NPs respiratory or oral exposure. The results showed that various types of MPs, including high levels of PET MPs, were detected in the coronary circulation. PET NPs promoted inflammatory factors secretion by PBMCs, inhibited AC16 cell proliferation and promoted hypoxia-induced AC16 cell apoptosis. PET NPs exacerbated post-MI inflammation and fibrosis through activating the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Through macrogenetic sequencing and metabolomics analyses, we observed that PET NPs reprogrammed the intestinal and lung microbiota and metabolome in MI mice, leading to chronic inflammation. In conclusion, PET MPs were widely present in the coronary circulation of MI patients. PET MNPs can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway to exacerbate post-MI ventricular remodelling, which may be related to the reprogramming of the gut and lung microbiota and metabolome.
