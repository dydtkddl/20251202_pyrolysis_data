Review: the development and applications of thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation reactions This review outlines the developments of the thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) technique in analytical pyrolysis over the past 12 years. The principal reagent used to effect the thermochemolysis reaction is tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) but the use of other quaternary ammonium hydroxides is discussed. The mechanisms of the reaction and the effect of experimental variables are also incorporated. The wide variety of applications reviewed include synthetic and natural resins, lipids, waxes, wood products, polysaccharides, proteins, soil and humic substances, sediments, kerogen and dyes. On-line and off-line THM reactions are involved.
