Coupling reactions induced by ionic palladium species deposited onto porous support materials This review summarizes recent results reported on the catalytic applications of ionic palladium species deposited onto different types of porous supports, including MCM and SBA materials, periodic mesoporous organosilica materials (PMOs), mesoporous silica (mesoSi) catalysts, zeolites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs), mesoporous carbon samples, organic polymers, and a few other catalyst preparations. Materials obtained through various approaches, including modifications with suitable donor moieties, are described and their structural properties and catalytic performances are discussed. It is demonstrated that the resulting supported PdII catalysts could be successfully used in various C–C and, less frequently, in C–heteroatom coupling and cross-coupling transformations. In most cases, the Heck, Suzuki, and Sonogashira reactions were studied. Discussions contain information on catalyst synthesis, characterization, efficiency, stability, and catalyst reuse. The aim of this review is to highlight current research progress and challenges, and also to inspire further studies in this rapidly developing field.
