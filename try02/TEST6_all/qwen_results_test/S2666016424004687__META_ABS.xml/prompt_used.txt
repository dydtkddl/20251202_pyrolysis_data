You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of liquid fuel production from co-pyrolysis of oil palm fronds and expanded polystyrene using response surface methodology The transformation of plastic and biomass waste into fuel promotes sustainable energy alternatives and efficient waste management. In this study, liquid fuel production from co-pyrolysis of oil palm fronds (PF) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) was experimentally investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The effect of process temperature (T, 300–500 °C), and PF-to-EPS ratio (R, 0.1 to 9) on pyrolysis oil yield (YPO) and PAH's composition (PAHC) was studied using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD). PF-to-EPS ratio (R) was found to be the most significant process parameter for determining the YPO, while T was the most influential process parameter affecting PAHC. The maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 80.11 wt% and minimum PAH composition of 20.63 % area was obtained at an optimum T of 395 °C and 0.1 R. The pyrolysis oil also contained benzene with a concentration below the established standards. The pyrolysis oil produced under optimum conditions had a calorific value of 41.56 MJ/kg, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C of 0.85 mm2/s, density at 15 °C of 0.93 g/cm3, water content of 0.24 wt%, acidity of 3.46 mg KOH/g, and a flash point of 26.05 °C. Pyrolysis oil can potentially improve gasoline's octane rating because of its high aromatic compound content.
