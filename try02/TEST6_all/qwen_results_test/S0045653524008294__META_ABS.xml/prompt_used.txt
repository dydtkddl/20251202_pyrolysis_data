You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the adsorption potential of char derived from waste latex for methylene blue removal This study presents the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) dye using latex char derived from pyrolysis of latex gloves. The adsorption process was investigated systematically using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with a Central Composite Design (CCD). The effects of four key variables, namely pH, time, temperature, and adsorbent dosage, were studied using a factorial design enriched with center points and axial points. Experimental data were analyzed using a second-order polynomial regression model to construct a response surface model, which elucidated the relationship between the variables and MB removal efficiency. The study found that the char obtained at 800 °C exhibited the highest adsorption capacity due to its increased carbonization, expanded surface area, and diverse pore structure. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) confirmed the significance of the quadratic model, with remarkable agreement between predicted and experimental outcomes. Diagnostic plots validated the model's reliability, while 3D contour graphs illustrated the combined effects of variables on MB removal efficiency. Optimization using DoE software identified optimal conditions resulting in a 99% removal efficiency, which closely matched experimental results. Additionally, adsorption isotherms revealed that the Freundlich model best described the adsorption behavior, indicating heterogeneous surface adsorption with multilayer adsorption. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the adsorption process of MB dye using latex char, with implications for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.
