Challenges in particulate polymerization reactor modeling and optimization: A population balance perspective In the present article, recent developments on modeling and optimization of particulate polymerization processes are reviewed. A unified population balance approach is described to follow the time evolution of molecular and morphological polymer properties in batch and continuous polymerization reactors. The numerical methods as well as the computational issues related with the solution of the dynamic population balance equation are critically assessed. The orthogonal collocation on finite elements (OCFE) method and the fixed-pivot technique (FPT) are then applied to a free-radical batch polymerization reactor to calculate the dynamic evolution of the molecular weight distribution (MWD). Moreover, theoretical and experimental results are shown on the dynamic evolution of particle size distribution (PSD) in a suspension polymerization reactor. Recent advances in on-line monitoring of “polymer quality” are briefly discussed in the context of available hardware and software sensors. The problem of real-time optimization of polymerization processes under parametric uncertainty is also examined. Finally, new issues related with the modeling, numerical solution and control of multidimensional population balance equations are conferred.
