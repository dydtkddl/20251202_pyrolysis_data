You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress in MXene-based materials for microwave absorption Due to the rapid development of radar technology, the demand for absorbing stealth materials is increasing, and ultra-broadband absorption (effective absorption bandwidth > 8 GHz) has become an inevitable requirement. As a new type of two-dimensional material, MXene material possesses the characteristics of excellent wave absorbing material due to its easy preparation, easy modulation of defects and surface functional groups, and high conductivity. This work summarizes the absorbing theory and research progress on MXene-based absorbing materials in recent years, including pure MXene absorbing materials and MXene-based magnetic or dielectric composite materials with multiple losses. Some shortcomings and research directions of MXene-based materials were pointed out. Currently, research on MXene-based absorbent materials is thriving and in a state of vigorous development. Excellent absorbent materials have been reported, but their shortcomings are also apparent. The factors that affect the performance of MXene-based absorbent materials are complex, and the absorption mechanism is relatively simple. Further systematic and detailed research is needed to clarify these influencing mechanisms, broaden the absorption bandwidth, and reduce the matching thickness to meet practical usage requirements in the future.
