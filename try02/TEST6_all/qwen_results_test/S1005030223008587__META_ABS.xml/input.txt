Progress in MXene-based materials for microwave absorption Due to the rapid development of radar technology, the demand for absorbing stealth materials is increasing, and ultra-broadband absorption (effective absorption bandwidth > 8 GHz) has become an inevitable requirement. As a new type of two-dimensional material, MXene material possesses the characteristics of excellent wave absorbing material due to its easy preparation, easy modulation of defects and surface functional groups, and high conductivity. This work summarizes the absorbing theory and research progress on MXene-based absorbing materials in recent years, including pure MXene absorbing materials and MXene-based magnetic or dielectric composite materials with multiple losses. Some shortcomings and research directions of MXene-based materials were pointed out. Currently, research on MXene-based absorbent materials is thriving and in a state of vigorous development. Excellent absorbent materials have been reported, but their shortcomings are also apparent. The factors that affect the performance of MXene-based absorbent materials are complex, and the absorption mechanism is relatively simple. Further systematic and detailed research is needed to clarify these influencing mechanisms, broaden the absorption bandwidth, and reduce the matching thickness to meet practical usage requirements in the future.
