You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of conventional and advanced non-destructive testing techniques for detection and characterization of small-scale defects Inspection reliability of small-scale defects, targeting dimensions below 100 µm, is crucial for structural safety of critical components in high-value applications. Early defects are often possible to repair, contributing for the circular economy and sustainability by allowing extended life and reuse of components. During in-service operation, the small-scale defects are typically originated from creep, fatigue, thermal cycles, and environmental damage, or any combination of these multiphysical loading conditions. What are thresholds in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques to detect and reliably characterise small-scale defects? What is the state of the art of NDT-based solutions, in terms of small-scale defects located at surface, and interior of materials? Examples of small-scale defects in engineering materials are established, and a holistic review is composed on the detectability in terms of sensitivity and resolution. Distinguishable high detection accuracy and resolution is provided by computed tomography paired with computer laminography, scanning thermal microscopy paired with Raman spectroscopy, and NDT techniques paired with machine learning and advanced post-processing signal algorithms. Other promising techniques are time-of-flight diffraction, thermoreflectance thermal imaging, advanced eddy currents probes, like the IOnic probe, micro magnetic bridge probe used in magnetic flux leakage, driven-bacterial cells, Quantum dots and hydrogen-as-a-probe.
