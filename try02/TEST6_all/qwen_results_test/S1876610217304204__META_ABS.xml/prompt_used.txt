You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermocatalytic Studies on Municipal Solid Waste The goal of this study was to upgrade the decomposition products of municipal solid waste applying different catalysts during slow and high heating rate pyrolysis. The municipal waste studied was a mixture of biomass and plastics in a ratio of 1:1. Different zeolites (β- and Y-zeolites, ZSM-5 and FCC catalysts) and nickel-molybdenum (NiMo/Al2O3) catalysts were tested in order to upgrade the quality of the decomposition product mixture. The applied sample-catalyst ratio was 2:1. The evolution profiles of the gas phase decomposition products were monitored by thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS). The product distribution was analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) technique. The effect of the catalysts on the biomass part of the waste sample is very similar. The thermal decomposition of the plastic fraction is catalyzed mainly by β-zeolite and ZSM-5, as the thermogravimetric and the mass spectrometric data indicate. The pyrolysis results unambiguously show the cracking effects of the applied catalysts on the composition of the evolving hydrocarbon mixture. The yield of the aromatic products is increased significantly.
