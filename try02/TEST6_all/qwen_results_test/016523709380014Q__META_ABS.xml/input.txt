Experimental study of the quantitative conversion of hexachlorobenzene during high temperature pyrolysis High temperature (1000 and 1100°C), inert atmosphere pyrolysis of hexachlorobenzene with a residence time of 20 s is described. Under these conditions, pyrolysis of hexachlorobenzene leads to the formation of soot, elemental chlorine Cl2 and polychlorinated aromatic compounds, with hexachlorobenzene conversion approaching 70% at 11OO°C. The emphasis is on the qualitative analysis of the soot by means of 13C NMR spectroscopy, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis and electron microscopy. The soot appears to be carbon black containing graphitic structures.
