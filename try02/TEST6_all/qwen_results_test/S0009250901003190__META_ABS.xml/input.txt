Numerical simulation of the gas–particle turbulent flow in riser reactor based on k–ε–k p –ε p –Θ two-fluid model A k–ε–k p –ε p –Θ two-fluid model is established to simulate the gas–article turbulent flow in the riser section of a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor. The model, based on the kinetic theory of granular flow simulates both the gas phase and particle phase by low Reynolds number turbulent model, taking into account the turbulent interaction between gas and particles. The model is coded and solved using a computational fluid dynamic software package CFX4 by AEAT to simulate the two-dimensional, isothermal flow in a riser reactor. The predicted results show satisfactory agreements with experimental data. Moreover, the detailed analysis indicates that the interaction between the turbulence of gas and that of particles is a crucial factor that influences the predicted results.
