You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanisms and mitigation of agglomeration during fluidized bed combustion of biomass: A review A key issue associated with fluidized bed combustion of biomass is agglomeration. The presence of high quantities of alkali metal species in biomass ash leads to the formation of sticky alkali silicate liquid phases during combustion, and consequently the adhesion and agglomeration of bed material. This review examines probable mechanisms of agglomeration and the effects of operational variables in reducing its severity. Additionally, an overview of monitoring and prediction of agglomerate formation is given. Two key mechanisms of agglomeration are apparent in literature, and both may occur concurrently dependending on fuel composition. Coating-induced agglomeration is defined by the interaction of alkali metals in fuel ash with silica in the bed material to form an alkali silicate melt. Melt-induced agglomeration is defined by the presence of sufficient amounts of alkali metals and silica in the fuel ash which together form a eutectic melt. Physical mechanisms, such as tumble agglomeration and sintering, may further enhance either of the coating-induced or melt-induced mechanisms. Of the operational variables examined in this review, temperature, fluidizing gas velocity, fuel, bed material and additives have been shown to have the greatest effect on agglomeration severity. Prediction of agglomeration propensity may be attempted with mathematical correlations or lab-scale fuel testing before use in the boiler, or with in-situ methods, which are typically focused on temperature or pressure analysis. The review of the literature has highlighted the need for further research in several areas, including: mechanisms when using alternate bed materials, use of dual-fuel biomass blends, technical and economic optimisation of the use of alternative bed materials and additives, and further modelling of coating growth behaviours.
