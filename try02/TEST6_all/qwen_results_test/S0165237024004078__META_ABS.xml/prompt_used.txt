You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Methane pyrolysis in molten media: The interplay of physical properties and catalytic activity on carbon and hydrogen production Methane pyrolysis is now considered a promising process for producing clean hydrogen and high-value carbon materials. However, it requires very high temperatures (above 1000 °C) due to the kinetic barriers posed by the stable C-H bond, and the production of carbon presents a significant challenge. While solid catalysts can lower the operational temperatures to some extent, they are hindered by carbon accumulation, which deactivates the catalysts and clogs reactors, thus limiting process scalability. Recently, molten media have emerged as potential catalysts for methane pyrolysis. These media offer numerous advantages, including high thermal conductivity and resistance to deactivation via sintering or coking. Despite these advantages, a comprehensive understanding of how the physical properties and intrinsic catalytic activities of molten media influence methane pyrolysis is lacking. This review addresses this gap by examining the roles of physical properties, mainly surface tension, and catalytic activity in methane conversion and carbon morphology. The analysis of apparent activation energies across various molten media indicates that their physical properties significantly impact methane reactivity, challenging the conventional notion of catalytic activity. In summary, this review explores the synergistic effects of molten media's physical and catalytic properties on methane pyrolysis, highlighting the potential for these systems to revolutionize the process by enhancing efficiency and reducing operational challenges. Understanding these interactions is key to advancing the scalability and applicability of methane pyrolysis technologies for sustainable hydrogen production.
