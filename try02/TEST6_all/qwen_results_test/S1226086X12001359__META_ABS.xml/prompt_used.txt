You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Copper biosorption by pine cone shell and thermal decomposition study of the exhausted biosorbent Pine cone shell (PCS), a vegetable solid waste has been used as effective and efficient biosorbent for the removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. The biosorbent was characterized by elemental analysis, potentiometric titrations, surface area and pore size distribution and FTIR analyses. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out as a function of solution pH, particle size, biosorbent dosage, contact time, and initial metal ion concentration. Then, equilibrium isotherms and kinetic data parameters were evaluated. Equilibrium data agreed well with Langmuir isotherm model. The biosorption capacities of PCS for Cu(II) were determined at 25°C with the Langmuir model as 6.81mg/g. The kinetics data fitted well into the pseudo-second-order model with correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. Also, dynamic biosorption studies were carried out using a packed-bed column and the main column parameters were determined. Pine cone shell was shown to be a promising biosorbent for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solutions. Finally, the pyrolysis characteristics of native PCS and Cu-loaded PCS were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to study the possible recycling of PCS after its use as biosorbent of copper.
