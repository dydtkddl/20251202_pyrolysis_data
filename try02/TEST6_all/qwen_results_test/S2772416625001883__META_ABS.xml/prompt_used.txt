You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bioremediation of microplastic pollution: A systematic review on mechanism, analytical methods, innovations, and omics approaches Microplastic pollution represents an alarming environmental crisis, affecting ecosystems and posing significant threats to biodiversity and human health. This systematic review explores microbial bioremediation as an effective microplastics (MPs) removal approach, focusing on bacterial, fungal, and algal degradation mechanisms. Unlike conventional methods, microbial bioremediation leverages enzymatic activity, biofilm formation, and metabolic pathways to break down MPs into less harmful byproducts. Key influencing factors, such as polymer crystallinity, molecular weight, surface properties, and environmental conditions, play a crucial role in determining microbial degradation efficiency. Analytical methods, including FTIR, SEM, TGA, and gravimetric analysis, provide critical insights into MPs degradation pathways and microbial interactions. Recent innovations, such as bioaugmentation, genetically engineered microbial strains, and enzymatic bioreactors, have further enhanced the efficiency of MPs biodegradation. The integration of omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, has advanced the understanding of microbial metabolic pathways and the identification of novel plastic-degrading enzymes. This review also discusses the specific roles of bacteria, fungi, and algae in MPs degradation, highlighting their enzymatic capabilities and interactions with different polymer types. Despite significant advancements, challenges such as scalability, varying degradation rates across environments, and potential ecological risks remain. Future research should focus on optimizing microbial consortia, improving enzymatic activity, and developing large-scale applications to effectively address MPs pollution.
