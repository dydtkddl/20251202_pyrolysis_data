Bioremediation of microplastic pollution: A systematic review on mechanism, analytical methods, innovations, and omics approaches Microplastic pollution represents an alarming environmental crisis, affecting ecosystems and posing significant threats to biodiversity and human health. This systematic review explores microbial bioremediation as an effective microplastics (MPs) removal approach, focusing on bacterial, fungal, and algal degradation mechanisms. Unlike conventional methods, microbial bioremediation leverages enzymatic activity, biofilm formation, and metabolic pathways to break down MPs into less harmful byproducts. Key influencing factors, such as polymer crystallinity, molecular weight, surface properties, and environmental conditions, play a crucial role in determining microbial degradation efficiency. Analytical methods, including FTIR, SEM, TGA, and gravimetric analysis, provide critical insights into MPs degradation pathways and microbial interactions. Recent innovations, such as bioaugmentation, genetically engineered microbial strains, and enzymatic bioreactors, have further enhanced the efficiency of MPs biodegradation. The integration of omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, has advanced the understanding of microbial metabolic pathways and the identification of novel plastic-degrading enzymes. This review also discusses the specific roles of bacteria, fungi, and algae in MPs degradation, highlighting their enzymatic capabilities and interactions with different polymer types. Despite significant advancements, challenges such as scalability, varying degradation rates across environments, and potential ecological risks remain. Future research should focus on optimizing microbial consortia, improving enzymatic activity, and developing large-scale applications to effectively address MPs pollution.
