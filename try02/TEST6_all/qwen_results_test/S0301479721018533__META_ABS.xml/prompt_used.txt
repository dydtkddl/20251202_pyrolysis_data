You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of pyrolytic non-condensable gases from polypropylene co-polymer into bamboo-type carbon nanotubes and high-quality oil using biochar as catalyst The conversion of low-value plastic waste into high-value products such as carbon nanomaterial is of recent interest. In the current study, the non-condensable pyrolysis gases, produced from Polypropylene Copolymer (PPC) feedstock, was converted into bamboo-type carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) through catalytic chemical vapour deposition using biochar. Experiments were conducted in a three-zone furnace fixed bed reactor, where PPC was pyrolysed in the second zone and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) growth was eventuated in the third zone. The effects of different growth temperatures (500, 700, 900 °C) and biochar particle sizes (nanoparticle as well as 0–100 and 100–300 μm) were investigated to optimise the production of hydrogen and the yield of carbon nanotubes on the biochar surface. Biochar samples used in the synthesis of CNTs were obtained from the pyrolysis of saw dust at 700 °C in a muffle furnace. Analyses performed by using Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy techniques suggested that the best crystalline structure of CNTs were obtained at 900 °C with nano-sized biochar as a catalyst. The strong gas-solid contact and void fraction of nano-sized particles enhances the diffusion–precipitation mechanism, leading to the growth of CNTs. The nano-sized biochar increased hydrogen production at 900 °C and reduced the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content in oil to only 1%, which is advantageous for further utilisation. Therefore, the production of high-value CNTs from waste plastic using low-cost biochar catalyst can be a sustainable approach in the management of waste plastic while participating in the circular economy.
