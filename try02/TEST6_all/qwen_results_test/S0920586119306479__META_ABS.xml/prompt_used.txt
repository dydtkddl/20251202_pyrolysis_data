You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Untangling the role of the organosilane functional groups in the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite by crystallization of silanized protozeolitic units Crystallization of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been performed under hydrothermal conditions from silanized protozeolitic units. The role of amine and phenyl groups present in the organosilanes, as well as the use of dipodal silanization agents, on the creation of mesoporosity in the zeolite samples has been investigated. The presence of amine groups and dipodal moieties in the organosilane increases their interactions with the protozeolitic nanounits in the gel, which results in hierarchical zeolites showing enhanced secondary porosity and a higher degree of modification of the textural properties. Nevertheless, dipodal organosilanes hinder strongly the aggregation of the nanounits, leading to non-completely crystalline materials. In contrast, the combination of phenyl and amine groups into a single organosilane has shown to be effective for the generation of more uniform mesopores. Thus, N-(2-N-Benzylaminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Ph-2A) has been found as the best silanization agent, affording a hierarchical zeolite with a narrow mesopore size distribution and a high concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites. Moreover, during LDPE catalytic cracking in TGA tests, the latter material allowed the conversion of the polymer to occur in a narrow temperature range as a consequence of its more uniform acid and textural properties. Likewise, this sample exhibited a high activity in LDPE cracking at 340 °C using a laboratory scale reaction system to produce mainly gasoline-range hydrocarbons and light olefins.
