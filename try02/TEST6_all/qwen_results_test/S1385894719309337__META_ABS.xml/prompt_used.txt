You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structure and adsorptive property of carbon materials derived from thermal and mechanochemical reaction of CaC2 and chlorinated polymers In this study, calcium carbide-derived carbon materials (CMs) were prepared by reacting CaC2 with chlorinated polymers via mechanochemical (CMs-M) and thermochemical (CMs-T) reaction in a planetary ball mill and tubular reactor, respectively. Their composition, structure, and adsorptive properties for dibenzothiophene (DBT) in oil and Hg2+ in water were studied, and the reaction mechanism was analyzed. In comparison with CMs-T, CMs-M possess higher specific area (600 ± 30 m2·g−1) and rich acetylenic and O-containing functional groups, and accordingly higher adsorptivity. Its saturated adsorbance is as high as 291.2 mg-Hg2+·g−1, and the adsorption isotherm can be well represented by Langmuir model, which manifests the chemisorption arising from the unique interaction between Hg2+ and the functional groups. CMs-M is one of the best carbonaceous sorbents for Hg2+ removal considering its high adsorption rate and capacity, high partition coefficient (21.8 mg·g−1·μM−1 at equilibrium concentration of 0.18 ppm), high selectivity w.r.t other heavy metal ions, and excellent recyclability. The mechanochemical method is more suitable for massive production of CMs in view of its mild operation condition and controllable reaction process. This study also sheds a light on the resource utilization of abundant highly chlorinated polymers, like polyvinylchloride (PVC) and chlorinated PVC (CPVC), for the manufacture of CMs-M.
