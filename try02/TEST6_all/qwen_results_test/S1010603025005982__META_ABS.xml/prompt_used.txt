You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Facile solvent-free synthesis of high-yield carbon quantum dots for hydrogel-mediated fluorescent printing ink The liquid-phase approach is the primary route for producing carbon quantum dots (CQDs), but its complicated purification process and low product yield restrict the large-scale production and application of CQDs. In this work, CQD powder was generated via a facile one-step pyrolysis reaction using glucose and boric acid as precursors without the need for solvents. Notably, the product yield of the CQD powder reaches 76.0 %, exceeding that of most previously reported results. This approach is green and efficient, as it eliminates the need for sophisticated instrumentation, hazardous chemicals, and tedious purification procedures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the surface of the CQDs contains abundant B, O, and other functional groups, which improve their dispersion stability while suppressing the fluorescence quenching induced by particle aggregation. The CQDs show green fluorescence in solid powder and blue-green fluorescence in solution (quantum yield = 15.9 %), both of which exhibit excitation-dependent emission behavior. The synthesized CQD powder exhibits favorable compatibility with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogels, allowing for the formulation of a stable CQD/PVA fluorescent ink. This hydrogel-based ink possesses favorable rheological properties, allowing precise patterning on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates via 3D printing technology. This capability highlights its promising potential for direct ink writing and anti-counterfeiting applications. This work offers a sustainable and effective approach for the large-scale preparation of CQDs, highlighting the high-value utilization of CQDs in creating fluorescent anticounterfeiting inks.
