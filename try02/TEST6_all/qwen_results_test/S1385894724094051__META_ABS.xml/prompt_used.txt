You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of hydrogen production from thermal and catalytic cracking of HDPE through Implementation of activated biochar This study investigated hydrogen production characteristics from thermal and catalytic cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and role of activated biochar derived from biomass (palm kernel shell, PKS). The objective was to enhance hydrogen yield in response to growing demands for hydrogen and the management of waste plastic. Three experimental setups—pyrolysis, thermal cracking, and char cracking—were employed in a two-stage pyrolysis system to examine the impact of reaction temperature and activated biochar on 1) the decomposition of HDPE into tar, which is a complex hydrocarbon mixture, and 2) the production of hydrogen from the vaporized tar. The findings indicated that the reaction temperature in the first reactor influenced tar vapor formation, whereas the temperature in the second reactor was more closely associated with the production of hydrogen and lighter hydrocarbons such as methane. Under identical temperature conditions, the use of activated biochar increased the hydrogen production by more than six times and adsorbed the solid carbon, resulting in no visible carbon particles. Although the reaction temperatures in this study were higher than those in previous studies involving other catalysts, leading to increased energy costs, the abundant biomass sources for carbon activation and the simplicity of the manufacturing process could position activated biochar as a viable catalyst for the thermochemical recycling of plastic into energy source.
