You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective depolymerization of polyethylene plastic wastes under hydrothermal and solvothermal liquefaction conditions Depolymerization of polyethylene (PE) is one of the most challenging tasks in the chemical upcycling of PE-based plastic wastes because the disassociation of the stable carbon–carbon bonds in PE is only possible at a very high reaction temperature. The thermal liquefaction of PE cable plastic waste in a stainless-steel batch reactor was thoroughly evaluated in this study. The effect of different liquefaction methods (hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), ionic liquids catalyzed HTL, and solvothermal liquefaction (STL)) on the yields of product fractions (oil products, solid residue, and gas) and the properties of the oil products were examined. At 350 °C and 90 min reaction duration, the conversion (%) of 75.43%, the oil yield of 39.33%, the energy recovery rate of 39.7%, the higher heating values (HHV) of 43.83 MJ/kg for the oil samples, and the lower boiling range molecular distribution were obtained by the solvothermal liquefaction method with acetone as a solvent. The HHV of the oil samples obtained in the STL method (43.28–43.83 MJ/kg) is comparable to that of gasoline (HHV − 43.4 MJ/kg). The contribution of the solvent to the depolymerization reaction was mainly the dissolution and dispersion of feedstock by solvation, therefore reducing thermal cracking temperature through enhanced mass and thermal energy transfer. In thermal liquefaction, solvent and feedstock had a low level of solvolysis reactions, so the depolymerization reaction mainly follows thermal cracking. The main reaction path is the random scission of PE molecules during heat treatment, with a low level of polymerization, cyclization, and radical recombination reactions, which occurred through the free radical mechanisms. This work has demonstrated the feasibility of a very promising technique for effective chemical upcycling of polyethylene-based plastics.
