Pyrolysis-plasma/catalytic reforming of post-consumer waste plastics for hydrogen production Different types of single waste plastics and a range of real-world mixed waste plastics from several different industrial and commercial sources have been processed in a pyrolysis-plasma/catalytic experimental reactor system for the production of hydrogen. The hydrocarbons produced from the pyrolysis stage were catalytically (Ni/MCM-41) steam reformed in a low temperature, non-thermal plasma/catalytic reactor. The polyolefin plastics, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and polypropylene produced the highest yield of hydrogen at 18.0, 17.3 and 16.3 mmol g−1 plastics respectively. The aromatic structured polystyrene produced a lower hydrogen yield of 11.9 mmol g−1 plastics and polyethylene terephthalate with an aromatic and oxygenated structure produced only 10.2 mmol g−1 plastics and a high yield of carbon oxide gases. The real-world mixed plastic waste produced yields of hydrogen in the range of 13.4–16.9 mmol g−1 plastics. The lowest hydrogen yield of 13.4 mmol g−1 plastics was produced from the mineral water bottle packaging waste due to the high content of polyethylene terephthalate in the plastic waste mixture.
