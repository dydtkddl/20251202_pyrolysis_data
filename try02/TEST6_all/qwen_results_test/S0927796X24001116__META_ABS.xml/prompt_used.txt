You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic materials based on metals (ions) used in the upcycling of plastics and polymers into fuels and valuable chemicals as part of sustainable development Synthetic plastics have become an essential functional material in almost every aspect of the world around us. Their large-scale production is about 368 million tons per year and is expected to increase to about 800 million tons by 2050. Currently, less than 20 % of post-consumer plastic waste in developed countries is mechanically recycled, but recycled plastics lose their value - known as downcycling. An innovative approach is the upcycling process. The term "upcycling" refers to a form of secondary waste processing that results in higher-value products that are treated as valuable raw materials. It is necessary to use plastic waste as valuable raw materials to produce valuable hydrocarbons and fuels as part of climate neutrality and sustainable circular economy. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive, critical and accessible overview of the general interest of the chemical community, as it will cover the use of a wide range of catalysts in the upcycling of polymers and plastics. Plastics (re)upcycling technologies, innovative highly active transition metal (ion) based catalytic materials, their catalytic pathways and the feasibility of designing such materials are presented. The review is in line with global and urgent environmental, scientific and social needs, not only because of greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction, but also a key component of climate protection, which is one of the primary goals of sustainable development.
