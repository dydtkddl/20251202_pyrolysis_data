You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physicochemical alterations on UV aged polymers leading to microplastics formation: A multi-tiered study of polyester, polycarbonate and polyamide Plastic, once a revolutionary material, has progressively converted into a global environmental threat possessing ubiquitous distribution, with microplastics (MPs) pollution being in the center of intense multidisciplinary research. Within the framework of the present study, we systematically investigated the physicochemical properties of three widely used commercial polymers, namely poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polycarbonate (PC) and polyamide (PA) after UV exposure for certain intervals, as to enlighten the aging processes of these polymer types and ameliorate the understanding of their performance through a couple of analytical techniques. The studied polymers were UV-B aged for specific time periods and the photodegradation was initially evaluated by Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), proving signs of oxidation, while the crystallinity and thermal properties’ modifications during the weathering were also assessed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and water contact angle measurements demonstrated the significant morphological and hydrophilicity differences of the irradiated samples compared to the pristine ones, while mechanical performance deterioration was displayed as evidence that UV irradiation induces the reduction of plastics performance and their progressive fragmentation, possibly inducing the MPs formation. The relative abundance of the pyrolysis products fluctuated throughout the UV exposure experiments as determined by Pyrolysis‒Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py‒GC/MS) analysis, while the quantity of the pyrolytic marker compounds for the investigated polymers extensively utilized nowadays in MPs analysis also changed with the time of photo-aging, suggesting the imperative further exploration of aging processes on the well-known polymeric types, since severe risk exists with the reliability of MPs quantification in real environmental samples.
