You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mass-based fates of microplastics throughout wastewater treatment processes Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are crucial in removing microplastics from wastewater but also serve as essential point sources for microplastic pollution in environments. To address this issue by improving the microplastic removal efficiency, unveiling the mass-based fates of microplastics during treatments in STPs is essential, as these treatment systems are not specially designed to target microplastics. Herein, a thermodesorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC/MS) was developed to quantify the mass of five microplastics: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethyleneglycol terephthalate (PET) in the range of 0.22 μm–5.00 mm in size. Then, the approach was further applied to evaluate the mass-based fates of these microplastics throughout the whole STP treatment process. Results showed that PE was the most common polymer detected in influent (1313.11 ± 336.96 μg/L) and effluent (25.84 ± 3.75 μg/L), while PP was the least prevalent in influent (52.47 ± 11.49 μg/L) and PS in the effluent (2.74 ± 0.26 μg/L). Moreover, the proportion of the smallest particles (0.22–20 μm) was dominant in all samples. Based on mass estimations, an average of 95.82 % ± 2.02 % of microplastics were efficiently removed from the influent, with removal rates ranging from 92.55 % for PP to 98.03 % for PE. Moreover, the removal of microplastic mainly occurred in the primary treatment unit, and their removal efficiencies decreased as the microplastic concentrations decreased, regardless of their sizes and polymer types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the mass-based fates of microplastics in STP throughout wastewater treatment processes, enabling the comparison of microplastic removal efficiencies among studies to direct future improvements in the treatment process.
