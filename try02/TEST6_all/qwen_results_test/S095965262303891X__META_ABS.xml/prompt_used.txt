You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic and non-catalytic low-pressure hydrothermal liquefaction of pinewood sawdust, polyolefin plastics and their mixtures Hydrothermal co-liquefaction of biomass and polyolefin plastic feedstocks offers the advantage of potential synergistic reaction environments for producing liquid products of high fuel quality. In this present study, hydrothermal liquefaction and co-liquefaction of sawdust, low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene were investigated in a batch reactor from 350 °C to 450 °C and autogenic pressures below 30 bar. The novel low-pressure hydrothermal processing method was carried out with and without low-cost Ni–Cu/Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. Thermal degradation of the sawdust started at 350 °C, whereas the plastics could only completely degrade at 450 °C, which was then chosen as the optimum reaction temperature. The catalysed process led to an increase in oil yield from the sawdust, with carbon enrichment by 16.3% and 22% deoxygenation. Furthermore, the catalyst promoted the formation of ketones and aromatic hydrocarbons, while consuming phenols and furfural in the sawdust-derived bio-oils. For the plastics, the catalyst, gave slight decreases in oils yield in favour of gas and/or char formation, with the promotion of in situ hydrogenation to enhance the yields of alkanes over alkenes. Results from hydrothermal co-liquefaction tests showed that synergistic interactions occurred between the degradation products of sawdust and the plastics. The observed synergy was further promoted by the presence of the catalyst, leading to dramatic deoxygenation of the oil products to produce hydrocarbon-rich fuels with less than 4 wt% oxygen contents (≈90% deoxygenation). This low-pressure hydrothermal co-liquefaction process is an efficient and cost-effective pathway for single-loop conversion of widely available biomass and plastics feedstocks into highly deoxygenated oils for use as sustainable fuels.
