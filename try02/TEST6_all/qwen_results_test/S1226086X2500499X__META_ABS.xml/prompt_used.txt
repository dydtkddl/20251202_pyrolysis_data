You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production for a decarbonized future: a review of production technologies Hydrogen is increasingly viewed as an essential element in the global transition toward low-carbon and sustainable energy systems. This review systematically evaluates the major hydrogen production pathways, spanning mature fossil-based processes, steam methane reforming, dry methane reforming, catalytic methane decomposition, and coal gasification, to emerging renewable routes including biomass gasification, water electrolysis, photolytic methods, and biological/biochemical processes. Each technology is critically assessed through integrated techno-economic and environmental analyses, examining efficiency, carbon intensity, technological readiness levels, and scalability potential. Life cycle assessments reveal that conventional methods, while cost-effective ($1.25–2.27/kg H2), generate substantial CO2 emissions (9–20 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). Conversely, renewable pathways demonstrate significantly lower environmental impacts but face economic and technological barriers limiting commercial deployment. Key challenges identified include catalyst deactivation, high capital costs for electrolyzers, and low efficiencies in photolytic systems (∼5%). The review establishes strategic research priorities: developing durable, cost-effective catalysts; advancing high-temperature electrolysis technologies; integrating renewable energy systems; and scaling photobiological platforms. This analysis provides actionable insights for researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers to accelerate hydrogen technology development and deployment, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, hydrogen-based energy economy aligned with net-zero emission targets.
