You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization, techno-economic, and environmental assessment of co-pyrolysis of oil palm EFB and rubber wood sawdust This study optimized the co-pyrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) and rubber wood sawdust (RWS) to enhance biochar and liquid oil yields, with non-condensable gas (NCG) as a by-product. Experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor, varying key process parameters, including pyrolysis temperature (750–850 °C), biomass particle size (0.3–5 mm), and EFB: RWS ratio (0:100–100:0). Response surface methodology (RSM) with a Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed to analyze parameter interactions and optimize product distribution systematically. Statistical validation confirmed the model's reliability, with prediction errors below 10 %. The optimal biochar yield (33.73 wt%) was achieved at 782.25 °C, a particle size of 2.94 mm, and an EFB: RWS ratio of 6:94. In comparison, the highest liquid oil yield (28.46 wt%) was obtained at 850 °C, with a biomass size of 3.00 mm and an EFB: RWS ratio of 100:0. Co-pyrolysis offers flexibility to adjust product yields based on energy needs. Simulations proved the scalable design and economic analysis confirmed its financial viability with a payback period of just 5.8 years. The environmental evaluation was also conducted through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The LCA revealed that the pyrolysis process had the highest impact on global warming potential (GWP), contributing 61.15 %, followed by product utilization (estimated at 20 %), feedstock production (11.67 %), transportation (2.18 %), and end-of-life processes. This study shows the potential of using local biomass in Southern Thailand for sustainable energy. These findings pave the way for scaling up industrial pyrolysis, enhancing energy security, and waste valorization.
