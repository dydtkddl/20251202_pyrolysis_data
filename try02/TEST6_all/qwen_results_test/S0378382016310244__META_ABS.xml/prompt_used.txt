You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of aromatic hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis of lignin over acid-activated bentonite clay Natural bentonite clay (mainly sodium-rich montmorillonite) both purified and acid activated using HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4 acids were applied to the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignin. The modifications in crystalline structure and acidity of the activated clay were investigated via XRD, N2-adsorption-desorption, FTIR, TGA and NH3-TPD analysis. The activity and selectivity of the clays were evaluated for lignin conversion in down- flow micro reactor in the temperature range 500–650°0C in flowing Nitrogen (oxygen-free). The yields of high value added monocyclic aromatics such as BTX (benzene- toluene- xylenes) and naphthalene were increased by catalytic upgrading using HCl-activated bentonite clay. The selectivity for o&p-xylenes, naphthalene, and methyl naphthalene were greatly enhanced using HCl-activated bentonite in the temperature range 550–650°C. The catalyst: lignin ratio 3:1 and the nitrogen flow rate 75ml/min, at 600°C were the optimum conditions.
