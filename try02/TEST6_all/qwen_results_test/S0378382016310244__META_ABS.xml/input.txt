Production of aromatic hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis of lignin over acid-activated bentonite clay Natural bentonite clay (mainly sodium-rich montmorillonite) both purified and acid activated using HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4 acids were applied to the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignin. The modifications in crystalline structure and acidity of the activated clay were investigated via XRD, N2-adsorption-desorption, FTIR, TGA and NH3-TPD analysis. The activity and selectivity of the clays were evaluated for lignin conversion in down- flow micro reactor in the temperature range 500–650°0C in flowing Nitrogen (oxygen-free). The yields of high value added monocyclic aromatics such as BTX (benzene- toluene- xylenes) and naphthalene were increased by catalytic upgrading using HCl-activated bentonite clay. The selectivity for o&p-xylenes, naphthalene, and methyl naphthalene were greatly enhanced using HCl-activated bentonite in the temperature range 550–650°C. The catalyst: lignin ratio 3:1 and the nitrogen flow rate 75ml/min, at 600°C were the optimum conditions.
