Converting waste PET plastics to high value-added MOFs-based functional materials: A state of the art review Waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics in the environment are accumulated worldwide, posing a great threat to ecological security and human health. Considering that waste PET plastics contain rich industrial raw materials like terephthalic acid (H2BDC) and ethylene glycol (EG), it was essential to recycle waste PET plastics for the sustainable development of human society. Recent studies have indicated that waste PET plastics could be converted into high value-added metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their composites. In addition, producing MOFs using waste PET plastics via chemical recycling method displayed high potential in realizing closed-loop recycling of waste PET plastics. Up to now, PET-derived MOFs-based functional materials have been used in adsorption, separation, catalysis, advanced oxidation processes, supercapacitor and antibacterial. This review systematically summarized the recent advances in PET-derived MOFs-based functional materials, which will deepen the understanding of the preparation, characterization and applications of waste PET plastic-derived MOFs-based functional materials.
