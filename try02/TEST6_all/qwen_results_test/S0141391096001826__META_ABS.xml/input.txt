Effects of acids on thermal and thermo-oxidatiye degradation of polystyrene This study investigated the effects of three kinds of acids on the thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of polystyrene (PS). The studied additives were hydrogen zeolite Y, concentrated phosphoric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCJ/MS), thermochromatography (ThGC), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) were employed to investigate thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of the modified polystyrenes. The experimental results indicated that zeolite Y promoted thermal degradation and suppressed thermo-oxidative degradation of PS. Concentrated phosphoric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid promoted both thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation of PS.
