Preparation of presulfided oil-soluble NiMo catalyst for slurry bed hydrocracking of vacuum residue Here, a method is proposed for constructing presulfided oil-soluble NiMo catalysts using tetrathiomolybdate nickel ammonium as a precursor via a chelating ligand exchange strategy. Leveraging the close chemical bonding between Ni and Mo atoms, the NiMo catalyst can undergo in-situ self-sulfidation to generate active NiMoS sites and a composite structure of Ni3S2 and MoS2 nano phase in tight contact, thus exhibiting strong synergistic effects. The NiMo catalyst exhibited outstanding performance in hydrocracking of vacuum residue (VR) achieving a 64.7 wt% VR conversion while maintaining a coke yield of 0.51 wt%, as well as the excellent hydrogenation activity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Combined with density functional theory calculations, it was further revealed that the presence of Ni reduces the energy barrier for H2 dissociation on MoS2, thereby enhancing the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst and its ability to suppress coke formation. This work validates the efficient bimetallic synergistic catalytic effect of presulfided oil-soluble NiMo catalysts in the slurry bed hydrocracking process.
