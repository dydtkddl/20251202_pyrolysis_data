You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in recycling technologies for waste CIGS photovoltaic modules To mitigate the potential environmental and human health impacts of waste Copper–indium–gallium–diselenide (CIGS) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules, effective recycling management measures are imperative. This comprehensive review provides an overview of the structural characteristics of CIGS and various recycling technologies. Through an analysis of methods such as mechanical crushing and sorting, pyrolysis, pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electro-deposition, their effectiveness in CIGS recycling is elucidated. Mechanical crushing and sorting, as a straightforward technique, achieve a certain degree of separation between glass and metal, though further enhancement of product purity is warranted. Pyrolysis emerges as an effective recycling method, particularly excelling in polymer decomposition. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy emerge as crucial pathways for the recovery of Cu, In, Ga, and Se in CIGS, with pyrometallurgy achieving selenium removal through oxidative roasting, and hydrometallurgy requiring further optimization of solution systems and extractant selection. Electro-deposition technology efficiently accomplishes the high-yield recovery of multiple elements through differences in metal solubility and working potential yet faces challenges in scaling up production. The introduction of life cycle assessment analyzes the environmental impact of different technologies, providing a directional guide for module recycling research. In conclusion, this study delves deeply into the recycling, utilization, and resource recovery of waste CIGS, offering a scientific reference and guidance for future endeavors in clean and green recycling.
