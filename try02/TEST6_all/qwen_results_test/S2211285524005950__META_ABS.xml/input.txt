Advancements in recycling technologies for waste CIGS photovoltaic modules To mitigate the potential environmental and human health impacts of waste Copper–indium–gallium–diselenide (CIGS) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules, effective recycling management measures are imperative. This comprehensive review provides an overview of the structural characteristics of CIGS and various recycling technologies. Through an analysis of methods such as mechanical crushing and sorting, pyrolysis, pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electro-deposition, their effectiveness in CIGS recycling is elucidated. Mechanical crushing and sorting, as a straightforward technique, achieve a certain degree of separation between glass and metal, though further enhancement of product purity is warranted. Pyrolysis emerges as an effective recycling method, particularly excelling in polymer decomposition. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy emerge as crucial pathways for the recovery of Cu, In, Ga, and Se in CIGS, with pyrometallurgy achieving selenium removal through oxidative roasting, and hydrometallurgy requiring further optimization of solution systems and extractant selection. Electro-deposition technology efficiently accomplishes the high-yield recovery of multiple elements through differences in metal solubility and working potential yet faces challenges in scaling up production. The introduction of life cycle assessment analyzes the environmental impact of different technologies, providing a directional guide for module recycling research. In conclusion, this study delves deeply into the recycling, utilization, and resource recovery of waste CIGS, offering a scientific reference and guidance for future endeavors in clean and green recycling.
