You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of Sargassum spp. biomass as a promising source of electrocatalysts for energy generation based on life cycle assessment This work presents the development of an S-doped biocarbon electrocatalyst, designed to address environmental and economic challenges posed by the proliferation of Sargassum spp. along the shores of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The synthesis involves a two-step process: hydrothermal treatment followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C. This method produces a material with an exceptional surface area of 2142 m2g⁻1 and a high content of thiophene-type bonds (94.30 %). The unique composition of S-doped biocarbon results in superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, evidenced by an onset potential of 0.981 V vs Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) and a half-wave potential of 0.878 V vs RHE. Additionally, the electrocatalyst demonstrates remarkable electrochemical stability, maintaining performance with negligible mass activity loss after 5000 cycles. A significant application of S-doped biocarbon is demonstrated in a self-breathing Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (AEMFCs), achieving 76.82 % of the power density output compared to a commercial Pt electrocatalyst cathode. Furthermore, a life cycle assessment reveals that the synthesis of 1 g of S-doped biocarbon emits only 1.27 kg CO₂-eq, which is 3.84 % of the emissions attributed to Pt. Thus, S-doped biocarbon is an environmentally friendly biocarbon and a high-performing electrocatalyst for AEMFCs, positioning it as a promising alternative to Pt for green energy applications.
