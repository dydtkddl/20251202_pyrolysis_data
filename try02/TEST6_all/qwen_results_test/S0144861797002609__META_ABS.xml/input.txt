Characterization of grafted chitosan films Chitosan was prepared from chitin using a deacetylation process. The molecular weight and degree of deacetylation of chitosan were determined by viscosity and infrared spectroscopy respectively. Chitosan films were grafted by 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) using a60Co gamma-irradiation technique. The change in physico-chemical properties of modified films due to graft level of HEMA onto chitosan were estimated. The tensile properties of modified films decreased on increasing graft level. The grafted films showed improved thermal stability.
