You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bacterial cellulose carbon aerogel with ultra-high stress retention for flexible sensor In recent years, interest in biomass-derived conductive carbon aerogels for flexible wearable sensor devices has been increasing. This paper presents a novel, streamlined methodology for synthesizing nitrogen–phosphorus co-doped carbon aerogels from bacterial cellulose (BC) that exhibit exceptional mechanical and sensing properties. The strategic incorporation of ammonium and phosphate reduces defects during the carbonization phase. Substituting traditional solvents in the BC hydrogel with tert-butanol (TBA) preserves the integrity of the continuous three-dimensional aerogel network throughout lyophilization. Following pyrolysis under optimized carbonization conditions, the aerogels display regular, parallel microtubular structures that enhance their compression fatigue resistance. The resultant nitrogen–phosphorus co-doped BC carbon aerogel demonstrates an extraordinarily high stress retention rate (98.4 % after 1000 compression cycles) and maintains 100 % retention in cyclic compression tests, surpassing all similar compressible materials documented in the past five years. When employed in wearable piezoresistive pressure sensors, the carbon aerogel exhibits heightened sensitivity (0.57 kPa−1) and an extensive operational range (0.239–6.714 kPa), enabling the detection of diverse human movements.
