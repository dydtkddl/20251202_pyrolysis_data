You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel insights of HFO-1234ze(E) adsorption onto optimized carbons from sugarcane bagasse for thermal applications Activated carbon is essential in adsorption processes because of its extensive surface area, pore network, and abundant sorption sites. The conversion of waste biomass into value-added products not only provides an alternative to replace finite, non-eco-friendly resources but also advances Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 12 & 13) while promoting circular economy principles. In order to enhance their utility, the optimization of the synthesis route is crucial, as it improves quality, performance, and cost-effectiveness, making them attractive for industrial use. Therefore, this article explores two optimization strategies for producing sustainable microporous activated carbon from sugarcane bagasse (Saccharum officinarum), emphasizing detailed characterization and thermal applications. The sugarcane bagasse activated carbon (SBAC) production involves an environmentally benign carbonization route followed by potassium hydroxide activation. The experimental adsorption isotherms of HFO-1234ze(E) onto proposed adsorbents are obtained at temperatures of 30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C using a constant volume variable pressure (CVVP) setup, followed by numerical fitting to the Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) and Tóth isotherm models. The pore structural examination reveals that the SBAC600, optimized through the first strategy, exhibits a specific surface area of 2002 m2/g with 81 % micropores, while SBAC570, from the second strategy, possesses 1771 m2/g with 86 % micropores. The SBAC570/HFO-1234ze(E) demonstrates superior performance with the most excellent effective uptake of 0.4381 kg/kg at 80 °C and 3.65 bar evaporator pressure. Further, compared to existing literature, the proposed micropore-enriched adsorbents achieve substantial energy savings ranging from 42 % to 48 %, highlighting the optimized biomass adsorbents as excellent choices for effective and sustainable cooling applications.
