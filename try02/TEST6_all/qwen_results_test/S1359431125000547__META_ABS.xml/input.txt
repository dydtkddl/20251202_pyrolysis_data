Novel insights of HFO-1234ze(E) adsorption onto optimized carbons from sugarcane bagasse for thermal applications Activated carbon is essential in adsorption processes because of its extensive surface area, pore network, and abundant sorption sites. The conversion of waste biomass into value-added products not only provides an alternative to replace finite, non-eco-friendly resources but also advances Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 12 & 13) while promoting circular economy principles. In order to enhance their utility, the optimization of the synthesis route is crucial, as it improves quality, performance, and cost-effectiveness, making them attractive for industrial use. Therefore, this article explores two optimization strategies for producing sustainable microporous activated carbon from sugarcane bagasse (Saccharum officinarum), emphasizing detailed characterization and thermal applications. The sugarcane bagasse activated carbon (SBAC) production involves an environmentally benign carbonization route followed by potassium hydroxide activation. The experimental adsorption isotherms of HFO-1234ze(E) onto proposed adsorbents are obtained at temperatures of 30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C using a constant volume variable pressure (CVVP) setup, followed by numerical fitting to the Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) and Tóth isotherm models. The pore structural examination reveals that the SBAC600, optimized through the first strategy, exhibits a specific surface area of 2002 m2/g with 81 % micropores, while SBAC570, from the second strategy, possesses 1771 m2/g with 86 % micropores. The SBAC570/HFO-1234ze(E) demonstrates superior performance with the most excellent effective uptake of 0.4381 kg/kg at 80 °C and 3.65 bar evaporator pressure. Further, compared to existing literature, the proposed micropore-enriched adsorbents achieve substantial energy savings ranging from 42 % to 48 %, highlighting the optimized biomass adsorbents as excellent choices for effective and sustainable cooling applications.
