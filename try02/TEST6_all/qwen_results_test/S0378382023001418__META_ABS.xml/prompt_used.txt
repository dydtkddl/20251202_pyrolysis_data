You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stems and waste plastics into biochar-based briquette: Product characteristics and reaction mechanisms Industrial hemp stems and polyvinyl chloride are heat-treated at 400–800 °C to prepare cylindrical biochar-based briquette. The results show that the co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stems and Polyvinyl chloride degrade at 205–519 °C with a mass loss of 84.173 wt%. According to the TG-FTIR, the co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stems and polyvinyl chloride produces large amounts of volatiles such as CH4, CO, CO2 and HCl. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature and holding time, industrial hemp stems can produce biochar-based briquette with a lower O/C-H/C ratio. Polyvinyl chloride can significantly improve the durability of biochar-based briquette. Besides, polyvinyl chloride can significantly increase the high heating value of biochar-based briquette due to the HCl gas increases the fixed carbon content of biochar-based briquette in the preparation process. When industrial hemp stems and polyvinyl chloride at the ratio of 1:1, the maximum high heating value of biochar-based briquette can reach 29.475 MJ/kg. The concentration of Cl in biochar briquettes is 9.260 mg/g, mainly in the form of metal chloride. Therefore, biochar-based briquette has a potential application prospect in bioenergy production due to the remarkable improvement of its properties.
