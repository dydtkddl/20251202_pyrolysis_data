Synthesis, dispersion, functionalization, biological and antioxidant activity of metal oxide nanoparticles: Review Metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable properties with applications in diverse fields like human health, agriculture, and general community health. This has led to their widespread use across various scientific and industrial sectors. We focused on four specific types of MONPs: iron oxide, gadolinium oxide, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide nanoparticles due to their advantages over other metal oxides and noble metals, including cost-effectiveness, biocompatibility, and versatility. This review aimed to highlight examples of MONPs with various implementations and provide a comprehensive revision on the synthesis, dispersion, functionalization, biological and antioxidant activity of the selected MONPs. In this context, we demonstrated the applications of MONPs in various relevant domains and the impact of surface functionalization on the mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of MONPs, particularly in biological and antioxidant activities. Moreover, the volumetric, viscometric, and optical characteristics of MONPs dispersions and their stability challenges were significantly illustrated. The opportunities for MONPs in the global market based on market statistical studies were introduced in order to explore the current and future prospects for MONPs in the commercial market. This review paper offers a thorough and novel perspective on the synthesis, properties, functionalization, and applications of selected MONPs, along with their market potential, making it a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals. Our revision has sparked interest in the scientific pursuit of uncomplicated and intuitive ideas that make use of regenerative options.
