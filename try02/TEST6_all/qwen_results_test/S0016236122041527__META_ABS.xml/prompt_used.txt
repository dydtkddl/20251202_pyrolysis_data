You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of the impact of reactor residence time distribution on non-equilibrium product selectivity of polypropylene pyrolysis using reactive molecular dynamics simulations Mass residence time distribution (RTD) is considered to be an important factor controlling the product selectivity in the pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes along with the pyrolysis chemistry. However, due to the complex pyrolysis chemistry of biomass and plastic waste, the coupling between the reaction chemistry, RTD, and product selectivity is challenging to understand. We introduce a reaction molecular dynamics-based method to examine pyrolysis chemistry and species timescales to assess the impact of RTD on product selectivity and yield. To validate this method, reactive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for polypropylene pyrolysis and its non-equilibrium product selectivity using 6 different RTDs. We find that the RTD and the reaction chemistry control the peak non-equilibrium product concentrations. The peak monomer (C3H6) concentration during pyrolysis can be increased by up to 25 % by using a narrow RTD in the case of polypropylene pyrolysis. We also find that product selectivity is strongly affected by the average residence time and RTD. This coupling between the reaction chemistry, RTD, and product selectivity highlights the need to understand detailed reaction chemistry to control RTD and optimize non-equilibrium product selectivity during polymer and biomass pyrolysis. The present method provides a new way to design RTD for reactors to reach maximized product selectivity of plastic waste and biomass.
