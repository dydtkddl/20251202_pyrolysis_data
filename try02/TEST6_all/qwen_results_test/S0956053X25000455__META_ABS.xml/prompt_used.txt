You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and spent Li-ion battery cathodes: A combined metallurgy approach to recover valuable metals Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is crucial for the sustainable usage of critical raw materials present in the cathode. The combined metallurgy process is gaining significant attention in achieving this goal. The process includes thermal reduction followed by an environmentally friendly leaching process. In this work, the technological feasibility of a co-pyrolysis method is investigated for the recovery of Li2CO3 and transition metals from Li1-xNiyMnzCo1-y-zO2 (NMC) based cathode black mass (CBM) obtained from spent LiBs. We analyze the performance of polypropylene as a reducing agent during co-pyrolysis at 500 – 650 °C to reduce NMC. During co-pyrolysis, the reductive gases (H2 and CH4) generated from polypropylene reduce NMC at 550 – 650 °C into Ni-Co, MnO, and Li2CO3. However, an additional product, NiO and spinel NMC, appeared in co-pyrolyzed CBM at 500 °C. The magnetic fraction of the co-pyrolysis product was separated by water leaching, and then the leach solution was dried to recover Li2CO3. The lithium leaching efficiency achieved from the cathode black mass of NMC batteries is 92.80 ± 3.22 wt%. A liquid fuel obtained as a by-product of co-pyrolysis has a gross calorific value of 48 MJ/kg. The process promotes sustainability by efficiently reducing NMC at lower temperatures and producing a liquid by-product for fuel applications.
