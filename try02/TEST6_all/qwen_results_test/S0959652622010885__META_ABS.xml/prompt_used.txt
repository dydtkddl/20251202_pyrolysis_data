You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen and aromatics recovery through plasma-catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene Plasma-catalysis pyrolysis is a promising way to solve the problem of catalyst deactivation during plastic recycling. In this study, pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) over zeolite ZSM-5 has been carried out in a two-stage fixed bed pyrolysis system with a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. The role of plasma on the pyrolysis process, as well as the stability of the plasma-catalytic system was investigated. Compared to conventional catalytic pyrolysis, plasma-catalysis pyrolysis increased gas products from 29 wt% to 47 wt% with 4.19 mmol/g H2 formed, and improved the selectivity of BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) whilst inhibiting the production of wax simultaneously. After 10 cycles, clear decreases in gas and oil yield (from 86 wt% to 48 wt%) and BTX selectivity (from 71 wt% to 39 wt%) were found in the conventional catalytic pyrolysis, however, nearly no variation was shown in the plasma-catalysis mode. The coupling of catalyst and plasma modified the catalysts acidic sites, while the radicals enhanced the pre-cracking of volatiles, resulting in less deposited coke. Overall, the introduction of plasma resulted in an obvious reduction in total costs and presented a feasible strategy for the recycling of waste plastic.
