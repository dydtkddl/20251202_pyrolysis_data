You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable development of pulping by-product for limiting its pollution risk and production new aerogel-based carbon nanostructures for dyes adsorption A clean approach for disposing the pulping by-product (black liquors- BLs) as an effective component in preparing high surface area aerogel-based carbon nanostructure adsorbents was the objective of this current work. These novel adsorbents were assessed as a benefit for removing the cationic and anionic dyes. In this respect, black liquors from pulping of rice straw by different pulping reagents were used as components together with resorcinol in production of aerogel precursors for carbon nanostructures (CNSs). The effective role of BL-based aerogels was evidenced from comparing their CNSs adsorption capacities with CNSs of aerogels free from BLs, towards dyes together with iodine. Different isotherms (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-radushkevich (D-R) were studied to calculate the adsorption capacities. Results showed that CNSs from BL-based aerogels had higher adsorption capacities to dyes (methylene blue (MB) and brilliant blue (BB) than that produced in absence of BLs; where it increased from 256 to 307 mg/g and from 7 to 61 mg/g, respectively. The BLs from pulping of RS with alkaline reagents (NaOH and KOH–NH4OH) provided highest MB adsorbents, while highest adsorption of BB was noticed in case of BL from sulfite reagent, moreover this BL only provided improvement in Iodine value (increased from 752 to 968 mg/g). It is interesting to note that with this investigation we are able to overcome the problems of obtaining carbon nanomaterials from BLs or extracted lignin with low surface area. The surface area of the CNSs that produced through our investigation (1607 m2/g) surpassed the results from previous published work.
