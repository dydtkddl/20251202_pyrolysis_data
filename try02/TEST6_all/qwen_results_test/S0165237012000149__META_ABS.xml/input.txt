Mathematical modeling of rubber tire pyrolysis This article provides a critical review of past efforts over the last three decades at modeling the pyrolysis and gas activation of waste tires. The various forms of the Arrhenius kinetic rate equation as well as other forms of mathematical descriptions related to pyrolysis of waste tires are reviewed. In addition to reaction kinetics, other aspects of the tire pyrolysis such as heat and mass transfer, and reactor-specific models are also reviewed. Both one-step/component and multi-step/component pyrolysis models are discussed in the review. The multi-component models are based on the actual chemical components such as natural rubber and other additives. Kinetic constants reported in the literature are also analyzed.
