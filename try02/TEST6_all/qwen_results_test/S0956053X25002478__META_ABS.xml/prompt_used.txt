You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization of rabbit manure Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is an efficient process capable of treating organic waste without the need for a pre-drying step. Animal manure is among the waste that can be treated using HTC. Manure is a nutrient-rich waste produced in large quantities and contains pathogens; therefore, proper management is required. The use of microwave irradiation in HTC process is considered as a fast and efficient method to treat manure. Rabbit manure (RM) represents the main waste stream generated by rabbit farming activities. In this study microwave-assisted HTC of RM was performed and the effect of operating conditions on the characteristic of the products was evaluated. Hydrochars are produced by varying temperature (180 °C and 230 °C), residence time (30, 60 and 120 min) and solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratio (1/10 and 1/20). Moreover, the potential application in agriculture was evaluated. Results indicate that varying operation conditions have different effect on process products. Specifically, increasing treatment temperature from 180 °C to 230 °C leads to hydrochar yield reduction, while increasing severity of the treatment increases fixed carbon and total phosphorus content in the hydrochar. Thus, by applying the microwave-assisted HTC process in RM at 230 °C for 120 min and with an S/L ratio of 1/10, a hydrochar with an increased content of fixed carbon (17.5 %) and phosphorus (16.4 g/kg) was obtained. Subsequently, germination assays performed using the abovementioned hydrochar confirm a phytostimulatory effect at low application rates (5 %), while applying the HTC process water induces phytotoxicity, at all concentrations examined.
