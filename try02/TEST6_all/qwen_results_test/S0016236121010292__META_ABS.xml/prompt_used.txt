You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A biorefinery approach for high value-added bioproduct (astaxanthin) from alga Haematococcus sp. and residue pyrolysis for biochar synthesis and metallic iron production from hematite (Fe2O3) The present study aimed to investigate a biorefinery approach on natural astaxanthin production from the microalgae Haematococcus lacustris and biomass residue for biochar production through pyrolysis. Further, the biochar obtained from the H. lacustris residue was explored for iron oxide reduction using hematite iron ore through a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The alga H. lacustris cultivated in a low-cost polythene made photobioreactor (PBR) for a period of 32 days. During cultivation, several parameters were optimized for the enhanced biomass and astaxanthin accumulation. The results revealed that the highest biomass productivity of 3 g L−1 was found in acetate amended culture medium. Similarly, the addition of an extra carbon source (acetate) supported the highest astaxanthin productivity of 203 mg L−1, and it was observed during the red phase on day 32. The PBR volumetric biomass productivity of H. lacustris was estimated at up to 79.8 tonnes/acre/year. In this study, the alga H. lacustris grown in polythene made PBR produced the highest natural astaxanthin yield of 6.76%/cell dry weight (CDW). Further, the residual biomass was pyrolyzed through a non-catalytic process to obtain the maximum biochar yield. A mini pellet was synthesized using H. lacustris biochar and hematite (Fe2O3), and it was taken for metallic iron production under a nitrogen atmosphere. The results revealed that the biochar was supported for maximum metallic iron (Fe) production at ≥975 °C. This is the first study demonstrating the utilization of microalgae H. lacustris for natural astaxanthin production and biomass residue for metallic iron (Fe) production at low-cost methods.
