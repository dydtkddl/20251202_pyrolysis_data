You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics and nanoplastics on Mt. Everest Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), recognized as contaminants of emerging concern, have been identified even in remote regions. However, their abundance, distribution, and environmental impacts on Mt. Everest remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the abundance of MPs in soil, water, atmospheric, snow, yak dung, and road dust samples on Mt. Everest, with average concentrations of MPs being 65.0 items·kg−1, 3.8 items·L−1, 6.9 items·(m2·d)−1, 95.0 items·L−1, 36.5 items·kg−1, and 23.4 items·kg−1, respectively. For the first time, the abundance of NPs on Mt. Everest is quantified, revealing concentrations of 4.9 mg·kg−1 in soil, 1.9 mg·L−1 in water, and 0.13 items·(m2·d)−1 in atmospheric samples. Notably, polyethylene is the predominant polymer type, accounting for 86.0% (w/w) of all detected NPs. Additionally, our data suggest that MPs exhibit greater bacterial community diversity and evenness compared with those in surrounding soil environments. This work provides quantitative evidence of MNP pollution on Mt. Everest.
