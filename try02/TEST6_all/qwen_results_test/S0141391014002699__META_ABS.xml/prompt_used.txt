You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The flame retardancy and thermal property of poly (ethylene terephthalate)/cyclotriphosphazene modified by montmorillonite system The flame retardancy and thermal properties of neat poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and flame-retarded PET were investigated. hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene modified by montmorillonite (HCCP-OMMT) was used as the flame retardant. The composites were prepared by melt blending neat PET with flame retardant and named as PET/HCCP-OMMT. Three levels of HCCP-OMMT (1%, 3% and 5%) were considered for the blends. Thermal property of PET/HCCP-OMMT composites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and only 3% additive was found to significantly enhance the thermal stability of PET both in air and nitrogen at high temperature. It was found that the composites could pass UL-94 V-0 and LOI value 31.5 just containing 3% of HCCP-OMMT. The Py-GC/MS study showed that the cyclotriphosphazene and montmorillonite still remained in the residue during the pyrolysis of HCCP-OMMT. Besides that, the introduction of HCCP-OMMT would inhibit the pyrolysis of PET during heating or burning. The morphology and the chemical structure of the charred residue were detected by SEM and FTIR respectively. Results demonstrated that a good barrier was provided by the char of composites and improved the thermal behaviors during burning. TEM results suggested that intercalating type composite by melt blending can be formed.
