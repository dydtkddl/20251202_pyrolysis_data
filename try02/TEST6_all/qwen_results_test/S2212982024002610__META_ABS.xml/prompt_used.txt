You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improving hypercrosslinked polymer CO2/N2 selective separation through tuning polymer's porous properties: Optimization using RSM-BBD This study investigates the effect of synthesis and operating parameters on the adsorption of CO2 and N2 and the CO2/N2 selectivity of a hypercrosslinked adsorbent based on waste-expanded polystyrene. Six factors were examined, including synthesis time, crosslinker and catalyst amounts, adsorption temperature and pressure, and CO2 percentage in the mixture. The response surface methodology (RSM) and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) were employed to design the experiment. After synthesizing 19 adsorbents under different conditions, characterization tests were conducted. Results indicate that the specific surface area and micropore volume initially increase and then decrease with increased synthesis time, crosslinker, and catalyst amounts. The highest specific surface area and micropore volume were 803.84 m2/g and 0.1355 cm3/g, respectively. CO2/N2 selectivity and the adsorption of CO2 and N2 also increase and decrease with increased synthesis parameters. Furthermore, it was observed that CO2 adsorption and CO2/N2 selectivity increased with an increase in pressure and CO2 percentage and a decrease in temperature, while N2 adsorption decreased. The adsorbents were optimized using RSM to maximize CO2 adsorption and CO2/N2 selectivity with a target of 15 % CO2 in the gas mixture. The optimal synthesis parameters for the hypercrosslinked adsorbent, including synthesis time, crosslinker, and catalyst amounts, were determined to be approximately 13 hours, 30 mmol, and 30 mmol, respectively. Under optimal conditions for flue gas applications (CO2:N2/15:85), the adsorbent demonstrated a CO2/N2 selectivity of 11.05, making it suitable for flue gas capture.
