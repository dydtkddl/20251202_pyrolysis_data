You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on advances in sustainable energy production through various catalytic processes by using catalysts derived from waste red mud Conversion of wastes to energy and other value-added products is considered as a suitable method towards energy security. Wastes from various sources are becoming potential feedstocks for energy production through different techniques. The economy and sustainability of these processes demand the use of low-cost catalysts. Red mud (RM) is one of the most abundantly produced industrial wastes from aluminum industries. Such a huge production of RM, its alkaline nature and the presence of a small quantity of radioactive elements make it an environmental liability. Out of various utilization methods, RM as a catalyst for different chemical processes has been very successful. Presence of many valuable metals in RM, in particular, Fe makes it a suitable catalyst for energy production through processes such as pyrolysis, hydrotreating, transesterification and H2 production from biomass and other sources. This article critically reviews the advances in sustainable energy production through different processes mentioned above by RM based catalysts. Different characterization, activation and stability study of RM along with outcomes and mechanism of these processes are discussed. Furthermore, drawbacks associated with the low catalytic activity of RM and works that need to be carried out in the future for the improvement of its catalytic activity are discussed in detail.
