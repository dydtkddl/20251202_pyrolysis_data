You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tri-s-triazines (s-heptazines)—From a “mystery molecule” to industrially relevant carbon nitride materials This review provides a comprehensive overview about the fascinating history and chemistry of s-heptazines in its ionic, molecular and polymeric forms – their synthesis, structure, properties and (potential) applications. The very stable aromatic s-heptazine (tri-s-triazine) C6N7 moiety has been discovered as early as in the 1830s, when Liebig, Berzelius and Gmelin independently synthesized the first s-heptazine derivatives. However, the correct tricyclic molecular structure was first proposed by L. Pauling about 100 years later. He obviously was intrigued by selected C6N7-derivatives until he died since the structure of a so-called “mystery molecule” C6N7(OH)2N3, which has not been synthesized so far, was later found on the chalkboard in his office. Very few s-heptazines including the parent molecule C6N7H3 (6) were synthesized and unambiguously analysed until the beginning of the 21st century. Due to the proposed ultrahardness of 3D carbon(IV) nitride networks C3N4 in the 1980/90s several researchers became interested in s-heptazines as precursors for novel carbon(IV) nitrides. Besides, in the patent literature numerous claims for the application of s-heptazines (and s-triazines C3N3X3) as flame retardants and for other applications are found. Thus, the formation, structure and properties of key molecular derivatives such as cyameluric chloride C6N7Cl3 (4), melem C6N7(NH2)3 (1), cyameluric acid C6N7(OH)3 (2), selected symmetric and asymmetric amides C6N7(NR1R2)3− x (NR3R4) x , cyameluric esters C6N7(OR)3 and s-heptazine triazide C6N7(N3)3 (5) have been reported in recent years. In addition, various metal melonates M(I) 3[C6N7(NCN)3], metal cyamelurates M(I) 3[C6N7(O)3], s-heptazine-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and melon [C6N7(NH2)(NH)] n were analysed in detail. Also, numerous reports on so-called carbon nitrides, which are in fact melon-related C/N/H-oligomers and polymers, have been reported recently. Although the structure of these materials is not known in detail, their properties as well as the properties of the above mentioned thoroughly analysed compounds provide a very promising outlook for various applications of carbon nitrides and C/N/H materials including s-heptazines, especially in the field of novel semiconducting materials, (photo)catalysts e.g. for hydrogen generation and carbon dioxide fixation, luminescent and in other ways optically active materials. Many of the latter characteristics have been investigated very recently and in most cases supported by experimental and theoretical studies.
