You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave process of oily sludge produced at NRC Baiji to micro-char solid carbon production This research aimed to purify the environment of undesired substances by converting oily sludge (OS) micro-char fuel generation by microwave. The North Refineries Company (NRC) Baiji was the source of the OS sample utilized in this study. Micro-char manufacture, which has improved solid carbon characteristics, uses various microwave power and irradiation times. The parameters conditions at a range of power: feed of 5 g, 10 min of irradiation time, and microwave power ranges of 200, 400, and 600 W, respectively, under a nitrogen pressure of 3 L/min. While at the range of irradiation time: the feed was 5 g, microwave power was fixed at 600 W (the best microwave power discovered), and the range of irradiation duration was 5, 10, and 15 min. The ideal circumstances were (5 g, 600 W, and 15 min, under N2 pressure). The fuel ratio was increased from 0.70 to 0.97 OS with a 38.57% rise in the percentage of micro-char at 600 W and 15 min of irradiation time, while the HHV was increased from 9.40 to 17.22 MJ/kg at a rate of 83.20% as finding micro-char had improved as a solid carbon fuel. In general, micro-char has a fuel ratio and a higher HHV, making it suitable for solid carbon fuel in the oil industry.
