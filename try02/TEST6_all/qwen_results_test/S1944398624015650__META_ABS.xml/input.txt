Microwave process of oily sludge produced at NRC Baiji to micro-char solid carbon production This research aimed to purify the environment of undesired substances by converting oily sludge (OS) micro-char fuel generation by microwave. The North Refineries Company (NRC) Baiji was the source of the OS sample utilized in this study. Micro-char manufacture, which has improved solid carbon characteristics, uses various microwave power and irradiation times. The parameters conditions at a range of power: feed of 5 g, 10 min of irradiation time, and microwave power ranges of 200, 400, and 600 W, respectively, under a nitrogen pressure of 3 L/min. While at the range of irradiation time: the feed was 5 g, microwave power was fixed at 600 W (the best microwave power discovered), and the range of irradiation duration was 5, 10, and 15 min. The ideal circumstances were (5 g, 600 W, and 15 min, under N2 pressure). The fuel ratio was increased from 0.70 to 0.97 OS with a 38.57% rise in the percentage of micro-char at 600 W and 15 min of irradiation time, while the HHV was increased from 9.40 to 17.22 MJ/kg at a rate of 83.20% as finding micro-char had improved as a solid carbon fuel. In general, micro-char has a fuel ratio and a higher HHV, making it suitable for solid carbon fuel in the oil industry.
