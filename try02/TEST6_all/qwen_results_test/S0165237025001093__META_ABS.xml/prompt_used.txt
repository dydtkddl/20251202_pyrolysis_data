You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-dimensional plot of Py-GC based on retention index to depict the compositional distribution of pyrolysates of olefin polymers Pyrolysis-gas chromatography is utilized as an effective method for the characterization of polymers. The notorious complexity of the resultant pyrograms, however, makes it difficult to overview and compare the numerous pyrogram differences. Inspired by Kendrick mass defect plots used in high-resolution mass spectrometry, we propose here a new form of graphical representation of the chemical structure of polymers that visualizes the distribution of a set of pyrolysates on a two-dimensional plot that is based on the retention index (RI). When the elution time of a chromatographic peak is expressed relative to the carbon number of the n-alkane, the integer part should reflect the carbon number, and the decimal part should reflect the structural difference from the saturated version of the same hydrocarbon. We proceeded by dividing the RI/100 values into integer and decimal parts and created a two-dimensional plot, which we call an RI defect (RID) plot. To explain the features and effectiveness of this method, we present here several examples of its application to the characterization of polyolefins. The RID plot is first demonstrated by applying it to the identification of polyethylenes (PEs) with different short-chain branching patterns and polypropylenes (PPs) with different stereoregularities. This technique was further applied to the characterization of recycled PP resins, by which we were able to visualize the compositional distribution of minor PE components of major PP. Furthermore, a differential reading technique combined with the RID plot allowed for a rough classification of recycled PP based on the composition of the PE components.
