You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical upcycling of polyolefins into liquid refinery feedstock from the circularity and chemical engineering aspects Three quarters of all plastics produced each year are discarded to landfill after a single use without proper waste management practices, causing a global environmental crisis: waste plastics suffocating our world at enormously large volumes. Discarding plastics into landfill, inefficiently processing them to lower value materials, or incinerating them cause an irreversible loss of the stored energy in plastics. These plastics, however, represent a tremendous resource for the production of chemicals and can be upcycled into high-quality value-added refinery feedstock that could be used to produce virgin polyolefins. In this article, we review pyrolysis and hydrogenolysis based chemical transformations to convert waste polyolefins into liquid hydrocarbons with a special emphasis on life cycle assessment (LCA), reactor technologies, and integration to existing refineries. Several patented technologies are described in detail to shed a light on engineering aspects of the chemical recycling. Liquid products obtained from chemical recycling are examined from the circularity point of view. Feedstock and stream locations in existing refineries and around steam crackers are recommended to feed and/or blend the products obtained from chemical recycling of polyolefins. Challenges, perspectives, and emerging areas of research and engineering are mentioned.
