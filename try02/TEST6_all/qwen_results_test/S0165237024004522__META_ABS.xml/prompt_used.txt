You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading vacuum residue in a supercritical CO2 environment with polypropylene and steam: Insights into products distribution and characterization of liquid products The pyrolysis of vacuum residue (VR) using polypropylene (PP) under supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) conditions represents a novel approach to converting this abundant and difficult-to-process feedstock into lighter liquid products. In this paper, a set of experiments was performed to analyze the impact of scCO2, PP and steam on the yields of pyrolysis products (i.e., liquid, gas and coke) and characteristics of the liquid fractions. The findings indicated notable improvements when scCO2 was used instead of subcritical CO2 in the pyrolysis of VR with PP. These included decreased viscosity and improved API gravity, alongside increased maltene yield and reduced coke yield. Furthermore, the inclusion of PP markedly elevated the quality of the obtained liquid, whereas steam + scCO2 primarily affected the product distribution by raising the yield of coke and gas fractions. VR pyrolysis under scCO2 conditions at 380 °C, 8 MPa, PP/VR ratio of 0.23 for 60 min in a batch system, without the use of catalyst, resulted in the highest liquid yield of 83.7 ± 1.9 wt%, and minimum coke yield of 9.8 ± 1.3 wt%. Under these conditions, the upgraded liquid consisted of 75.2 wt% light and middle distillates with boiling points below 350 °C. Additionally, the proportion of oxygenates in the pyrolysis oil reduced by 60.5 %, improving its heating value. Moreover, adding PP to the upgrading process resulted in a higher proportion of isoparaffins, cycloparaffins, and aromatics, coupled with a decrease in olefins, aligning the liquid specifications more closely with fuel standards.
