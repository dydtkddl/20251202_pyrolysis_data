Extending the molecular application range of gas chromatography Gas chromatography is an important analytical technique for qualitative and quantitative analysis in a wide range of application areas. It is fast, provides a high peak capacity, is sensitive and allows combination with a wide range of selective detection methods including mass spectrometry. However, the application area of GC is limited because the molecules to be analysed have to be thermally stable and sufficiently volatile. Numerous molecules do not meet these requirements and hence are not amenable to direct GC analysis. Recent research has resulted in better chromatographic columns and methods for sample preparation that enable a significant expansion of the molecular application range of GC. The strategies exploited include conversion of (macro)molecules into smaller species and approaches to reduce the polarity of molecules. In this review we identify four generic routes for extending the applicability of GC. These include high-temperature GC, derivatisation, pyrolysis and thermochemolysis. The principles, recent developments and future perspectives of these routes are discussed and examples of applications using the different options will be shown. Life sciences, metabonomics and profiling strategies for sample characterization are identified as important future drivers for the continued development of GC.
