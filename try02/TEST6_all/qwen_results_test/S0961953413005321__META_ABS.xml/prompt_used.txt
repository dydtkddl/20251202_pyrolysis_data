You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Promises in direct conversion of cellulose and lignocellulosic biomass to chemicals and fuels: Combined solvent–nanocatalysis approach for biorefinary This review surveys sustainable one-pot conversion methods of cellulose into two very important platform chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and isosorbide retaining applications in many fields. Various new techniques based on such as ionic liquids, acid functionalized mesoporous materials, organic acids, functionalized nanoparticles, and mechanocatalytic depolymerization was discussed in detail for the very important direct conversion of cellulose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. More emphasis is given on a comparative analysis of recently developed all successful methods for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural production from cellulose in terms of efficiency, selectivity and cost-effectiveness. The article also complements on the promising extraction methods for the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using special solvents. The importance of another very interesting platform chemical, i.e. isosorbide is also addressed. Several factors of cellulose to isosorbide transformation including metal nanoparticle size, crystallinity order of the cellulose, and extraction medium which controls the rate of conversion and product distillation have been addressed. The article also surveys the potential discoveries in one-pot conversion of cellulose into biofuels. The strategies of cellulose and lignocellulose conversions to compounds with liquid fuel's features have been discussed focusing on the production of γ-valerolactone as important intermediates to access liquid hydrocarbons and valeric esters. Cellulose value-chain for the direct conversions to liquid fuels (e.g. cellulose to levulinic acid platform to obtain valeric biofuels) by using supported nanostructured metal catalysts are emphasized. Overall an analysis of the main prospects and constraints related to the several conversion routes are presented including the critical thinking on the technical barriers, commercial promise, and environmental issues.
