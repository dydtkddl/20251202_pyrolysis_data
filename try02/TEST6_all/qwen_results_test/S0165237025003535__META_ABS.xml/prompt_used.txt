You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A dual-stage machine learning framework for comprehensive characterization of waste plastic pyrolysis oils Pyrolysis is a promising approach to recycling plastic waste by converting it into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, process optimization is hindered by complex interdependencies among critical factors (e.g., plastic composition, pyrolysis temperature, and catalyst acidity) and empirical limitations (e.g., small datasets, nonlinear dependencies, and insufficient mechanistic understanding of composition-specific pathways) in predicting product distributions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dual-stage machine learning framework for the comprehensive characterization of waste plastic pyrolysis oils, including their yield prediction and detailed compositional analysis. In the first stage, four single models (DT, RF, SVR, and XGB) were employed to predict oil yields, with XGB achieving superior accuracy (R² = 0.959) and SHAP analysis identifying pyrolysis temperature and catalyst acidity as dominant influencing factors. The second stage introduced a stacking-based fusion model to predict detailed oil compositions (alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics), outperforming single models by effectively capturing high-dimensional nonlinearities and feature interactions. The catalyst properties are the most influential for composition, with partial dependence plots delineating optimal conditions (e.g., 530°C for alkanes and 620°C for aromatics) and suggesting acid-catalyzed conversion of alkenes to aromatics. By bridging empirical correlations with mechanistic insights, this framework enables targeted pyrolysis optimization for high-value oil production. The study advances plastic waste valorization through integrated yield and compositional analysis, providing a transformative tool for sustainable resource recovery and circular economy applications.
