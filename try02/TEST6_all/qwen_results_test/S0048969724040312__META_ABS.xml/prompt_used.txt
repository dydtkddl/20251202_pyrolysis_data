You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and eucalyptus waste wood for fuel pellets production: A study of fuel, mechanical, and combustion characteristics under varying binder proportion The study explores the effect of varying molasses proportions as a binder on the characteristics of densified char obtained through the slow co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and Eucalyptus wood waste (Waste low-density polyethylene – Eucalyptus wood (WLDPE–EW) and Waste Polystyrene – Eucalyptus wood (WPS–EW)). Pyrolysis was conducted at 500 °C with a residence time of 120 min, employing plastic to wood waste ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 (w/w). The focus was on how varying the proportion of molasses (10–30 %), influences the physical and combustion properties of the resulting biofuel pellets. Our findings reveal that the calorific value of the pellets decreased from 28.94 to 27.44 MJ/Kg as the molasses content increased. However, this decrease in calorific value was compensated by an increase in pellet mass density, which led to a higher energy density overall. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of solid bridges between particles, facilitated by molasses, effectively decreasing particle spacing. The structural integrity of the pellets, as measured by the impact resistance index, improved significantly (43–47 %) with the addition of molasses. However, a significant change in the combustion characteristics depicted by lower ignition and burnout temperatures were observed due to decrease in fixed carbon value and increase in volatile matter content, as the proportion of molasses increased. Despite these changes, the pellets demonstrated a stable combustion profile, suggesting that molasses are an effective binder for producing biofuel pellets through the densification of char derived from the co-pyrolysis of plastic and Eucalyptus wood waste. The optimized molasses concentration analyzed through multifactor regression analysis was 16.96 % with 28 % WLDPE proportion to produce WLDPE–EW char pellets. This study highlights the potential of using molasses as a sustainable binder to enhance the mechanical and combustion properties of biofuel pellets, offering a viable pathway for the valorization of waste materials.
