You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic upgrading of biomass-derived vapors on carbon aerogel-supported Ni: Effect of temperature, metal cluster size and catalyst-to-biomass ratio A comprehensive study of carbon aerogel-supported nickel (Ni/CAG) in the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of torrefied Eucalyptus globulus was performed in a micropyrolysis unit (Py-GCMS). Effects of pyrolysis temperatures (450–600 °C), catalyst-to-biomass ratio (1:1 < C-to-B < 10:1) and metal cluster sizes (9.6 < Dpi < 21) on upgrading reactions were analyzed. Catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption at 77 K, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Regardless the use of catalysts, the pyrolysis vapors produced from torrefied biomass were depleted in carboxylic acids (selectivity < 7%). Furthermore, the CFP decreased the selectivity to furans and ketones by almost 50%, while phenols increased in a similar proportion. Despite the similarities in the selectivity distribution of these functional groups in all the CFP experiments, their internal composition was rather different owing to the changes in temperature, C-to-B ratio and catalyst cluster sizes. Ni/CAG was active for hydrogenation under H2-depleted atmosphere, presumably by a synergistic effect between water gas shift and reforming reactions with transalkylation and decarbonylation of phenolics and furanics. It was demonstrated that metal cluster sizes influenced the reaction routes by favoring hydrogenation on metal facets and deoxygenation on step/corners sites.
