You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of anhydrous manganese hypophosphite microtubes for simultaneous flame retardant and mechanical enhancement on poly(lactic acid) In this study, a facile solvothermal approach for preparing anhydrous manganese hypophosphite (A-MnHP) microtubes was demonstrated for the first time by using manganese chloride and hypophosphorous acid in mixed solvents, followed by fabricating A-MnHP-based poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites via a melt-blending method. Owing to the unique morphology of A-MnHP, the tensile strengths of the PLA composites with 1 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% A-MnHP are approximately 17%, 7% and 3% higher than those of neat PLA, respectively. Compared to neat PLA, PLA composite containing 15 wt% A-MnHP (PLA/A-MnHP15) exhibited lower peak heat release rate (50% reduction), total heat release (13% reduction), peak CO2 and CO productions (50% and 53% reductions), which also passed UL 94 V-2 rating test with high limiting oxygen index (27.5%). The combustion temperature change during the cone calorimeter tests showed that PLA/A-MnHP15 showed the lowest combustion temperature, achieving the best fire safety performance. Residue analysis indicated that the presence of A-MnHP resulted in the formation of continuous and compact char residues composed of aromatic structure and phosphorous-rich inorganic structure, retarding the permeation of heat, oxygen transfer and escape of volatile degradation products.
