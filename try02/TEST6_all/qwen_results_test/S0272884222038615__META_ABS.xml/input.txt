A review on the preparation and application of BN composite coatings Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a kind of functional ceramic material with excellent physical and chemical properties. This paper analyzes it from the aspects of mechanical, thermal, electrical and wetting properties. However, the high melting point of hexagonal boron nitride makes it difficult to prepare coating materials by traditional sintering process. This paper summarizes several processes for preparing h-BN composite coatings. Then, several application forms of h-BN composite coatings are reviewed according to the characteristics of h-BN composite coatings, and the future application prospects of h-BN coatings are forecasted in view of the existing problems.
