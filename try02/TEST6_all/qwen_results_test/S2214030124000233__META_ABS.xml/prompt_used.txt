You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From plastic waste to bioprocesses: Using ethylene glycol from polyethylene terephthalate biodegradation to fuel Escherichia coli metabolism and produce value-added compounds Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is a petroleum-based plastic polymer that, by design, can last decades, if not hundreds of years, when released into the environment through plastic waste leakage. In the pursuit of sustainable solutions to plastic waste recycling and repurposing, the enzymatic depolymerization of PET has emerged as a promising green alternative. However, the metabolic potential of the resulting PET breakdown molecules, such as the two-carbon (C2) molecule ethylene glycol (EG), remains largely untapped. Here, we review and discuss the current state of research regarding existing natural and synthetic microbial pathways that enable the assimilation of EG as a carbon and energy source for Escherichia coli. Leveraging the metabolic versatility of E. coli, we explore the viability of this widely used industrial strain in harnessing EG as feedstock for the synthesis of target value-added compounds via metabolic and protein engineering strategies. Consequently, we assess the potential of EG as a versatile alternative to conventional carbon sources like glucose, facilitating the closure of the loop between the highly available PET waste and the production of valuable biochemicals. This review explores the interplay between PET biodegradation and EG metabolism, as well as the key challenges and opportunities, while offering perspectives and suggestions for propelling advancements in microbial EG assimilation for circular economy applications.
