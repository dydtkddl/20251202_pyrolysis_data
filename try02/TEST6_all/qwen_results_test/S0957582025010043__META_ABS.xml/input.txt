Full-scale application and performance of hybrid Fenton electrochemical reactor as post treatment for WWTP of textile industry A full-scale hybrid Fenton-electrochemical (HFE) reactor with a capacity of 150 L has been developed for the post-treatment of textile wastewater. The setup includes 30 pairs of Ti/RuIrO2 mesh cylinders (Ø×ℓ: 5 × 50 cm) and copper pipes (Ø×ℓ: 2 × 55 cm) in a circulated system. The reactor demonstrated potential performance in terms of color removal (75 %) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (25.5 %) after 45 min. The kinetics of color and COD removal follow second-order reactions with rate constants (k2) of 1 × 10−4 and 5 × 10−5 (mg/L)−1.min−1, respectively. The addition of Fe(II) at acidic pH improved color and COD removal by 87 % and 34 %, respectively. The lowest operational cost (0.29 USD/m3) to achieve the regulated standard limit was obtained at 2 g/L salt, 6.5 V potential, 290 A, and 60 min of processing time. In terms of treated wastewater volume, the ideal operating conditions were 4 g/L salt, 0.09 g/L Fe(II), pH 4, and 15 min processing time, as these parameters increased the volume by 4-fold. With a 0.25 USD/m3 cost decrease, the HFE reactor becomes more practical than the Decoloring Agent (DCA) method, and the investment can be recovered after 0.76 years.
