You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Full-scale application and performance of hybrid Fenton electrochemical reactor as post treatment for WWTP of textile industry A full-scale hybrid Fenton-electrochemical (HFE) reactor with a capacity of 150 L has been developed for the post-treatment of textile wastewater. The setup includes 30 pairs of Ti/RuIrO2 mesh cylinders (Ø×ℓ: 5 × 50 cm) and copper pipes (Ø×ℓ: 2 × 55 cm) in a circulated system. The reactor demonstrated potential performance in terms of color removal (75 %) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (25.5 %) after 45 min. The kinetics of color and COD removal follow second-order reactions with rate constants (k2) of 1 × 10−4 and 5 × 10−5 (mg/L)−1.min−1, respectively. The addition of Fe(II) at acidic pH improved color and COD removal by 87 % and 34 %, respectively. The lowest operational cost (0.29 USD/m3) to achieve the regulated standard limit was obtained at 2 g/L salt, 6.5 V potential, 290 A, and 60 min of processing time. In terms of treated wastewater volume, the ideal operating conditions were 4 g/L salt, 0.09 g/L Fe(II), pH 4, and 15 min processing time, as these parameters increased the volume by 4-fold. With a 0.25 USD/m3 cost decrease, the HFE reactor becomes more practical than the Decoloring Agent (DCA) method, and the investment can be recovered after 0.76 years.
