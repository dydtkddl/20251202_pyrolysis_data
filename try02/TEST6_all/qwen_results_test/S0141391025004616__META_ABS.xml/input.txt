New insights into solid state phosphorylation of cellulose for the development of bio-based flame retardant The phosphorylation of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) has been investigated as a strategy to develop bio-based flame retardants, aiming to enhance their charring ability and thermal stability. The modification process was performed using solid-state mechanochemistry, employing varying excesses of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) to optimize the phosphorus grafting rate. It was discovered that, with a significant P2O5 excess, contact of the recovered blend with a small amount of water induces a vigorous reaction. This reaction leads to cellulose expansion and its conversion into a graphitic structure, while also allowing for the grafting of a high phosphorus content. This phosphorylated graphitic cellulose demonstrated a superior flame retardant effect in polypropylene (PP), achieving a 55 % reduction in peak heat release rate (pHRR) even at a relatively low incorporation content (12.5 wt.%), while also conserving composite ductility.
