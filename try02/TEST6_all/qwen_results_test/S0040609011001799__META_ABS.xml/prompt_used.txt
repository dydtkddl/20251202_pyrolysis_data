You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells processed from solution pastes with polymethyl methacrylate binder A non-vacuum, solution-based method is investigated to deposit thin layers of Cu(In,Ga)Se2, which is the core component of CIGS thin film solar cells. The concept is based on paste coating of Cu, In, and Ga salt solution with an organic binder and a subsequent annealing of the paste in selenium atmosphere. Previous experiments with ethylcellulose as the binder resulted in photo conversion efficiencies up to 6.7%, although further improvements were hindered by a limited thickness of the CIGS layer and a residual carbon layer between the CIGS and metal back contact. In the present work, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is tested as an alternative binder material, which theoretically should leave no char residues upon thermal degradation at temperatures higher than 350°C. A series of pastes with different solvents are prepared and the resulting CIGS layers are investigated systematically by microscopy, SEM, EDX, XRF, and XRD. Absorber layers are processed into Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO solar cells and their I–V characteristics are measured. PMMA can be used as the organic binder alternative to cellulose and more complete evaporation of the organic matrix is achieved as compared to the reference cellulose-containing recipe. However, maximum solar cell efficiencies are limited to 3% because the obtained CIGS layers are porous and contain traces of parasitic oxide phases when heated above 330°C in ambient atmosphere.
