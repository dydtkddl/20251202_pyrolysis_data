You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State-of-the-art advances in biotechnology for polyethylene terephthalate bio-depolymerization Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used thermoplastic material that contributes significantly to global plastic pollution. To address the pressing need to recycle fossil-derived PET and the critical importance of PET biodepolymerization and recycling technologies as promising green solutions, researchers worldwide are actively developing novel PET-degrading biocatalysts and efficient processes. The advancement of PET depolymerases and PET-degrading microorganisms is regarded as a key aspect of this study. Current studies primarily focus on the exploration, development, and enhancement of effective enzymes and strains, involving their isolation and screening from nature, along with protein design and engineering as informed by the elucidation of enzymatic mechanisms. Significant efforts have been dedicated toward process optimization to enhance the PET hydrolysis reaction. However, translating these laboratory findings into real-world applications remains a significant challenge that is contingent on the applicability of the developed biocatalysts and processes under industrial conditions. This review summarizes the cutting-edge foundational outcomes in the field of PET biodepolymerization and discusses the current challenges and potential solutions to advance PET depolymerization and, ultimately, PET recycling.
