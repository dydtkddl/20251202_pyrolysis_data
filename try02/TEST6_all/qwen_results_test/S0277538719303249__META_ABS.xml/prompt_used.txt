You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Titania surface chemistry and its influence on supported metal catalysts This work characterized the surface chemistry of a number of different titania samples including four commercial anatase samples, an anatase sample that we synthesized, the pyrogenic titania samples P25 and P90, and a commercial rutile sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS), were used to identified surface species that might interfere with the acid/base properties of the surface hydroxyls. All commercial anatase samples were contaminated by sulfur, which diminished their effectiveness as metal oxide supports for heterogeneous catalysis and has implications for their utility as photocatalysts. Hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyls remained after calcination up to 400 °C for all anatase samples, in contrast to rutile and the pyrogenic titania materials P25 and P90, in which they were eliminated. Ru(0) catalysts on titania without hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyls showed enhanced CO hydrogenolysis selectivity in the presence of water while Ru(0) catalysts on titania with hydrogen-bonded surface hydroxyls showed diminished selectivity in water, suggesting that surface hydrophilicity is important for this reaction. Heteroepitaxy between rutile RuO2 and rutile TiO2 is not essential for the creation of small evenly-spaced supported Ru(0) nanoparticles, which are important in many catalytic reactions.
