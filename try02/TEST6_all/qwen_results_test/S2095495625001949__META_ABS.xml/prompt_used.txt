You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cold plasma-assisted co-conversion of polyolefin wastes and CO2 into aromatics over hierarchical Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst Cold plasma-assisted catalytic upcycling of polyolefin wastes integrated with CO2 into value-added chemicals is a promising solution for mitigating the global carbon emissions and fossil energy crisis, but still challenging due to the complexity of products and low energy efficiency. Given this, a novel one-stage process of cold plasma coupled with Ga-modified hierarchical H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Hie-ZSM-5) catalyst for polyolefins upgrading was designed with polyolefins followed by the catalysts within the plasma region, which facilitated the upcycling of polyolefins to light olefins and CO2 activation by plasma, and thereby the enhanced synergy between cold plasma and catalysts for aromatics production. At an input power of ca. 45 W without external heating, the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste was completely converted with the assistance of CO2 and the yield of oil products over the Ga/Hie-ZSM-5 catalyst was highly up to 62.2 wt%, with nearly 100% selectivity of aromatics. Meanwhile, the degradation efficiency of LDPE and the energy efficiency could reach 2.5 gLDPE⋅gcat −1⋅h−1 and 55.56 gLDPE⋅gcat −1⋅kW−1⋅h−1, respectively. Mechanism investigation revealed that the plasma and CO2 synergistically affect the primary cracking of LDPE, forming a primary product enriched in olefins and a small amount of CO. Subsequently, the produced olefins intermediates were further aromatized via cyclization-dehydrogenation route on the Ga/Hie-ZSM-5 catalyst with assistance of CO2 under the synergistic effect of plasma-catalysis. This work offers a feasible strategy to improve the yield of aromatic products for the plasma-catalytic upcycling of polyolefins and CO2 at ambient pressure without any external heating.
