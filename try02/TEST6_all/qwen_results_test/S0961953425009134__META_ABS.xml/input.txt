Comparative evaluation of biomass and waste gasification in fixed and fluidized beds: Influence of operating conditions on syngas quality and energy viability This study evaluates the gasification of pine, olive pomace (OP), and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) in bubbling fluidized bed and fixed-bed gasifiers under varying conditions. Experiments were conducted at 700–800 °C with equivalence ratios (ER) of 0.18–0.34. For pine, H2 reached 13.75 % at 800 °C, with an LHV of 5.71 MJ/Nm3 and CGE decreasing from 68.18 % (700 °C) to 50.11 % (800 °C). OP showed higher CGE (65.09 % at 700 °C) but faced persistent tar challenges, with tar content exceeding 9 g/Nm3 even at 800 °C. RDF exhibited the highest tar production (28–30 g/Nm3) and lowest CGE (28.53 % at 800 °C), attributed to its heterogeneous composition and high ash content. Pine achieved the highest syngas flow rate (154.6 Nm3/h at 800 °C), compared to RDF (136.1 Nm3/h). These findings underscore the impact of feedstock properties and operating parameters on gasification performance, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to optimize syngas quality and reduce by-products like tar.
