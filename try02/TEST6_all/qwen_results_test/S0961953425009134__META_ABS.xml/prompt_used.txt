You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative evaluation of biomass and waste gasification in fixed and fluidized beds: Influence of operating conditions on syngas quality and energy viability This study evaluates the gasification of pine, olive pomace (OP), and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) in bubbling fluidized bed and fixed-bed gasifiers under varying conditions. Experiments were conducted at 700–800 °C with equivalence ratios (ER) of 0.18–0.34. For pine, H2 reached 13.75 % at 800 °C, with an LHV of 5.71 MJ/Nm3 and CGE decreasing from 68.18 % (700 °C) to 50.11 % (800 °C). OP showed higher CGE (65.09 % at 700 °C) but faced persistent tar challenges, with tar content exceeding 9 g/Nm3 even at 800 °C. RDF exhibited the highest tar production (28–30 g/Nm3) and lowest CGE (28.53 % at 800 °C), attributed to its heterogeneous composition and high ash content. Pine achieved the highest syngas flow rate (154.6 Nm3/h at 800 °C), compared to RDF (136.1 Nm3/h). These findings underscore the impact of feedstock properties and operating parameters on gasification performance, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to optimize syngas quality and reduce by-products like tar.
