Potential of pyrolyzed and co-pyrolyzed biomass-derived biochar for the removal of ciprofloxacin Second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (CIP) are widely used to treat bacterial infections. Solid landfill leachate, veterinary use, aquaculture, agriculture and hospital wastewater release CIP into the aquatic environment. Herein, the review discusses empirical findings related to the adsorption of CIP in wastewater using biochar, which is considered a low-cost and sustainable adsorbent. An initial ecotoxicological evaluation validated the environmental risk of CIP in the aquatic environment. The review discusses the biochar preparation by the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of various biomasses, which were subsequently used as adsorbents for removing CIP from the wastewater. The biochar derived from waste fish scales reported with a high specific surface area of 3370 m2/g. The maximum adsorption capacity for CIP employing biochar was 880.50 mg/g. The mechanisms of CIP adsorption on biochar produced by pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis that are most frequently observed are hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, pore filling, electrostatic interaction, and π-π electron donor-acceptor interaction. Langmuir and Freundlich models help to explain the CIP adsorption on biochar by providing a better fit for CIP adsorption on biochar, implying that the process involves monolayer and multilayer adsorption. Pseudo-second order kinetics best fit CIP adsorption on biochar, validating chemisorption. Biochar prepared by pyrolysis showed a range of regeneration cycles of 3–10 with good CIP removal efficiency. More research should be emphasized on post-adsorbent disposal, regeneration of co-pyrolyzed biochar, process improvement of the biochar for industrial applications and practical utilization for sustainable waste and water resource management.
