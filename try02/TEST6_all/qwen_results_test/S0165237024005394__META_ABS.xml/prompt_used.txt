You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential of pyrolyzed and co-pyrolyzed biomass-derived biochar for the removal of ciprofloxacin Second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotics like ciprofloxacin (CIP) are widely used to treat bacterial infections. Solid landfill leachate, veterinary use, aquaculture, agriculture and hospital wastewater release CIP into the aquatic environment. Herein, the review discusses empirical findings related to the adsorption of CIP in wastewater using biochar, which is considered a low-cost and sustainable adsorbent. An initial ecotoxicological evaluation validated the environmental risk of CIP in the aquatic environment. The review discusses the biochar preparation by the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of various biomasses, which were subsequently used as adsorbents for removing CIP from the wastewater. The biochar derived from waste fish scales reported with a high specific surface area of 3370 m2/g. The maximum adsorption capacity for CIP employing biochar was 880.50 mg/g. The mechanisms of CIP adsorption on biochar produced by pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis that are most frequently observed are hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, pore filling, electrostatic interaction, and π-π electron donor-acceptor interaction. Langmuir and Freundlich models help to explain the CIP adsorption on biochar by providing a better fit for CIP adsorption on biochar, implying that the process involves monolayer and multilayer adsorption. Pseudo-second order kinetics best fit CIP adsorption on biochar, validating chemisorption. Biochar prepared by pyrolysis showed a range of regeneration cycles of 3–10 with good CIP removal efficiency. More research should be emphasized on post-adsorbent disposal, regeneration of co-pyrolyzed biochar, process improvement of the biochar for industrial applications and practical utilization for sustainable waste and water resource management.
