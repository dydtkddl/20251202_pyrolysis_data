A hyper-crosslinked ionic polymer catalyzing CO2 one-pot two-step to dimethyl carbonate via HCO3 -/OH- synergy Turning CO2 waste into valuable chemicals enables a more sustainable and economically beneficial future. Especially, the two-step synthesis of linear carbonate from CO₂ has attracted significant attention. However, maintaining high activity for this two-step sequence presents a significant challenge, requiring catalysts with dual functionality for both CO2 cycloaddition and transesterification reactions. Herein, a hyper-crosslinked ionic polymer catalyst [PDCX]OH was successfully prepared by the Friedel-Crafts alkylation, quaternization and ion exchange, which simultaneously possessed rigid porous framework, nucleophilic ionic sites, and basic catalytic sites. Notably, the [PDCX]OH catalysed the one-pot two-step conversion of CO2, methanol and glycidol to dimethyl carbonate without any solvent and cocatalyst, achieving 100 % GO conversion and 45 % DMC yield. Moreover, the synergistic effects of the HCO3 -/OH- dual-active site system were studied by DFT calculations, revealing that a cooperative interaction between HCO3⁻ and OH⁻ ions enabled an efficient relay of cycloaddition followed by transesterification, thereby dramatically boosting catalytic efficiency. In this work, the bifunctional hyper-crosslinked ionic polymer catalyst [PDCX]OH was successfully designed and prepared. This catalyst possessed the dual active sites of HCO3⁻ and OH⁻, simultaneously meeting the different requirements of two reactions of CO2 cycloaddition and transesterification, achieving the synthesis of DMC in one pot two steps.
