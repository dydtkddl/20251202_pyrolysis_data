You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A hyper-crosslinked ionic polymer catalyzing CO2 one-pot two-step to dimethyl carbonate via HCO3 -/OH- synergy Turning CO2 waste into valuable chemicals enables a more sustainable and economically beneficial future. Especially, the two-step synthesis of linear carbonate from CO₂ has attracted significant attention. However, maintaining high activity for this two-step sequence presents a significant challenge, requiring catalysts with dual functionality for both CO2 cycloaddition and transesterification reactions. Herein, a hyper-crosslinked ionic polymer catalyst [PDCX]OH was successfully prepared by the Friedel-Crafts alkylation, quaternization and ion exchange, which simultaneously possessed rigid porous framework, nucleophilic ionic sites, and basic catalytic sites. Notably, the [PDCX]OH catalysed the one-pot two-step conversion of CO2, methanol and glycidol to dimethyl carbonate without any solvent and cocatalyst, achieving 100 % GO conversion and 45 % DMC yield. Moreover, the synergistic effects of the HCO3 -/OH- dual-active site system were studied by DFT calculations, revealing that a cooperative interaction between HCO3⁻ and OH⁻ ions enabled an efficient relay of cycloaddition followed by transesterification, thereby dramatically boosting catalytic efficiency. In this work, the bifunctional hyper-crosslinked ionic polymer catalyst [PDCX]OH was successfully designed and prepared. This catalyst possessed the dual active sites of HCO3⁻ and OH⁻, simultaneously meeting the different requirements of two reactions of CO2 cycloaddition and transesterification, achieving the synthesis of DMC in one pot two steps.
