Beyond the Landfill: A critical review of techniques for End-of-Life Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) valorization Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a polymer comprised of more than 50% chlorine that offers unmatched versatility at low expense. PVC is irreplaceable in several applications, such as construction materials, medical applications, and cables. This versatility and tunable properties come at the cost of complex formulations for the product and challenging end-of-life (EoL) options for PVC waste. Pure collected and sorted PVC is already recycled successfully to some extent, yet, when PVC ends up in a mixed plastic waste stream, it can be detrimental to the recycling process. PVC waste and its effects at various concentrations remain a focal point for both scholars and policymakers. In this review, the narrative begins at the naissance of PVC and continues to investigate the EoL valorization options when the products are inevitably discarded. Strategies for PVC waste recycling and the technical and legal challenges regarding each method are discussed, focusing on the European recycling market. An effective solution to handle EoL PVC requires a combination of policies and schemes for proper collection and sorting of specific waste streams and considering all available technologies to select the right tools. This review can support appropriate policies and the selection of suitable methods of recycling PVC waste.
