You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Beyond the Landfill: A critical review of techniques for End-of-Life Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) valorization Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a polymer comprised of more than 50% chlorine that offers unmatched versatility at low expense. PVC is irreplaceable in several applications, such as construction materials, medical applications, and cables. This versatility and tunable properties come at the cost of complex formulations for the product and challenging end-of-life (EoL) options for PVC waste. Pure collected and sorted PVC is already recycled successfully to some extent, yet, when PVC ends up in a mixed plastic waste stream, it can be detrimental to the recycling process. PVC waste and its effects at various concentrations remain a focal point for both scholars and policymakers. In this review, the narrative begins at the naissance of PVC and continues to investigate the EoL valorization options when the products are inevitably discarded. Strategies for PVC waste recycling and the technical and legal challenges regarding each method are discussed, focusing on the European recycling market. An effective solution to handle EoL PVC requires a combination of policies and schemes for proper collection and sorting of specific waste streams and considering all available technologies to select the right tools. This review can support appropriate policies and the selection of suitable methods of recycling PVC waste.
