You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of mixed waste plastics under different atmospheres The Thermochemical method (pyrolysis) is the most promising means to treat waste plastics, which can be converted into high value-added products with significant economic and social benefits. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of single/mixed plastics under different atmospheres (nitrogen, carbon dioxide) were explored, and two kinetic models (KAS method and Friedman method) were used to calculate the kinetic parameters. The experimental results showed that carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere can reduce the pyrolysis temperature of plastics. At the same time, the activation energy of single plastics under carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere was lower than that of nitrogen atmosphere (N2), with a decrease of about 7–60 kJ/mol, and the activation energy calculation results of mixed plastics were roughly similar. There was a positive synergistic effect between the mixed plastics under N2 atmosphere, and the activation energy decreased from 234 kJ/mol to 221 kJ/mol, with a decrease of about 6%. There was a negative synergistic effect between the mixed plastics under CO2 atmosphere, and the activation energy increased from 206 kJ/mol to 219 kJ/mol, with an increase of about 6%. The theoretical TG curve method also obtained similar conclusions. This experimental investigation can provide theoretical support for the environmentally friendly recycling technology of plastic waste.
