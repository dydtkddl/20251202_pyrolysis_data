You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis behavior of low-rank coal and high-density polyethylene over ZSM-5 via in-situ Py-TOF-MS Catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-rank coal and waste plastic is a promising method to enhance the pyrolysis products quality. In this work, the materials of Hami coal (HM), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and ZSM-5 were selected to characterize the effect of catalyst on HM and HDPE co-pyrolysis characteristics, and the catalytic co-pyrolysis mechanism was explained via in-situ Py-TOF-MS. Results demonstrate that the hydrogen radicals generated by HDPE pyrolysis interact with HM char, which accelerates the secondary cracking of HM char to form aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, resulting in the yield of coal char decreasing. Meanwhile, the hydrogen radicals react with phenoxy radicals generated from coal pyrolysis to form phenolics, such as benzenediol (m/z = 110), methyl-benzenediol (m/z = 124), and methoxy benzenemethanol. For catalyst co-pyrolysis, the yield of C2-C4 significantly increased from 9.42 to 75.21 mg/g when the ZSM-5 catalyst addition increased to 30 %. Because the ZSM-5 has a rich pore structure and abundant acid sites and promotes secondary cracking of volatiles. Furthermore, the ZSM-5 enhances phenolic compound conversion into n-alkyl benzenes as the cleavage of the C-OH bond in phenolic compounds to form aromatic hydrocarbons. These results can guide the application of ZSM-5 in the coal and waste plastic co-pyrolysis and optimal tar production.
