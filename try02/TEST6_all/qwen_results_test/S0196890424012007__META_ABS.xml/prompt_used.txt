You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical liquefaction of thermoplastic into fuel using toluene: Product distribution and behaviour The escalating accumulation of plastic waste presents a critical environmental challenge due to its resistance to degradation. Liquefaction, a thermochemical conversion process, emerges as a promising solution to convert plastic waste into valuable resources like fuel. The objective of this study was to investigate the behaviour of plastic polymer degradation in solvothermal liquefaction. This study comprehensively examines the liquefaction processes HDPE, LDPE, PS, and PP under 350–400 °C conditions and 30–90 min reaction times, using toluene as a solvent in an autoclave batch reactor. The results indicate that temperature significantly impacts liquefaction efficiency, with the following sequence: PS > PP > LDPE > HDPE. The liquefied products exhibit high heating values (HHV) of 40–44 MJ/kg, with viscosity and density comparable to gasoline and diesel. GC–MS and FTIR analyses reveal a composition rich in olefins, paraffins, and aromatics, producing carbon chain lengths from C6 to C20, aligning with conventional fuel. Finally, the mechanism of liquefaction for the polymers is proposed based on the chemical components found.
