Optimization of torrefaction parameters for coconut shell using Taguchi method: Impact on torrefaction performances, combustion characteristics, and thermal stability The torrefaction of coconut shell was optimized using the Taguchi method to assess the effects of temperature, residence time, and nitrogen flow rate on five key torrefaction indices: Higher Heating Value (HHV), Solid Yield (SY), Energy Yield (EY), Energy-Mass Co-benefit Index (EMCI), and Specific Energy Consumption (SEC). Taguchi analysis demonstrated that temperature was the primary influencing factor for all indices, while residence time and nitrogen flow rate served as secondary factors. The optimization revealed distinct optimal conditions for each index: SY (93.82 %), EY (92.24 %), and SEC (0.19 kWh/kg) reached their maximum values at lower temperatures (190 °C). In contrast, maximizing HHV (26.16 MJ/kg) required a higher torrefaction temperature of 290 °C, underscoring the need for extensive carbonization to enhance energy content. EMCI (16.66 %) was optimized at a moderate temperature of 240 °C, achieving a balance between energy density and mass reduction. FTIR, TGA, and DTG analyses confirmed that higher temperatures led to enhanced carbonization and improved thermal stability in the torrefied biomass. Combustion behavior revealed a clear trade-off: SY and EY-optimized samples decomposed more rapidly due to retained volatiles, while HHV and EMCI-optimized samples exhibited prolonged combustion with increased thermal resistance. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of the Taguchi method in tailoring torrefaction conditions to meet specific energy and material goals, advancing bioeconomy efforts by converting coconut shell waste into efficient, sustainable biofuels for diverse energy applications.
