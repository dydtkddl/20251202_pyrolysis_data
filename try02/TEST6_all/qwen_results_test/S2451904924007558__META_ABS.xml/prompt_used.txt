You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of torrefaction parameters for coconut shell using Taguchi method: Impact on torrefaction performances, combustion characteristics, and thermal stability The torrefaction of coconut shell was optimized using the Taguchi method to assess the effects of temperature, residence time, and nitrogen flow rate on five key torrefaction indices: Higher Heating Value (HHV), Solid Yield (SY), Energy Yield (EY), Energy-Mass Co-benefit Index (EMCI), and Specific Energy Consumption (SEC). Taguchi analysis demonstrated that temperature was the primary influencing factor for all indices, while residence time and nitrogen flow rate served as secondary factors. The optimization revealed distinct optimal conditions for each index: SY (93.82 %), EY (92.24 %), and SEC (0.19 kWh/kg) reached their maximum values at lower temperatures (190 °C). In contrast, maximizing HHV (26.16 MJ/kg) required a higher torrefaction temperature of 290 °C, underscoring the need for extensive carbonization to enhance energy content. EMCI (16.66 %) was optimized at a moderate temperature of 240 °C, achieving a balance between energy density and mass reduction. FTIR, TGA, and DTG analyses confirmed that higher temperatures led to enhanced carbonization and improved thermal stability in the torrefied biomass. Combustion behavior revealed a clear trade-off: SY and EY-optimized samples decomposed more rapidly due to retained volatiles, while HHV and EMCI-optimized samples exhibited prolonged combustion with increased thermal resistance. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of the Taguchi method in tailoring torrefaction conditions to meet specific energy and material goals, advancing bioeconomy efforts by converting coconut shell waste into efficient, sustainable biofuels for diverse energy applications.
