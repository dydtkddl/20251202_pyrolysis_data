You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects in the copyrolysis of municipal sewage sludge digestate and salix: Reaction mechanism, product characterization and char stability Anaerobic digestion is a practical process for recovering energy and materials from sewage sludge. However, land disposal of the derived digestate results in environmental problems, such as eutrophication and salinization. Copyrolysis of sewage sludge digestate and lignocellulosic biomass produces a high-quality oil, a diluted hazardous component of biochar. This study investigates the copyrolysis behavior of lignocellulosic biomass and sludge digestate with different blending ratios using bench-scale experiments. Compared to individual feedstock pyrolysis, copyrolysis shows a higher energy distribution in the liquid product and a lower energy distribution in the char and gas product. The highest energy yield with respect to the organic fraction of liquid product is observed in the copyrolysis case, corresponding to 36.4% of the total energy in the feedstock. The interaction between the sludge digestate and lignocellulosic biomass is studied through product characterizations, mechanistic investigations and char stability assessments. The liquid products in the copyrolysis cases show a relatively high abundance of esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, pyridines and pyrroles. The reaction pathways of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates are investigated. Two synergistic reaction pathways are proposed. The char stability and nitrogen distribution are investigated. According to the results, the synergistic interaction between feedstocks enhances the quality and energy yield of the liquid biofuel. The char product from copyrolysis has higher potential for use as a carbon sink and fertilizer.
