Catalytic cracking of carinata oil for hydrocarbon biofuel over fresh and regenerated Zn/Na-ZSM-5 Catalytic cracking of carinata oil over fresh and regenerated Zn/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor at 450°C was carried out to produce hydrocarbon biofuel. The effect of the fresh and regenerated Zn/Na-ZSM-5 on the hydrocarbon biofuel’s quality and yield was discussed. Characterization of the catalyst, hydrocarbon biofuel and gas were carried out. The hydrocarbon biofuel yield obtained over regenerated Zn/Na-ZSM-5 increased but the coke yield and distillation residual yield decreased, compared to fresh Zn/Na-ZSM-5. The regeneration of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 had a minor influence on the density of the hydrocarbon biofuel, but the higher heating value (HHV) decreased, and the viscosity and acid value increased over regenerated Zn/Na-ZSM-5. The regeneration of Zn/Na-ZSM-5 reduced the decarboxylation, decarbonylation and dehydrogenation of carinata oil, which caused the lower content of CO2, CO, H2 and light hydrocarbons (C1–C5). A preliminary test of the distillation residual mixture upgrading over fresh Zn/Na-ZSM-5 was performed, suggesting that the distillation residual mixture could be recycled for further upgrading. The produced gas including H2, CO and light hydrocarbons might be reused as syngas for ether power generation or production of value chemicals.
