High performance nuclear thermal propulsion system for near term exploration missions to 100 A.U. and beyond A new compact ultra light nuclear reactor engine design termed MITEE (MIniature Reac Tor EnginE) is described. MITEE heats hydrogen propellant to 3000 K, achieving a specific impulse of 1000 seconds and a thrust-to-weight of 10. Total engine mass is 200 kg, including reactor, pump, auxiliaries and a 30% contingency. MITEE enables many types of new and unique missions to the outer solar system not possible with chemical engines. Examples include missions to 100 A.U. in less than 10 years, flybys of Pluto in 5 years, sample return from Pluto and the moons of the outer planets, unlimited ramjet flight in planetary atmospheres, etc. Much of the necessary technology for MITEE already exists as a result of previous nuclear rocket development programs. With some additional development, initial MITEE missions could begin in only 6 years.
