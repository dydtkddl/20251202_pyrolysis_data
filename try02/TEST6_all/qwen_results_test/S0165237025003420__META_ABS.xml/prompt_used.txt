You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-temperature pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene for hydrogen production and carbon capture Utilizing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as a feedstock, non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis represents a promising technology for large-scale hydrogen generation and carbon capture. Furthermore, the use of the solid carbon byproduct generated during the process, enhances the operation’s economic feasibility. This work uses the model compound to reveal the potential of LDPE pyrolysis for producing hydrogen and capturing carbon. A laboratory-scale high-temperature fixed bed reactor is operated in the temperature ranging from 700 °C to 1600 °C, with LDPE pellets of 5 mm in diameter. Despite a decrease in gas yield to 13.7 wt% as the temperature increases, the hydrogen yield significantly increased up to 11.0 wt% from 900 °C to 1600 °C. Approximately two-thirds of the hydrogen present in the polymer was identified as molecular hydrogen in the product gas. At 1600 °C, a purity of 98.5 mol% was achieved for the hydrogen produced, while the product gas at temperatures ranging from 700 °C to 900 °C predominantly contained methane and ethylene. The analysis of the influence of temperature on the condensable product phase demonstrated an increase in the yields of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) species up to a temperature of 1000 °C. The decrease in yield of Aliphatic and PAHs from 1000 °C onwards could be attributed to the gradual decarbonization of the gas phase through the formation of solid carbon. Additionally, the produced solid carbon was analyzed using various techniques, including TEM, SEM, DLS, TGA, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated its potential as a sustainable industrial carbon material.
