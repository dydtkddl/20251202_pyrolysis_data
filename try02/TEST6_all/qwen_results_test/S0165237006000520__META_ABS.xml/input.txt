Catalytic and thermal oxidative pyrolysis of LDPE in a continuous reactor system In this work, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic which is a mager product within plastics and formed a high amount of waste was chosen as a material to be worked. LDPE was both decomposed thermally and catalytic in a continuous reactor via as an oxidative media. Catalytic and thermal processes were investigated at the temperature range of 400–500°C and raw material feeding at a rate of 0.7gmin−1. As a result of degradation, the maximum liquid yield, acid and peroxid numbers of liquid products in thermal and catalytic oxidative media at 400°C temperature and 600mLmin−1 air flow rate conditions have determined as 102%, 28, 52 and 75%, 16 and 43, respectively. In addition, the molecular weight of liquid products were determined by GC/MS system and found that oxygenic compounds for thermal and catalytic oxidative pyrolysis aproximately 50 and 27%, respectively.
