You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

De-NOx process in the presence of CO on perovskites La-Ni-O supported on AI2O3 and ZrO2 The reaction of NO elimination in the presence of equimolecular amount of CO was investigated on lanthanum nickelate perovskite species supported either on Al2O3 or ZrO2. The support was pretreated with lanthana whose presence was necessary for the development of a LaNiO3 perovskite phase on alumina. On the contrary the phase developed on the zirconia based solids was La2NiO4. The solids based on alumina possess a specific surface area of 35–65 m22g−1 while those based on zirconia 3–7 m2g−1. The La2NiO4/ZrO2 solids are more active for the NO elimination as compared to LaNiO3/Al2O3 ones, irrespectively if the activity is calculated per unit mass or unit area of the solids. The smaller activity of LaNiO 3/Al2O3 is attributed to the stronger adsorption of NO on the NI+3 catalytic centers which result in an 25–30% excess conversion of NO as compared to CO. On the La2NiO4/ZrO2 solids the conversion of NO does not exceeds 12–14% that of CO, the excess of NO in both cases suffering disproportionation towards N2O. The comparison between the behaviour of supported perovskites on ZrO2 with that of the pure solids Indicates that ZrO2 acts most probably synergistically in boosting the activity of La2NiO4.
