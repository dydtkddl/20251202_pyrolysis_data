Investigation on hydrogen-rich syngas production from catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and waste paper blends Urgent need for waste disposal and renewable energy have opened up promising pathways for renewable and sustainable fuel production to substitute traditional fossil fuels. In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste paper (WP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as typical municipal solid wastes was experimentally investigated towards hydrogen-rich syngas production. Results indicated the maximum H2 yield (429 μmol·gcat −1·min−1) was obtained with 60% PVC weight ratio under 900 °C which was higher than single component pyrolysis. Higher hydrogen yield (681.76 μmol·gcat −1·min−1) appeared over Fe/CeO2–CaO under the optimal conditions compared to that of Ru/ZSM-5-CaO (445.54 μmol·gcat −1·min−1). From the calculated non-isothermal kinetic parameters, both catalysts could reduce activation energies. Proper porous structure and CaO content in the catalyst could enhance hydrogen production via carbon species fixation.
