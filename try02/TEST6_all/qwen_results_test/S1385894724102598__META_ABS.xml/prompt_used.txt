You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interaction mechanisms of coal macerals during pyrolysis: Insights from TG and Py-GC/MS experiments combined with ReaxFF MD simulations The mechanisms of interaction among coal macerals during pyrolysis processes remain uncertain. This study investigates the interactions between vitrinite and inertinite in three Chinese coals of varying ranks using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations. Experimental results show that the interactions between vitrinite and inertinite consistently inhibit volatile matter release and increase pyrolysis activation energy across different coal types and mixing ratios. Furthermore, these interactions reduce the yield of polycyclic aromatic compounds while promoting the formation of light volatiles. ReaxFF MD simulations further reveal that the interactions between vitrinite and inertinite significantly enhance polycondensation reactions. The key mechanism involves larger inertinite molecules possessing numerous and persistent binding sites due to steric hindrance. These molecules can fix substantial amounts of smaller vitrinite fragments, particularly polycyclic aromatic molecules, resulting in reduced aromatic product yields. Further analysis reveals that interaction strength decreases with increasing coal rank. At equivalent coal ranks, the 1:1 mixing ratio exhibits stronger interactions compared to other ratios. Additionally, different mixing ratios demonstrate distinct interaction patterns across various temperature ranges. Subsequently, an interaction strength index and a comprehensive coal property index were developed for quantitative characterization. The results show a good positive correlation between the two indices, establishing that interaction strength is fundamentally governed by both coal rank and structural heterogeneity. This study provides new insights into complex coal pyrolysis mechanisms and offers valuable guidance for optimizing industrial pyrolysis processes.
