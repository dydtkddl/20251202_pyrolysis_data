A comprehensive evaluation of synthesis methods for porous carbon materials and their applications in energy storage Porous carbon materials have emerged as a promising class of materials for energy storage applications due to their unique properties, including high surface area, tuneable pore structure and excellent electrical conductivity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the various synthesis methods employed to produce the porous carbon materials, with a focus on their potential applications in energy storage devices. The intricacies of various synthesis techniques such as physical, chemical activation, template-based methods and direct carbonization were summarized. Development of eco-friendly porous carbon materials suing safe chemical activators is crucial. Over the past few years, chemical activation agents have been produced, but some of them are extremely corrosive and even hazardous. For the development of supercapacitors (SCs), porous carbons lacking microporous features were generated using novel chemical activation agents are of particular interest. Direct pyrolysis of self-template organic salts may be a method for formation of porous carbons for SCs, although the resulting porous carbons have a low tap density because of their macroporous architectures, which can be increased by crushing them. Pseudocapacitive components in aqueous SCs may be supported by self-templated carbons with opening 3D macroporous structures. To enhance the quality of porous carbons for energy storage applications, various techniques have recently been developed, including the pyrolysis of conjugated copolymers, block copolymers. Furthermore, the impact of synthesis parameters, activation agent, temperature and time on the resulting pore structure was discussed. By highlighting the latest advancements and future perspectives, this work aims to stimulate further research and innovation in the field of energy storage.
