You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive evaluation of synthesis methods for porous carbon materials and their applications in energy storage Porous carbon materials have emerged as a promising class of materials for energy storage applications due to their unique properties, including high surface area, tuneable pore structure and excellent electrical conductivity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the various synthesis methods employed to produce the porous carbon materials, with a focus on their potential applications in energy storage devices. The intricacies of various synthesis techniques such as physical, chemical activation, template-based methods and direct carbonization were summarized. Development of eco-friendly porous carbon materials suing safe chemical activators is crucial. Over the past few years, chemical activation agents have been produced, but some of them are extremely corrosive and even hazardous. For the development of supercapacitors (SCs), porous carbons lacking microporous features were generated using novel chemical activation agents are of particular interest. Direct pyrolysis of self-template organic salts may be a method for formation of porous carbons for SCs, although the resulting porous carbons have a low tap density because of their macroporous architectures, which can be increased by crushing them. Pseudocapacitive components in aqueous SCs may be supported by self-templated carbons with opening 3D macroporous structures. To enhance the quality of porous carbons for energy storage applications, various techniques have recently been developed, including the pyrolysis of conjugated copolymers, block copolymers. Furthermore, the impact of synthesis parameters, activation agent, temperature and time on the resulting pore structure was discussed. By highlighting the latest advancements and future perspectives, this work aims to stimulate further research and innovation in the field of energy storage.
