You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A predictive model for biomass waste pyrolysis yield: Exploring the correlation of proximate analysis and product composition This paper presents the outcomes of a comprehensive factorial experiment designed to explore the intricate dynamics of volatile content (ranging from 58 % to 76 %), temperature (ranging from 350 °C to 750 °C), and heating rate (ranging from 5 °C/min to 10 °C/min) on the yields of bio-oil, char, and gas in biomass pyrolysis processes. Through systematic analysis utilizing date stones, spent coffee grounds, and cow manure, significant variations in response variables are unveiled, with the main pyrolysis product of bio-oil yields spanning from 28 % to 61 %, char yields ranging between 23 % and 55 %, and gas yields fluctuating from 6 % to 42 %. In-depth examination of bio-oil compositions (based on carbon number classifications, and bonding arrangements) and gas composition (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane) at varying operating conditions elucidates substantial yield differences, emphasizing the nuanced nature of product compositions. Furthermore, advanced statistical techniques, including response surface methodology (RSM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA), reveal and confirm complex interaction patterns among the experimental factors. Results indicate that bio-oil, char, and bio-oil composition, including C2-C3 compounds, C4-C10 compounds, ≥C11 compounds, and aromatics yield, are significantly influenced by the volatiles content and reaction temperature of the feedstock. The paper presents empirical equations offering valuable predictive insights into optimizing product outcomes. Validation studies comparing experimental and predicted yields of ternary biomass feeds highlight the robustness of the proposed models. Additionally, optimization efforts utilizing desirability criteria underscore the multifaceted nature of yield optimization, with tailored conditions demonstrating remarkable success in maximizing desired products while minimizing undesired byproducts. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between process parameters and product yields in biomass pyrolysis, offering valuable insights for process optimization and sustainable resource utilization.
