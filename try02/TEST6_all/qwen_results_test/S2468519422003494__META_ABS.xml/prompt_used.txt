You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on recent progress and reactor set-ups for hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition Hydrogen is a clean and efficient energy carrier, and a hydrogen-based economy is an alternative solution for sustainability. The present work reviews the recent progress for hydrogen's production from various technologies including the generation from fossil fuels, from biomass through biological and thermochemical processes and from water splitting. Although hydrogen is a zero-emission energy when it is used, its cleanness depends on the production pathway that preceded. Hydrogen's storage and transportation has been costly and an unsafe procedure; formic acid (FA; CH2O2), on the other hand, can be generated, transported, and decomposed easily to hydrogen. Formic acid is generated from the hydrogenation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and can easily be provided with energy portable devices, vehicles, and other applications. In addition, the most widely known homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and reactors for the formic acid reaction are presented. Different types of reactors like, fixed-bed reactors (FBRs), batch reactors, continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and microreactors were assessed for their performance and reaction's efficiency during formic acid’s decomposition.
