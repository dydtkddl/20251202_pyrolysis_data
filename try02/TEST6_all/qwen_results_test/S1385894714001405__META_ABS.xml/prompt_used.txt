You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

VOCs removal by adsorption onto activated carbons from biocollagenic wastes of vegetable tanning The objective of this work was to obtain low-cost adsorbent materials in order to remove VOC pollutants. Toluene was chosen as a model of volatile organic compounds for this study. Microporous activated carbons were obtained from vegetable-tanned leather wastes (shavings, trimmings and buffing dust) by means of chemical activation with alkaline agents (KOH, NaOH and K2CO3). A specific BET surface area, total pore volume (VTOT ) and total micropore volume (Vtot ) of 2719m2 g−1, 1.184cm3 g−1 and 0.829cm3 g−1, respectively, were obtained by KOH-activation, whereas K2CO3-activation yielded values of 1645m2 g−1, 0.712cm3 g−1 and 0.536cm3 g−1, respectively. Low-cost activated carbons with textural properties, chemical functional groups and a capacity for toluene adsorption comparable to that of activated carbons obtained with KOH or NaOH were produced from these wastes by means of K2CO3 chemical activation. Toluene adsorption values at concentrations on the odour threshold-5ppm (27mg VOC/g), TLV-TWA-50ppm (288mgVOC/g) or TLC-C-100ppm (700mgVOC/g) higher than commercial activated carbons such as NORIT RB3, WV-A1100 or Centaur HSV were obtained.
