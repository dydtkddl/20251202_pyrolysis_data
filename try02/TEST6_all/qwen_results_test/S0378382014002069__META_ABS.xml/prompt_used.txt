You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic gasification of glucose to H2 in supercritical water Gasification of glucose in supercritical water with and without catalysts (NaOH and Ni based) was investigated at 400°C and 500°C with a residence time of 30min. The products from glucose gasification without catalyst consist of ~8–17wt.% gas, 21–24wt.% solid, 9–16wt.% acetone phase and 8–10wt.% water phase. As expected, all the gas product yields increased by an increase in process temperature and higher water to biomass ratio benefits the yields of gas phase and water phase. For the experimental runs with catalysts, NaOH had the best activity for improving H2 formation, the H2 yield increased by 135% with NaOH compared to that for run without catalyst at 500°C with water to biomass ratio of 3. At the same operating conditions, the presence of Ni/activated carbon (AC) contributed to 81% increase in H2 yield, followed by 62% with Ni/MgO, 60% with Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 and 52% with Ni/Al2O3. The net effect of Ni was studied by using activated carbon and Ni/AC at 500°C with water to biomass ratio of 7 for 30min. The results showed that the hydrogen production was further increased by 6.9% with activated carbon and 36.9% with Ni/AC.
