Upgrading of sisal-derived bio-oil employing platinum-supported hierarchical HZSM-5 derived from coal fly ash silica This study evaluates sisal residue-derived bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using platinum-impregnated, hierarchically structured HZSM-5 zeolites synthesized from coal fly ash silica. The silica extraction achieved a 35 wt% yield with 97 % purity. Zeolites were hierarchized via desilication (0.05–0.20 M NaOH) and loaded with 1 wt% Pt. The HZ05Pt catalyst (moderate desilication) exhibited superior performance, increasing hydrocarbon yield to 68.8 %, with enhanced selectivity for C9–C12 (15.89 %) and C13–C20 (30.86 %) fractions, and reducing oxygen content to 14.26 wt% (O/C = 0.15). In contrast, excessive desilication (HZ20Pt) led to reduced activity and higher oxygen retention (25.03 wt%), indicating structural degradation. Nitrogen-containing compounds remained largely unconverted, suggesting limited hydrodenitrogenation. The results highlight the synergistic effect of moderate hierarchization and platinum incorporation in producing stable, energy-dense biofuels. Additionally, using coal fly ash as a silica source reinforces the process's sustainability and circular economy potential.
