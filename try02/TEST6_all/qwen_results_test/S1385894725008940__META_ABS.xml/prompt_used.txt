You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient microplastic removal in aquatic environments using iron–nitrogen co-doped layered biocarbon materials Microplastics (MPs), as an emerging pollutant, are widely distributed in water environments and pose considerable environmental and health threats due to their chemical inertness and the toxicity of attached substances. The development of high-efficient and facile adsorbents for MPs removal is of significance. Hence, this study proposed an innovative iron–nitrogen co-doped layered adsorbent derived from glucose via molten salt-assisted pyrolysis. The presence of molten salt promoted the formation of layered structures, providing micron-scale channels for the entrapment of MPs from water. Loading iron alone enhanced electrostatic adsorption between MPs and carbon materials; however, excessive dosage clogged the channel structure. This can be solved by co-doping nitrogen, which facilitated uniform iron dispersion. The co-doped layered adsorbent with iron loading at 1.43 % achieved a removal efficiency of 96.5 % and capacity of 148.39 mg·g−1 for polystyrene (PS) MPs amid low plastic concentration and adsorbent dosage. It also exhibited efficient removal for a wide pH range and high salinity solution, maintaining over 90 % efficiency after multiple cycles. Kinetic analysis revealed a combined physical and chemical adsorption mechanism. The molten salt-assisted synthesis combined with iron–nitrogen co-doping offers a promising, scalable solution for MPs pollution control, paving the way for the development of highly efficient and reusable adsorbents with enhanced performance in environmental remediation.
