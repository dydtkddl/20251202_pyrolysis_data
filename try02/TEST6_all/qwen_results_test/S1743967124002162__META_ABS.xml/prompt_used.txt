You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene: Degradation behaviors, kinetics, and product characteristics Pyrolysis is a promising technology for converting plastic waste into valuable raw materials while offering a potential solution to the global plastic pollution crisis. In this study, the thermal pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is investigated in a drop tube reactor under nearly isothermal conditions. The impact of reaction temperature and gas/volatile residence time on carbon conversion and product distribution is examined across a range of 500–900 °C and 3.6–32.2 s, respectively. Non-condensable gas products detected by online mass spectrometry are H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8. At elevated temperatures and prolonged residence time, H2 yield reaches as high as 8.6 wt% of the initial HDPE mass due to intensified cracking reactions of C2–C3 hydrocarbons and long-chain aliphatic compounds. Consequently, pyrolysis tars consist mainly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 5–7 rings, accompanied by visible coke deposition within the reactor. HDPE decomposition to volatiles is an endothermic process and it is complete at a temperature between 492 °C and 525 °C, depending on the heating rate employed, from non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) measurements. The thermal degradation of HDPE pellets follows the two-dimensional nucleation growth model for conversion levels up to 0.8 with an apparent activation energy of 259–270 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 4.83 × 1017–1.37 × 1019 min−1, determined from various isoconversional methods such as Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), and Starink, along with Criado's master plots. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing process parameters and refining reactor design for pyrolysis, which can be integrated with gasification and reforming processes to enhance hydrogen production on a larger scale.
