You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic upgrading of polyethylene plastic waste using GMOF catalyst: Morphology, pyrolysis, and product analysis Since 2000, global plastic waste production and consumption have doubled, escalating from 250 to 500 million tonnes. Merely 9 % of plastic waste undergoes global recycling, leaving the majority either in landfills or poorly managed. This research introduces a new catalyst, GMOF, created by growing Metal-Organic Framework (MOFs) rods on the flaked, carpet-like structure of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanosheets. The aim is to enhance the quality of pyrolysis products derived from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste using this GMOF catalyst. HDPE and LDPE, sourced from post-consumer plastic packaging, underwent specific treatment involving cleaning, drying, and shredding. Morphological and property evaluations of GO nanosheets before and after MOF decoration employed techniques including Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Flash pyrolysis at 500 °C for 1 min using a sample-to-catalyst ratio of 4:1 in a Quartz Wool Matrix (QWM) reactor was conducted via a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Frontier LAB pyrolizers. Thermal stability and characteristics of feedstocks and catalysts were assessed using TGA. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) analyzed and quantified pyrolysis product compounds, while a Micro GC Fusion system determined non-condensable pyrolyzate permanent gas distribution. Results showcased that the GMOF catalyst's unique morphology efficiently captured smaller radicals on its surface, providing increased surface area for effective radical–radical interactions during pyrolysis. In HDPE pyrolysis, the GMOF catalyst notably decreased selectivity of C21-C40 and C40 + wax fractions to 49.07 % and 7.73 %, respectively, while boosting C1-C20 olefin production by 2.54 %. Conversely, LDPE pyrolysis with the GMOF catalyst notably amplified the CO2 peak intensity by 3.17 %, signifying a gasification phase. Primary gases produced were C3 aliphatic hydrocarbons, propane, and propylene, yielding 79.46 % collectively.
