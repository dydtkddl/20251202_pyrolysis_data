You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrotreating atmospheric gasoil and co-processing with rapeseed oil using supported Ni-Mo and Co-Mo carbide catalysts Sulfur-free Mo carbide catalysts supported on Al2O3 and TiO2 have shown good activity during the co-processing of middle distillates with vegetable oils in prior studies. However, their hydrotreating activity is low compared with that of conventional hydrotreating catalysts. To increase the hydrotreating effectiveness, promoter metals, such as Ni or Co, can be added. This paper describes an extensive study on the use of four sulfur-free Ni-Mo and Co-Mo carbide catalysts (supported on Al2O3 and TiO2) for the hydrotreatment of atmospheric gasoil (AGO) and co-processing with rapeseed oil (RSO). The tests were conducted in a fixed bed reactor unit at 330–350 °C, 5.5 MPa, a weigh hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 1–2 h−1, and AGO/RSO of 100/0, 95/5, 90/10, and 75/25 wt.%. Analogous to conventional hydrotreatment catalysts, adding the promotor metals significantly increased the product quality and the hydrodesulfurisation and hydrodenitrogenation efficiencies at higher temperatures or at lower WHSVs. In the case of RSO co-processing, all the tested catalysts promoted the hydrodeoxygenation pathway instead of (hydro)decarboxylation/decarbonylation with an insignificant decrease in the hydrodesulfurization efficiency at lower AGO/RSO ratios. Therefore, our results suggest that promoting Mo carbide catalysts with Ni or Co significantly improves their catalytic properties, making them more competitive with conventional hydrotreating catalysts.
