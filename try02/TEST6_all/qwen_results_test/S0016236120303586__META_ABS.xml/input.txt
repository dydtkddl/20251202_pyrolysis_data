Hydrotreating atmospheric gasoil and co-processing with rapeseed oil using supported Ni-Mo and Co-Mo carbide catalysts Sulfur-free Mo carbide catalysts supported on Al2O3 and TiO2 have shown good activity during the co-processing of middle distillates with vegetable oils in prior studies. However, their hydrotreating activity is low compared with that of conventional hydrotreating catalysts. To increase the hydrotreating effectiveness, promoter metals, such as Ni or Co, can be added. This paper describes an extensive study on the use of four sulfur-free Ni-Mo and Co-Mo carbide catalysts (supported on Al2O3 and TiO2) for the hydrotreatment of atmospheric gasoil (AGO) and co-processing with rapeseed oil (RSO). The tests were conducted in a fixed bed reactor unit at 330–350 °C, 5.5 MPa, a weigh hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 1–2 h−1, and AGO/RSO of 100/0, 95/5, 90/10, and 75/25 wt.%. Analogous to conventional hydrotreatment catalysts, adding the promotor metals significantly increased the product quality and the hydrodesulfurisation and hydrodenitrogenation efficiencies at higher temperatures or at lower WHSVs. In the case of RSO co-processing, all the tested catalysts promoted the hydrodeoxygenation pathway instead of (hydro)decarboxylation/decarbonylation with an insignificant decrease in the hydrodesulfurization efficiency at lower AGO/RSO ratios. Therefore, our results suggest that promoting Mo carbide catalysts with Ni or Co significantly improves their catalytic properties, making them more competitive with conventional hydrotreating catalysts.
