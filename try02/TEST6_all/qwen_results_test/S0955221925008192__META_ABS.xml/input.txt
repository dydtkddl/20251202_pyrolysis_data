Supercritical CO₂ debinding: A promising method for binder removal in ceramic fabrication with potential applications in additive manufacturing- a review Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO₂) has emerged as a promising tool for binder removal in ceramic manufacturing, particularly for addressing challenges in additive manufacturing (AM) of complex geometries and thick-walled parts. Its unique combination of gas-like diffusivity and liquid-like density enables efficient binder extraction, reducing processing times and minimizing defects compared to traditional thermal or solvent-based methods. This review evaluates the properties, mechanisms, and applications of scCO₂ in ceramic binder removal, highlighting its ability to dissolve and transport organic binders through solubilization, diffusion, and capillary flow. Various process parameters such as pressure, temperature, and co-solvent integration are analyzed for their impact on extraction efficiency. Additionally, advancements in scCO₂ instrumentation and the integration of mathematical models to predict binder removal dynamics are discussed. The paper also identifies gaps in research, including limited studies on scCO₂ pre-debinding for thick and intricate ceramic parts, and proposes directions for future work aimed at optimizing the scalability and sustainability of scCO₂-based processes in ceramic AM.
