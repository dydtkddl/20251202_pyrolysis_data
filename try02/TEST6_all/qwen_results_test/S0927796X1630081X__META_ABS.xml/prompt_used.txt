You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanostructured transparent conductive films: Fabrication, characterization and applications Commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) has several drawbacks for optoelectronic applications such as high cost due to indium scarcity and high temperature deposition process, mechanical brittleness, and the complicated manufacturing process where lithographic patterning is needed. Its brittle nature can lead to cracking when used in applications involving bending, such as touch screens and flexible displays. Therefore, novel transparent conducting films (TCFs) based on nanomaterials with a similar or improved optoelectronic performance and good mechanical flexibility are needed for next-generation stretchable and wearable devices. Carbon nanotubes, graphene and metallic nanowires have been explored as alternatives, and they show great promise for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications. In particular, graphene films have a higher transmittance over a wider wavelength range than single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films. For equivalent sheet resistance, the graphene films exhibit optical transmittance comparable to that of ITO in visible wavelength, but far superior transmittance in infrared spectral region. This article provides the state-of-the-art reviews on the synthesis, optoelectronic properties, applications and challenges of these nanostructured materials for fabricating TCFs.
