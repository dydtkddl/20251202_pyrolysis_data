You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vacuum pyrolysis of commingled plastics containing PVC II. Product analysis Vacuum pyrolysis of individual plastics including high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) has been performed at a final temperature of 500°C and under a total pressure of 2 kPa. A PVC sample and a commingled plastic sample composed of HDPE/LDPE/PP/PS/PVC have been pyrolyzed in two consecutive steps at 360 and 520°C in order to separately trap HCl. A pyrolysis set-up consisting of a bench scale batch reactor with a condensation train was used to collect the pyrolysis products. The main gaseous and liquid products, including the chlorinated hydrocarbons, were identified by chromatography. Global and chlorine mass balances were performed. The yields and pyrolysis product composition from each single polymer were compared with those from the commingled plastics. At 520°C, 99.55 wt.% of the total chlorine was trapped as HCl corresponding to 4.6 wt.% in yield, on an original feedstock basis, followed by 62.0 wt.% wax, 31.1 wt.% oil, 1.0 wt.% gas and 1.2 wt.% solid char residue (loss was 0.1 wt.%). The pyrolysis oil contained 12 ppm Cl on a pyrolysis oil basis. This value was less than what was expected (153 ppm) from the theoretical values which were calculated when the individual polymers were pyrolysed. The chlorinated hydrocarbons formed during the pyrolysis of commingled plastics were different from those obtained during the thermal decomposition of pure PVC. However, the hydrocarbons produced in the oil fraction were similar to those identified during the pyrolysis of the single plastics.
