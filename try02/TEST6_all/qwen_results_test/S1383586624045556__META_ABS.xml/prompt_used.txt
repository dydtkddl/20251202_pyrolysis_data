You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Critical review of the green comprehensive utilization of NMFs-WPCBs: Efficient separation and clean recovery of bromine resources Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs), rich in toxic organic halides and high-value metals, are critical electronic waste (e-waste) components. However, the comprehensive utilization of WPCBs has become challenging due to the complex composition, low value and secondary pollution of its non-metallic fractions (NMFs). Therefore, achieving the harmless treatment of NMFs-WPCBs and the upgraded reuse of bromine resources not only reduces the consumption of natural resources and environment pollution but also facilitates the high-value recovery of non-metallic resources, thereby providing new opportunities for sustainable development. This review systematically analyzes the latest research advancements concerning debromination processes for NMFs-WPCBs. Firstly, the composition and associated hazards of NMFs-WPCBs are briefly discussed. Secondly, the highly promising debromination processes developed in recent years for NMFs-WPCBs are evaluated. The debromination methods for NMFs, including mechanochemical technology, supercritical fluid technology, and pyrolysis technology, are summarized in detail. The mechanism of ball milling debromination and the decomposition and transformation of organic bromides in supercritical technology are summarized and analyzed. Furthermore, the debromination effects and catalytic mechanisms of additives in the pyrolysis process are analyzed and compared. Eventually, based on the advantages of the above debromination processes and the migration and solidification mechanism of bromine elements in the pyrolysis process of organic bromides, an integrated and efficient debromination process for the diversified recovery of NMFs-WPCBs was proposed to selectively obtain high-value target products and achieve directional control of bromine, which provides a sustainable pathway for the harmless treatment of NMFs-WPCBs and upgrading and reutilizing of bromine elements. This review is intended to provide a reference for achieving ecologically sustainable development and promoting the high-value utilization of non-metallic resources in WPCBs.
