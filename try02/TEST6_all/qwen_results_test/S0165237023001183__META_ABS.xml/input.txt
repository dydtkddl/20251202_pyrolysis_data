Maximizing the production of high-value chemicals via fast-pyrolysis of lignin-engineered poplars: Impact of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (hpCAD) downregulation Lignin valorisation is crucial for the economic viability of biorefineries, but remains a challenge. Our work shows that the fast pyrolysis of transgenic biomass has significant potential for the production of high-value chemicals. New field-grown transgenic poplars severely downregulated for cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (hpCAD) have a change in lignin structure due to the substantial incorporation of sinapaldehyde into the polymer. Wild-type and hpCAD poplars were pyrolyzed in a micropyrolyzer for identification and quantification of pyrolytic volatiles. The study aims at capturing the influence of CAD1 downregulation on lignin-derived pyrolysis products supported by statistical analysis of the obtained pyrolysis data. The results showed that the pyrolysis of hpCAD lines enhanced the yield of two kinds of high-value aromatics, namely, those with CO group in side-chains (e.g. vanillin and syringaldehyde), and those without side-chains (e.g. phenol, guaiacol and syringol), at the expense of the formation of aromatics with alkyl side-chains.
