You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of sustainable thermoplastic jute prepregs by emulsion impregnation for biocomposites The use of thermoplastic composites reinforced with plant fibers has been in high demand due to their lightweight, recyclability and sustainability. However, conventional composite manufacturing processes are incompatible with natural fibers to get the desired impregnation level with thermoplastic matrices. There is a need to develop a sustainable, economical pre-impregnation method for better resin dispersion, extended shelf life, and faster production. This study aims to investigate a method for producing thermoplastic emulsion and its processing with plant fibers. Prepregs were fabricated using jute yarn and emulsion to prepare biocomposites via compression molding. These biocomposites were fabricated with six stacking sequences (A0450, A904590, A459045, A45045, A0900, and A90090). The mechanical performance of these composites showed strong dependence on the stacking sequence. The results revealed that the highest tensile strength of 17.02 MPa was exhibited by A0450, while a reduction of 94 % and 91 % in tensile strength was observed for laminates A459045 (1.55 MPa) and A904590 (1.01 MPa), respectively. The results of the short beam test showed a similar trend with no interlaminar failure. The inherent ductile nature of the matrix resulted in a rebound during a drop-weight test, and A0450 and A90090 showed the maximum load-bearing properties. The composites produced showed proper fiber impregnation and perfect interfacial adhesion, thus overcoming the limitations associated with traditional thermoplastic matrices. Further optimization of the developed acrylic emulsion could emerge as a potential substitute for conventional thermoplastics for the development of sustainable composites.
