You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate from waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) catalyzed by tin catalysts The production scale and usage of plastics have generated significant amounts of waste especially in regards of PET which is one of the widely produced polymer worldwide, whose accumulation in the environment has become an issue despite attempts to increase its recycling rate. Herein, we applied a new group of catalysts based on organotin compounds for the depolymerization of PET waste. The obtained results showed the formation of dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), which is a commonly produced plasticizer. For this purpose, a number of organotin catalysts, including tin (II) oxalate, tin (II) bis(2-ethylhexanoate), monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexanoate), dibutyltin oxide, and dioctyltin oxide (V) were tested. Additionally, common transesterification catalysts, such as zinc acetate and potassium hydroxide, were applied and proved less effective than the tested organotin compounds. Our results showed that among tested compounds monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexanoate) was the most effective catalyst. Taking into account its good properties an application sample of plasticizer was synthesized on a large scale using monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexanoate). Furthermore, the physio-chemical and plasticizing properties were determined for two types of plasticizer samples (purified and unpurified). These properties were compared with commercial DOTP, where both plasticizers had similar plasticizing properties towards PVC
