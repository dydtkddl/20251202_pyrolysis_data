Gas phase alkylation of biomass-derived m-cresol with iso-propanol over zinc modified HY zeolite: Elucidating reaction mechanism and kinetics including deactivation The gas phase alkylation of m-cresol with iso-propanol to give thymol over an acidic catalyst is a commercially important reaction. The present study investigates the kinetics of this reaction in an external and intraparticle mass diffusion-free regime. Deactivation of the reaction over high Lewis acidic Zn loaded HY catalyst is also investigated with time-on-stream in an atmospheric plug flow packed bed reactor. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimentally obtained product distribution and suitable phenomenological model is derived and fitted to the kinetic data. Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) model with surface reaction is found to fit the data well. The deactivation kinetics due to active site fouling and pore plugging are also included in the model and all the kinetic parameters are estimated for use in a packed bed reactor design for process scale-up.
