Synthesis and characterization of polyamide 1010 and evaluation of its cast-extruded films for meat preservation This study holistically evaluates the potential of polyamide 1010 (PA1010) in the form of monolayer films for meat preservation applications. First, decamethylenediamine and sebacic acid, both derived from natural and renewable castor oil, were used to form a “nylon salt” that was subsequently polymerized at 230 °C by condensation reaction, yielding high-molecular-weight (MW) PA1010. The resulting fully bio-based polyamide was, thereafter, processed into 145-μm films by cast extrusion and characterized to ascertain their effectiveness in food packaging. Results showed that the PA1010 films were highly transparent, thermally stable up to approximately 340 °C, and very balanced in terms of mechanical strength and ductility, breaking at elongations higher than 150%. The permeability tests revealed that the PA1010 films present a high barrier to water and aroma vapors and a medium barrier to oxygen. Interestingly, the oxygen barrier performance of PA1010 presented low moisture dependence, outperforming currently available biopolymers. Finally, the PA1010 films were applied to package fresh pork fillets in thermosealed bags, proving to be effective in preserving the physicochemical and microbiological quality of meat for up to seven days of storage at 5 °C.
