You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and characterization of polyamide 1010 and evaluation of its cast-extruded films for meat preservation This study holistically evaluates the potential of polyamide 1010 (PA1010) in the form of monolayer films for meat preservation applications. First, decamethylenediamine and sebacic acid, both derived from natural and renewable castor oil, were used to form a “nylon salt” that was subsequently polymerized at 230 °C by condensation reaction, yielding high-molecular-weight (MW) PA1010. The resulting fully bio-based polyamide was, thereafter, processed into 145-μm films by cast extrusion and characterized to ascertain their effectiveness in food packaging. Results showed that the PA1010 films were highly transparent, thermally stable up to approximately 340 °C, and very balanced in terms of mechanical strength and ductility, breaking at elongations higher than 150%. The permeability tests revealed that the PA1010 films present a high barrier to water and aroma vapors and a medium barrier to oxygen. Interestingly, the oxygen barrier performance of PA1010 presented low moisture dependence, outperforming currently available biopolymers. Finally, the PA1010 films were applied to package fresh pork fillets in thermosealed bags, proving to be effective in preserving the physicochemical and microbiological quality of meat for up to seven days of storage at 5 °C.
