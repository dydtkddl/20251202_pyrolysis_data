You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorptive removal of heavy metals, dyes, and pharmaceuticals: Carbon-based nanomaterials in focus The use of carbon-based nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, carbon dots, graphene/graphene oxide, fullerene, and their derivatives, in the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater has become a promising method in water treatment. These nanomaterials exhibit exceptional adsorption capabilities and selectivity due to their extensive surface area, customizable surface chemistry, and unique structural features, which involve factors like π-π interactions, electrostatic interactions, and specific surface functional groups. A notable experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of carbon nanotubes as adsorbents for removing Ismate violet 2R dye from contaminated water. The results showed a remarkable maximum removal efficiency of 91.71 % at a concentration of 10 mg/L within a brief 120-min period. This article conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the adsorptive removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater using carbon-based nanomaterials, with a focus on developments between 2015 and 2023. An in-depth bibliometric analysis of 1285 research publications retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases reveals a substantial increase in the number of publications, rising from 50 in 2015 to 158 in 2023. This signifies a burgeoning emphasis on both practical application and technological advancement in this domain. Furthermore, this review explores the intricacies of adsorption mechanisms, factors influencing the adsorption performance of carbon-based nanomaterials, and the associated challenges and limitations when applied in wastewater treatment. By thoroughly investigating these constraints and potential advantages, this article provides valuable insights for the development of future carbon-based nanomaterials, aiming to enhance their efficiency and expand their applications in the field of wastewater treatment.
