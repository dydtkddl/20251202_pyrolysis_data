Solvothermal synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles: A review of applications, challenges, and future perspectives Solvothermal synthesis has become a potent and adaptable method for producing metal oxide nanomaterials under control. This technique has been widely used to create important metal oxides, including vanadium oxides (VxOy), iron oxides (FexOy), CeO₂, CuO, ZnO₂, TiO₂, and NiO nanoparticles. This review thoroughly examines how key parameters such as solvent selection, reaction temperature, pressure, and other environmental factors govern the resultant morphology and particle size of these nanomaterials. We critically assess the advantages and limitations of solvothermal methods, particularly their ability to produce uniform nanostructures, and the challenges related to scalability and solvent handling. Recent developments are discussed, including non-classical crystallization mechanisms, solvent dynamics, and precursor chemistry that influence nucleation and growth. Furthermore, we highlight the diverse applications of solvothermal synthesized nanomaterials in catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, and optoelectronics, concluding with a discussion of future directions for this rapidly evolving field.
