You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Long-time simulation of catalytic MTO reaction in a fluidized bed reactor with a coarse-grained discrete particle method — EMMS-DPM Long-time behaviors widely exist in gas–solid reactors, e.g., the coke deposition and catalyst deactivation in the methanol to olefins (MTO) process. Due to the limitation of the computational cost, previous simulations of MTO reactors were mainly conducted with two-fluid model at short-time scales and assumed that the catalyst are perfectly mixed. Efficient simulation methods are, therefore, highly desirable, even for evaluating the assumptions through very long-time investigation. In this study, the MTO reaction kinetics is incorporated into a coarse-grained discrete particle method, namely EMMS-DPM, to simulate a pilot-scale reactor for 8 h of physical time. The simulation is validated by comparing the obtained gaseous products and coke contents with the experimental data. The perfect mixing assumption is validated by observing the residence time distribution of the catalyst for the whole reactor. The detailed coke content could provide more accurate data for accelerating steady state simulations. Furthermore, the relation between the coke content and age of the catalyst is directly obtained for the first time, which is valuable to effective use of the catalyst before discharging. The coke content is positively correlated to the age, but is also influenced by local conditions. For example, near the distributor, the catalyst particles are not well mixed and the maximum reaction rate fluctuates significantly even at large time scales. Thus, long-time particle-scale simulation would provide more dynamic details to characterize the reaction in the critical regions of the reactor, thus being very helpful to optimize operating conditions and the reactor designs.
