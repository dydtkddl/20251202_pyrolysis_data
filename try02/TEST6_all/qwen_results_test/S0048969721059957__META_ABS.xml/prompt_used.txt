You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct 3D printing of zero valent iron@polylactic acid catalyst for tetracycline degradation with magnetically inducing active persulfate Catalyst stability has become a challenging issue for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Herein, we report an alternative method based on 3D printing technology to obtain zero-valent iron polylactic acid prototypes (ZVI@PLA) in a single step and without post etching treatment. ZVI@PLA was used to activate persulfate (PS) for the removal of Tetracycline (TC) in recirculating mode under two different heating methodologies, thermal bath and contactless heating promoted by magnetic induction (MIH). The effect of both heating methodologies was systematically analysed by comparing the kinetic constant of the degradation processes. It was demonstrated that the non-contact heating of ZVI by MIH reactivates the surface of the catalyst, renewing the surface iron content exposed to the pollutant solution, which makes the ZVI@PLA catalyst reusable up to 10 cycles with no efficiency reduction. In contrast, by using a conventional thermal bath, the kinetic constant gradually decreases over the 10 cycles, because of the superficial iron consumption, being the kinetic constant 5 times lower in the 10th run compared to MIH experiment. X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metallic iron embedded in the ZVI@PLA prototype, whose crystalline structure remained unchanged for 10th cycles of MIH. Moreover, it was proven that with no contact heating technology at low magnetic fields (12.2 mT), the solution temperature does not increase, but only the surface of the catalyst does. Under these superficial heated conditions, kinetic rate is increased up to 0.016 min-1 compared to the value of 0.0086 min-1 obtained for conventional heating at 20 °C. This increase is explained not only by PS activation by iron leaching but also by the contribution of ZVI in the heterogeneous activation of persulfate.
