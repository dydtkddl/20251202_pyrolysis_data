You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvent switch strategy to facilitate the downstream process of chemical recycling of plastics Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly persistent in the environment, and current recycling strategies remain inefficient, particularly for textiles where polyester is interwoven with other fibers. Existing cosolvent-assisted methanolysis approaches allow mild reaction conditions but require large amounts of antisolvents for monomer recovery. Here, we report methyl acetate (MeOAc) as a cosolvent that enables rapid PET methanolysis within 1 h at 65 °C while simultaneously driving dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) precipitation in MeOH/MeOAc mixtures. This strategy affords 97 % DMT yield with >98 % purity through simple crystallization and filtration. DFT calculations show that MeOH/MeOAc blends enhance DMT desolvation and crystallization relative to conventional solvents. Crucially, monomer recovery occurs at room temperature without antisolvents or extended cooling, achieving a 29 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within a closed-loop framework. The method selectively depolymerizes PET from both pure polyester and blended textiles, underscoring its potential as a scalable and sustainable solution to PET waste accumulation.
