You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of Cynara cardunculus L. samples – Effect of operating conditions and bed stage on the evolution of the conversion The effect of different parameters on the pyrolysis of Cynara cardunculus L. was studied through an innovative technique based on a precision scale, capable of measuring the time evolution of the biomass samples mass during their thermochemical conversion process while moving freely inside a fluidized bed. A silica sand bed reactor, operated under different values of excess gas velocity and reactor temperature, was employed to hold the pyrolysis reaction of cardoon particles of three different size ranges. The pyrolysis was accelerated for higher excess gas velocities, obtaining pyrolysis times as short as 17.3 s for experiments conducted under bubbling fluidized bed regimes, compared to 185.9 s required to complete the pyrolysis of the same sample in a fixed bed configuration. Similarly, the effect of increasing the reactor temperature promoted faster heating rates across the fuel samples, especially under fixed bed configurations, for which the pyrolysis time is reduced from 321.7 s to 132.0 s when increasing the bed temperature from 450 to 650 °C. Regarding the biomass particle size, small sizes are preferred to minimize the conduction thermal resistance inside the fuel particles and, thus, reduce pyrolysis times and increase volatile yields for the pyrolysis in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The opposite result was found when the pyrolysis took place in non-bubbling beds, where the use of larger particles is beneficial to accelerate the biomass pyrolysis reaction.
