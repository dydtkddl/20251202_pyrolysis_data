You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of polypropylene waste-derived graphene sheets in the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles Graphene nanosheets (GNSs) derived from polypropylene (PP) plastic waste were deposited over Cr2O3, CuO, and NiO nanoparticles as unsupported catalysts in an innovative study. For each catalyst, a specific graphene deposition route was indicated along with the features of the active species and their function. The unsupported catalysts were prepared using a simple combustion method. A simple two-step method was used to synthesize graphene sheets over metal oxide nanoparticles via pyrolysis of waste PP. Several analytical techniques, including XRD, TPR, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, were used to characterize the nanoparticles before and after graphene deposition. The results indicated that Cr2O3 produced more graphene than NiO and CuO, despite its poor reducibility and weak catalytic decomposition character towards the inlet gaseous hydrocarbons. An exceptional graphene deposition route over Cr2O3 was assumed, which was based on the dehydrogenation and aromatization procedure for the inlet hydrocarbons, as well as the function of Cr2O3 redox species. The results revealed a difference in graphene deposition behavior between redox-active species of Cr2O3 and metallic Ni and Cu, which were generated from NiO and CuO. Several graphene morphologies were produced according to the type of catalyst used during the production process.
