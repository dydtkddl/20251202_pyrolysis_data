Synthesis of polypropylene waste-derived graphene sheets in the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles Graphene nanosheets (GNSs) derived from polypropylene (PP) plastic waste were deposited over Cr2O3, CuO, and NiO nanoparticles as unsupported catalysts in an innovative study. For each catalyst, a specific graphene deposition route was indicated along with the features of the active species and their function. The unsupported catalysts were prepared using a simple combustion method. A simple two-step method was used to synthesize graphene sheets over metal oxide nanoparticles via pyrolysis of waste PP. Several analytical techniques, including XRD, TPR, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, were used to characterize the nanoparticles before and after graphene deposition. The results indicated that Cr2O3 produced more graphene than NiO and CuO, despite its poor reducibility and weak catalytic decomposition character towards the inlet gaseous hydrocarbons. An exceptional graphene deposition route over Cr2O3 was assumed, which was based on the dehydrogenation and aromatization procedure for the inlet hydrocarbons, as well as the function of Cr2O3 redox species. The results revealed a difference in graphene deposition behavior between redox-active species of Cr2O3 and metallic Ni and Cu, which were generated from NiO and CuO. Several graphene morphologies were produced according to the type of catalyst used during the production process.
