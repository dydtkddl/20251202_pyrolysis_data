Hyphenated solvent-free extraction and ionic liquid-involved “sandwich” membranes separation for polysaccharides, phenols and amino acids from bamboo As known to all, bamboo and its juice are important resources for industrial crops as well as functional aliments. In this study, an ionic liquid-involved “sandwich” membranes system was developed for one-step separation of polysaccharides, phenols and amino acids in bamboo juice, which was prepared with solvent-free microwave-ultrasound hyphenated way. After that, the feed liquid enriched the bamboo polysaccharides with high molecular weight, the receptor liquid (stripping phase) contained amino acids and the phenolic compounds were recovered from the ionic liquid phase. Related separation conditions and kinetics were both investigated, and the products together with their yield and bioactivity were all compared between the new systematic separation system and conventional single fraction-targeted ways. According to the whole results, it can be proved that the system and device have the advantages of mild conditions, simple operation, highly hyphenated degree, environmental friendliness, and easy continuous enrichment and recycling to obtain bioactive large and small molecules simultaneously.
