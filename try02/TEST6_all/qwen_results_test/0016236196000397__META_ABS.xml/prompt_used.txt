You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of coal moisture content on carbon deposition in coke ovens The formation of carbon deposits from coal pyrolysis in a two-stage reactor was studied at a constant cracking temperature of 900°C for several moisture contents of the coal charge ranging from 0.8 to 15 wt%. Whatever the coal moisture content, the formation of the deposits, the mass of which was continuously monitored during a pyrolysis run by a gravimetric balance system, was characterized by two distinct stages. The average deposition rate decreased progressively with increasing moisture content up to 8 wt%, then increased sharply beyond 8 wt%. Deposits observed under the polarized light microscope presented two different structures depending on the coal moisture content. For contents < 8 wt%, deposits were characterized by the superimposition of a spherulitic and a laminar texture, but the texture beyond 8% was only laminar. A model of the temperature field within the coal mass is proposed to explain the effect of moisture on carbon deposit formation. Results from this model as well as analyses of primary and secondary tars indicate that in the reactor the water added to the coal has no effect on the gas phase in which deposits are formed but acts directly within the coal mass, modifying both the yield and the composition of the volatile matter and consequently its capacity to form deposits.
