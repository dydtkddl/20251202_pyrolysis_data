Reaction products of styrene-butadiene ABA block copolymer in supercritical toluene and tetralin A styrene-butadiene ABA block copolymer (28 wt % styrene content) was thermolysed in a supercritical toluene-tetralin mixture at 349 °C and 13.8 MPa in a 1-dm3 batch autoclave. The derived products were examined by means of capillary column gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopy. A total of 131 components including isomers were identified. The extensive cracking of the polymer results in low molecular-weight aromatics consisting mainly of xylenes, other alkylbenzenes, and diphenylalkanes.
