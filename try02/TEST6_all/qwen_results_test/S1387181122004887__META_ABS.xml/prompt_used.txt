You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Systematic study of low temperature cracking of low-density polyethylene with ZSM-5 The viability of cracking low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over H-ZSM-5 catalysts at reaction temperatures below 300 °C was demonstrated using ZSM-5 catalysts with varying textual properties and acid site content. While ZSM-5 made from standard syntheses could catalyze LDPE cracking it was found that increasing the external surface area of H-ZSM-5 from 24 m2/g to 325 m2/g resulted in a dramatic increase in LDPE conversion. For all catalysts the products were permanent hydrocarbon gas products in the C1–C5 range. H-ZSM-5 prepared in nanosheet and nanosphere morphologies achieved 64 wt% and 58 wt% LDPE conversion, respectively, compared to a standard H-ZSM-5 sample with micron-sized crystals that achieved 28 wt% conversion after 8 h at 250 °C under inert conditions. It was also found that strong Brønsted acid sites were necessary for high conversion of LDPE in this temperature regime as shown by the relatively weaker solid acid catalysts Al-MCM-41 and B-MFI converting negligible LDPE under the same reaction conditions. Lastly, a low molecular weight model molecule (n-tetracosane) was tested to gain insight into the cracking mechanism of LDPE over MFI catalysts. The findings in this work point to new approaches for catalyst design to achieve low temperature LDPE depolymerization.
