You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Technology advances and techno-economic analysis of the carbon materials derived from biowaste utilization Due to the low cost, abundant resources and multiple functions, the biowaste derived carbon materials have aroused great research attention in the fields of waste management, energy utilization, and environmental remediation. The carbon materials derived from biowaste utilization (C-BW) could serve as highly efficient absorbents to clean the toxic heavy metal ions and persistent organic compounds from different environmental media. Previous research confirmed that the biowaste feedstock and the pyrolysis method were the determining factors that influenced the C-BW performances. In addition, considering the pyrolysis process was an energy consuming and labor intensive process, the economic feasibility of the C-BW producing strategies could determine the final commercialization of a particular C-BW production project. Therefore, the current review focused on summarizing the recent advances on the C-BW production in terms of the types of biowaste feedstock, pyrolysis technique advances, as well as the techno-economic analysis on these utilization strategies. Moreover, a general framework for the techno-economic analysis of C-BW was proposed, which provides a plausible model for the future economic feasibility studies. The future perspective of C-BW is also discussed, which could shed light on the technological development of the C-BW production industry.
