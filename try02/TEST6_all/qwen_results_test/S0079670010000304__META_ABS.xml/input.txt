Polymer/layered silicate (clay) nanocomposites: An overview of flame retardancy A review is presented of the recent developments concerning the use of layered silicates (clay) for designing polymer nanocomposites endowed with enhanced flame retardancy. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the effect of layered silicates is beneficial mostly for retarding flame spread in developing fires, but not at the stage of ignition or in the case of fully developed fires. Accordingly, the need for incorporating conventional flame retardants in nanocomposites is discussed, providing detailed examples reported in open literature.
