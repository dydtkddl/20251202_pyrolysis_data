You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of Light Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Biomass by Catalytic Pyrolysis Catalytic pyrolysis of three kinds of woody biomass was carried out using a dual-particle powder fluidized bed reactor to produce light aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and naphthalene (BTXN). The results showed that pyrolysis temperature of biomass was very low, and about 92% of the volatile matter in the biomass can be released at 673 K, indicating that the biomass was suitable for catalytic pyrolysis at low temperature. The tar in the volatile matter was the product of the primary decomposition, and it was then transformed to lower molecular hydrocarbon compounds at higher temperature during the secondary reaction. The biomass pyrolysis product distribution could be controlled by adjusting the secondary reaction parameters. The test results of the catalytic hydropyrolysis of the biomass over different catalysts showed that the pyrolysis product distribution depended much on the catalyst types and the pyrolysis temperature. BTXN were the intermediates of the secondary reaction during the pyrolysis or hydropyrolysis process. When biomass was hydropyrolyzed in the fluidized bed with the CoMo-S/Al2O3 catalyst, BTXN yield reached 6.3% (BTX: 5.5%; N: 0.8%) at 863 K. However, the highest CH4 yield of 99.5% was obtained when a NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was used. Therefore, it is important to select a catalyst with proper hydrogenation activity to obtain the highest yield of BTXN. Different types of woody biomass with similar compositions results in similar product distributions.
