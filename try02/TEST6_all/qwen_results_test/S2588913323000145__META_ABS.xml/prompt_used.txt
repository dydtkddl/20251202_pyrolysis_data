You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polypropylene pyrolysis and steam reforming over Fe-based catalyst supported on activated carbon for the production of hydrogen-rich syngas The purpose of this study is to explore a method for the high-yield production of hydrogen by pyrolysis and steam reforming of polymer plastics. The developed Fe-based catalyst supported on activated carbon was applied to reactions with polypropylene for hydrogen production. The effects of iron loading (%) in the catalyst, the total catalyst amount, and the water content in the reaction atmosphere on the performance of hydrogen and gas production were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the hydrogen yield without water added reached 38.73 mmol/gPP, and this yield was significantly improved by adding water into the reaction atmosphere. By optimizing the amount of water added, the hydrogen yield reached 112.71 mmol/gPP. The surface morphology and structural components of the fresh and used catalysts were characterized, and the morphology and quantity of carbon deposition on the catalyst were analysed. The catalytic stability of the 15Fe/AC catalyst was determined by repeating the test 10 times under the optimal reaction conditions. As the reaction time increased, the selectivity of the catalyst for hydrogen decreased and that for hydrocarbons increased. Moreover, the experimental method used in this study had excellent hydrogen production capacity. Thus, this study provided a novel method for the high-efficiency production of hydrogen by pyrolysis and steam reforming of polymer plastics.
