Synergistic effects of biomass/plastics and multi-step regulation of H2O in the co-production of H2-CNTs by gasification of biomass and plastic wastes The current unsustainable management of biomass and plastics is exacerbating environmental pollution and energy problems. Recovering high-value carbon (CNTs) and hydrogen (H2) products from solid wastes through thermal catalysis is a practical way to achieve energy recovery cycles. By synthesizing highly uniformly dispersed catalysts, utilizing Reax-FF simulations, and conducting DFT calculations, the study explored the regulation mechanism of H2-CNTs by biomass/plastic mixing and H2O, established a complete reaction pathway, and achieved the synergistic production of high-quality CNTs (90 mg/g) and H2 (34 mmol/g). The results show that biomass/plastic co-gasification can increase the yield (by 88 %-95 %) and purity (by 21 %-37 %) of CNTs. In the mixed reaction of biomass and plastic, ·OH in biomass triggers polyethene to form ·H, and ·H induces H2O to generate H2. The regulatory effects of H2O before, during, and after the formation of CNTs are as follows: (i) ·OH is generated to promote the decomposition of macromolecules into H2. (ii) ·OH acts on the surface of the catalyst to inhibit the surface diffusion of C. (iii) Etching amorphous carbon improves the purity of CNTs. The work provides theoretical guidance and methodological references for analyzing the generation of H2 in complex atmospheres and regulating the structure of CNTs.
