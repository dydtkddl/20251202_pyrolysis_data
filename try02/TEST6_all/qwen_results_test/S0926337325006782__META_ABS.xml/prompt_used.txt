You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects of biomass/plastics and multi-step regulation of H2O in the co-production of H2-CNTs by gasification of biomass and plastic wastes The current unsustainable management of biomass and plastics is exacerbating environmental pollution and energy problems. Recovering high-value carbon (CNTs) and hydrogen (H2) products from solid wastes through thermal catalysis is a practical way to achieve energy recovery cycles. By synthesizing highly uniformly dispersed catalysts, utilizing Reax-FF simulations, and conducting DFT calculations, the study explored the regulation mechanism of H2-CNTs by biomass/plastic mixing and H2O, established a complete reaction pathway, and achieved the synergistic production of high-quality CNTs (90 mg/g) and H2 (34 mmol/g). The results show that biomass/plastic co-gasification can increase the yield (by 88 %-95 %) and purity (by 21 %-37 %) of CNTs. In the mixed reaction of biomass and plastic, ·OH in biomass triggers polyethene to form ·H, and ·H induces H2O to generate H2. The regulatory effects of H2O before, during, and after the formation of CNTs are as follows: (i) ·OH is generated to promote the decomposition of macromolecules into H2. (ii) ·OH acts on the surface of the catalyst to inhibit the surface diffusion of C. (iii) Etching amorphous carbon improves the purity of CNTs. The work provides theoretical guidance and methodological references for analyzing the generation of H2 in complex atmospheres and regulating the structure of CNTs.
