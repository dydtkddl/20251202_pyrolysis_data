You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and microkinetic investigation of thermo-catalytic ammonia decomposition over a Ba-promoted Ru/Ni-BCZY catalyst for use in ammonia-fed protonic ceramic cells Direct ammonia-fed Protonic Ceramic Cells (NH3-PCC) hold great promise for efficient energy generation, since ammonia can be used directly as fuel at the anode without the need of prior cracking to hydrogen. This study evaluates the catalytic activity of barium-promoted ruthenium catalysts supported on Ni-BCZY cermet particles in a packed-bed reactor, and provides a microkinetic model for simulation of the thermo-catalytic ammonia decomposition reaction. Among the catalysts tested, the 0.5 wt% Ru and 1 wt% Ba supported on a Ni-BCZY cermet exhibited the best performance, requiring less active material. The addition of Ru and Ba improved the catalytic activity of the bare Ni-BCZY cermet, which also shows catalytic activity due to Ni active sites. A new set of microkinetic model parameters is presented, combining Ba-promoted ruthenium and nickel surface steps. This model was used to conduct a parametric simulation, providing insights into the impact of the operating conditions.
