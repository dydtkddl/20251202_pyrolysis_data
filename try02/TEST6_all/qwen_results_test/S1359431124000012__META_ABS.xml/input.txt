Multi-aspect analysis and optimization of biomass-fueled multi-generation plant Biomass fuels are an interesting renewable energy, which represents a higher performance, especially their integrated mode with the solid oxide fuel cell. This integration provides a higher thermodynamic performance along with a lower environmental impact. Hence, the current paper proposes an innovative multi-generation consisting of biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine cycle. This integration's wasted heat is harnessed via a steam Rankine cycle, a double-effect refrigeration cycle, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. Furthermore, the heat loss of the steam Rankine cycle is utilized to drive an organic Rankine cycle. The energy, exergy, economic, and environmental approaches are implemented to attain the designed scheme's performance. Five multi-objective optimization scenarios are applied to assess a proper optimal operating mode. The results showed that the gasifier is the main source of exergy destruction, with a value of 597.4 kW. Also, the increment of cell number in the fuel cell and gasification temperature reduces both thermodynamic and economic performances. At the optimal state, the deigned configuration’s exergy efficiency and payback period are attained about 60.03% and 1.45 years.
