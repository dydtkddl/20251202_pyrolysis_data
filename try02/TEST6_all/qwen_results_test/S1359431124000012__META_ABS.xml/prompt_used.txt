You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-aspect analysis and optimization of biomass-fueled multi-generation plant Biomass fuels are an interesting renewable energy, which represents a higher performance, especially their integrated mode with the solid oxide fuel cell. This integration provides a higher thermodynamic performance along with a lower environmental impact. Hence, the current paper proposes an innovative multi-generation consisting of biomass-fueled solid oxide fuel cell combined with a gas turbine cycle. This integration's wasted heat is harnessed via a steam Rankine cycle, a double-effect refrigeration cycle, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. Furthermore, the heat loss of the steam Rankine cycle is utilized to drive an organic Rankine cycle. The energy, exergy, economic, and environmental approaches are implemented to attain the designed scheme's performance. Five multi-objective optimization scenarios are applied to assess a proper optimal operating mode. The results showed that the gasifier is the main source of exergy destruction, with a value of 597.4 kW. Also, the increment of cell number in the fuel cell and gasification temperature reduces both thermodynamic and economic performances. At the optimal state, the deigned configuration’s exergy efficiency and payback period are attained about 60.03% and 1.45 years.
