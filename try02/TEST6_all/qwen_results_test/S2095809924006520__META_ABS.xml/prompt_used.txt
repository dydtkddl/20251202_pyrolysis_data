You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

β-sheet Engineering of IsPETase for PET Depolymerization The enzymatic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a sustainable approach for the recycling of PET waste. Great efforts have been devoted to engineering PET depolymerases on the substrate binding cleft and the surrounding loops/α-helices on the surface. Here, we report the systematic engineering of whole β-sheet regions in the core of IsPETase (a PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis) via a fluorescent high-throughput screening assay. Twenty-one beneficial substitutions were obtained and iteratively recombined. The best variant, DepoPETase β, with an increase in the melting temperatures (T m) of 22.9 °C, exhibited superior depolymerization performance and enabled complete depolymerization of 100.5 g of untreated post-consumer PET (pc-PET; 0.26% W enzyme/W PET enzyme loading) in liter-scale bioreactor at 50 °C within 4 d. Crystallization and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the improved activity and thermostability of DepoPETase β were due to enhanced hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in the β-sheet region, a more tightly packed structure of the core sheets and the surrounding helix, and improved binding of PET to the active sites. This study not only demonstrates the importance of engineering strategy in the β-sheet region of PET hydrolases but also provides a potential PET depolymerase for large-scale PET recycling.
