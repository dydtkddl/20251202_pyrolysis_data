You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lumped-kinetic modeling and experiments on co-pyrolysis of palm kernel cake with polystyrene using a closed-tubing reactor to upgrade pyrolysis products Lumped-kinetic modeling and experiments (with validation) were performed on palm kernel cake/polystyrene (PKC/PS) blend co-pyrolysis in a closed-tubing reactor. The lsqcurvefit function and ode solver defined in the Matlab software were properly applied to predict the profile of product yields and to determine exactly the kinetic parameters of the reactions involved in PKC/PS blend co-pyrolysis. The different iso-conversional methods based on thermogravimetric analysis were used to calculate the activation energy needed for thermal decomposition of PKC, PS, and the PKC/PS blend. A synergistic effect existed in the blend of PKC/PS (with 20 wt% PS) because its activation energy was lower than that of the individual materials. The co-pyrolysis not only improved the quantity but also the quality of the bio-oil product, providing a high proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. The O and N contents of the bio-oil were reduced during co-pyrolysis via the hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodenitrogenation reactions. The highest heating value of the oil was 34.17 MJ/kg obtained in co-pyrolysis of PKC/PS at 773 K for 12 min. The co-pyrolysis increased the selectivity of H2 and hydrocarbon gases, and decreased the COx content. The biochar with high heating value and inorganic compounds content, and having a porous structure, can act as a catalyst and can be used as a solid fuel. This approach provides an efficient method for upgrading comprehensively the pyrolysis products using PS as the H2-donor source.
