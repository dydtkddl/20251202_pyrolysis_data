You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of low oxygen bio-oil via catalytic pyrolysis of forest residues in a kilogram-scale rotary kiln reactor Co-processing of pyrolysis bio-oils with fossil feedstock in existing refineries has been identified as a way to introduce renewable carbon in transportation fuels. Significant deoxygenation of bio-oil, which can be achieved by catalytic pyrolysis, is a prerequisite to increase the amount that could be supplied. In this study, following the optimisation of the conversion of eucalyptus residues using calcium oxide catalyst at bench scale, pyrolysis tests have been conducted at kilogram-scale on a rotary kiln reactor to investigate the suitability of produced bio-oils for co-processing. A fractional condensation technique was also employed to reduce the bio-oil water content in a single step. The results evidenced enhanced deoxygenation at kg-scale as a consequence of greater interactions between catalysts and volatiles in the rotary kiln reactor. The combination of enhanced deoxygenation and fractional condensation resulted in the production of an organic rich fraction with an oxygen content of 12.6 wt% and a Higher Heating Value of 35.5 MJ/kg (dry basis). This fraction could be considered for co-processing in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit to produce transportation fuels.
