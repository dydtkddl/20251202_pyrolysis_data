Single atom iron as an efficient electrocatalyst for enhanced kinetics in magnesium-sulfur batteries Magnesium-sulfur battery (MSB) with the advantages of low cost, high theoretical energy density and high security is regarding as a promising energy storage system. However, it suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics, fast capacity fading and poor cycling stability due to the shortage of compatible electrolyte and high performance cathode. Herein, Fe single atom catalyst is introduced to improve the electrochemical performance of MSB for the first time. Fe atoms are uniformly dispersed on graphene support by a facile method to prepare Fe-N-G, which is applied as an effective sulfur host. Benefited from the remarkable catalytic performance of the single-atom Fe, the produced S@ Fe-N-G exhibits a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 962 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, outstanding cycling stability of maintaining 892.7 mA h g−1 at 0.3C after 200 cycles and excellent rate capability. It is expected that this work could promote the development of more high-efficient single-atom catalysts for high performance MSB.
