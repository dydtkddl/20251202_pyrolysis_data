Selective oxidation of polystyrene to benzoic acid with VOx/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts Currently, various upcycling methods for polystyrene (PS) have been reported; however, more efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly strategies remain to be developed. In this work, an amorphous silica-alumina-supported vanadium oxide (VOx/SiO2–Al2O3) catalyst was successfully prepared. This catalyst exhibits excellent performance in the selective oxidation of polystyrene to benzoic acid. Under the conditions of 1 MPa O2 and 220 °C for 4 h, benzoic acid selectivity reached 71.5 % at complete PS conversion. Reaction mechanism studies suggest that the C–C bonds of PS are initially protonated at strong Brønsted acid sites on the SiO2–Al2O3, generating carbocations that are rapidly cleaved into smaller fragments. Highly dispersed VOx species then abstract hydrogen atoms from the backbone of the PS fragments via a dynamic V5+/V4+redox cycle, triggering β-scission of C–C bonds to form aldehydic/ketonic intermediates. These intermediates are subsequently oxidized to benzoic acid by VOx species. Furthermore, the catalytic system was successfully applied to real-world PS waste. Six common types of daily-use PS plastics were tested, all of which were completely converted, yielding approximately 70 % benzoic acid.
