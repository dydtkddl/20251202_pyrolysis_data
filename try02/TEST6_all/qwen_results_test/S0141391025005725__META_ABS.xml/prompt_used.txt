You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective oxidation of polystyrene to benzoic acid with VOx/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts Currently, various upcycling methods for polystyrene (PS) have been reported; however, more efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly strategies remain to be developed. In this work, an amorphous silica-alumina-supported vanadium oxide (VOx/SiO2–Al2O3) catalyst was successfully prepared. This catalyst exhibits excellent performance in the selective oxidation of polystyrene to benzoic acid. Under the conditions of 1 MPa O2 and 220 °C for 4 h, benzoic acid selectivity reached 71.5 % at complete PS conversion. Reaction mechanism studies suggest that the C–C bonds of PS are initially protonated at strong Brønsted acid sites on the SiO2–Al2O3, generating carbocations that are rapidly cleaved into smaller fragments. Highly dispersed VOx species then abstract hydrogen atoms from the backbone of the PS fragments via a dynamic V5+/V4+redox cycle, triggering β-scission of C–C bonds to form aldehydic/ketonic intermediates. These intermediates are subsequently oxidized to benzoic acid by VOx species. Furthermore, the catalytic system was successfully applied to real-world PS waste. Six common types of daily-use PS plastics were tested, all of which were completely converted, yielding approximately 70 % benzoic acid.
