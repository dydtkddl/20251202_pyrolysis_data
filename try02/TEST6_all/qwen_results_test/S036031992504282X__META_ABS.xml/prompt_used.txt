You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction mechanism of polyvinylidene fluoride in supercritical water: product distribution, role of supercritical water, F-element migration pathway and hydrogen formation mechanism Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) technology is expected to cleanly and efficiently treat waste polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), however, the conversion mechanism of PVDF in supercritical water (SCW) is still unclear. This paper employed experiments and molecular dynamics simulation to study the reaction properties of PVDF in SCW including the hydrogen supplying role of SCW, the F-element migration pathway and the mechanism of H2 formation. Detailed analysis of the product distribution identified the mechanisms affecting temperature, reaction time and feedstock concentration on the supercritical water gasification of PVDF. The H2 yield of 34.04 mol/kg and carbon gasification efficiency (CE) of 92.87 % were achieved in the experiment confirming the potential of PVDF gasification for H2 production. The comparison of experimental and simulation results of PVDF pyrolysis and SCWG proved that SCW acted as a hydrogen donor to improve the conversion efficiency of PVDF. The attack of SCW can accelerate the C–C breakage in PVDF to form intermediates (INT), which decreased the energy barrier of decomposition by 26.2 %–326 kJ/mol compared to pyrolysis without SCW. The F-element in PVDF was assigned to HF and organic fluorides after a series of free radical reactions. H2 was formed mainly through H radical coupling and water participation in the reaction. This study may reveal the reaction mechanism of PVDF in SCW and provide a theoretical framework for the development of F pollution control strategies.
