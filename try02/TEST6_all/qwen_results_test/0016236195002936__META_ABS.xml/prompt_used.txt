You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sorbent behaviour in circulating fluidized bed combustors: Relevance of thermally induced fractures to particle size dependence The particle size dependence of the performance of various limestones and dolostones in capturing SO2 in fluidized bed combustors was determined and explained in terms of the occurrence of thermally induced fractures (TIFs). Data were obtained in a bench-scale fluidized bed reactor, a pilot-scale down-fired combustor and a 30 MW(e) circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC). Finer particle size fractions (100 × 400 mesh, 38–150 μm) had lower Ca/S molar ratios than coarser size fractions (> 100 mesh, > 150 μm) in the bed ash and recycle ash from the 30 MW(e) CFBC. Upon further sulfation of the ashes in a thermogravimetric analyser, the < 400 mesh (< 38 μm) fraction captured the most additional sulfur, indicating that these particles did not have sufficient residence time in the CFBC to be fully sulfated. For larger particles, the slow rate of SO2 diffusion through the product layer limited the extent of sulfation. Hot-stage scanning electron microscopy and microprobe analysis of the sulfur distribution in the particles indicated that some sorbents developed thermally induced fractures, while others with comparable CaCO3 contents did not. The TIFs promoted SO2 diffusion into the particle and, as a consequence, the sulfation behaviour of such sorbents was less dependent on particle size than was that for sorbents which did not develop TIFs.
