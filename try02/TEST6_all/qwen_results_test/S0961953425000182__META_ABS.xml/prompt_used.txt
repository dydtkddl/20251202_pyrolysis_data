You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Productive esterification of palm fatty acid distillate under lignocellulosic biomass char of rambutan seeds waste-supported sulfonated catalyst The current study focuses on examining the effectiveness of a palm fatty acid distillate and an acidic sulfonated char catalyst derived from lignocellulosic biomass (rambutan seed waste) in the production of biodiesel via esterification. The carbonaceous solid derived from lignocellulosic rambutan seed (RS) was prepared by carbonisation known as rambutan seed char (RSC), followed by sulfonation for acidic catalyst functionalization (RSC‒SO3H). The RS, RSC and RSC-SO3H were physically and chemically characterized using a surface area analyser, ammonia absorption measurement, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and morphology analysis by field emission scanning microscopy. The acid density of RSC-SO3H measured by TPD-NH3 was recorded at 5.62 mmol/g which is higher than that of the raw and charred samples, indicating the success of ‒SO3H impregnation on the RSC porous structure. This acidic catalyst efficacy was tested with a waste feedstock with a high FFA content, PFAD, for the esterification of biodiesel in a closed-system reactor. Response surface methodology was applied to PFAD esterification to study four main reaction variables: catalyst loading (1-5 wt %), reaction temperature (55–95 °C), methanol-PFAD molar ratio (9:1–21:1) and reaction time (1–5 h) by generating 31 experiments. The regression model's coefficient of determination, R2, and R2-adj were statistically measured and recognized as well-fitted at 0.994 and 0.988, respectively. The yield of 93.7 % was optimized under a fitted regression model that was esterified under these conditions; 2.2 wt % of catalyst loading, 83.7 °C, 19:1, 1.16 h. RS-SO3H catalyst reusability test, heterogeneity performance, and regeneration analysis were performed. Important biodiesel characteristics were evaluated and their adherence to international standards was analyzed.
