Mechanisms of microplastic generation from polymer-coated controlled-release fertilizers (PC-CRFs) Polymer-coated controlled-release fertilizers (PC-CRFs) are valued for nutrient efficiency, but concerns remain about the long-term impacts of their plastic coatings on soil health. This study investigates the physicochemical characteristics of two commercially available PC-CRFs, type A and B, and their changes during nutrient release. Accelerated nutrient release experiments were conducted for 25 d in ultrapure water (free water) and saturated soil with five wet-dry cycles. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen release were measured, with lower concentrations found in soil column effluent compared to water. Additionally, studying microplastic (MP) release from type A PC-CRFs during nutrient release showed that a significantly greater number of MPs were released in the soil column than in water. The results also indicated a preferential migration of smaller MPs to the deeper layers of the soil column. Microscopic pores and cracks were observed through surface morphology analysis, likely caused by osmotic pressure during nutrient release, potentially contributing to MP generation. Mechanical degradation of the type A PC-CRF microcapsules was assessed through surface wear and shear tests to simulate the forces exerted by soil particles and agricultural machinery. Our results showed that longer surface wear duration increased the number of generated MPs, while higher loading in surface wear experiments resulted in a larger median diameter of the MPs.
