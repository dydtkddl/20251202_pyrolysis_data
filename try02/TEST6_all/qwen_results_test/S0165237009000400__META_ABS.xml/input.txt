The effect of PVC on thermal and catalytic degradation of polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene by a continuous flow reactor A continuous flow reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure and feed rate of 0–1.5kgh−1 for degradation of PE, PP and PS in presence of 1–2wt% PVC. The degradation temperatures were between 360 and 440°C depending on the feeding material. The influence of PVC, temperature and silica-alumina catalysts on degradation behavior and on the properties of the products was studied and discussed. Different effects were observed for binary PE/PVC, PP/PVC, PS/PVC and complex PE/PP/PS/PVC mixtures due to specific interactions between PVC and each hydrocarbon polyolefin. Silica-alumina catalysts decreased the Cl concentration in oils but it seems to generate high amounts of Cl-containing organic compounds in gases.
