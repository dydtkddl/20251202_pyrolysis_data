You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deposition methods of high-T c superconductors Depositing high-T c oxide superconductors poses the most demanding challenge for thin film technology. The complexity of the superconductor film formation parallels the complexity of the materials themselves. Making films of these materials requires transporting all the elements in the proper stoichiometry onto the substrates, forming the correct crystal structure and layer stacking sequence, and providing sufficient oxygen to form the superconducting phase. Evaporation of separate metal constituents generally is a low-pressure process. A high oxygen-atom arrival rate at the substrate under this restriction can successfully be provided by oxygen rf-plasmas, microwave-generated atomic oxygen, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) sources, and ozone-generation techniques. Sputter deposition suffers from negative ion bombardment of the substrate. This can be minimized by geometries where the substrate is held outside the plasma, and by applying high sputtering pressures with attendant short mean free paths. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) still shows some problems with volatile barium sources. Nevertheless, it represents one of the most promising techniques for large-scale applications. In the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, a high-energy pulse of ultraviolet or visible laser radiation vaporizes and ejects the surface material which impinges on the substrate subsequently. The process runs far off the thermal equilibrium, and therefore produces an extremely good stoichiometric material transfer. Furthermore, parameters can be chosen to allow for a wide dynamic range between molecular beam and heavy sputter conditions. there are practically no restrictions regarding the reactive gas atmosphere in the deposition chamber. Highest quality epitaxial films of the YBa2Cu3O7−δ superconductor made to date have been produced this way. Other approaches include, e.g. thermal spraying, chemical spray pyrolysis, sol-gel spin casting, dipping, and electrodeposition. Nevertheless, traditional vacuum techniques, or the more novel laser deposition processes, are most likely of finding general acceptance for a thin film process.
