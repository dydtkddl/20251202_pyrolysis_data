You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) membranes for thermochemical reduction of CO2: A review Intermediate temperature membrane-supported CO2 thermochemical reduction using renewable energy is a clean approach for reusing CO2. To implement this technology at scale, stable catalytic membrane materials with fast kinetics should be developed, and reactor designs and system integrations should be optimized. In this review, we highlight major advancements in experimental and numerical efforts on mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) membrane-supported CO2 thermochemical reduction, and discuss the connection among materials, kinetics, membranes and reactor design. First, we discuss the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO2 reduction and the working principles of membrane reactors. Two methods are compared: chemical looping (redox) and membrane supported CO2 reduction. Next, we compare CO2 conversion rates on various membrane materials and their stability. Strontium based perovskites, e.g., Nb2O5-doped SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3- δ (SCoF-82) show the highest CO2 reduction rates so far, but they suffer degradation mainly from carbonate formation. Mixed-phase membranes are promising, with high reduction rates and good stability. Surface modification can enhance the reduction rates and increase membrane stabilities. In order to accelerate the development in materials and membranes, kinetic parameters, e.g., conductivity and reaction rate constants should be obtained from high throughput benchtop reactors complemented by reduced physical models. The mechanisms and transport models for surface kinetics and bulk diffusion are summarized. Using these results, changes in membrane morphology and surface chemistry are proposed. Finally, we summarize methods and system-scaled analysis to integrate this membrane technology with renewable or waste heat sources for fuel production and energy storage.
