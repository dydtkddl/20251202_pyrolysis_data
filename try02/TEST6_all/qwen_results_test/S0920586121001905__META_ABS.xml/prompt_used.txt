You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel direct method in one-step for catalytic heavy crude oil upgrading using iron oxide nanoparticles We proposed a direct in situ synthesis method for iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) along with catalytic erformance upgrading of heavy crude oil (HCO). Our method compares the upgrading of a HCO where other iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by a traditional thermal decomposition method of organometallic compounds in the presence of stabilizing agents and solvents of high boiling points. Furthermore, the in situ nanoparticles were extensively characterized by XRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy and TEM microscopy which confirmed the presence of magnetite and akaganeite phases, with an average diameter of 20−43 nm. Nanoparticles by thermal decomposition method were investigated by XRD, UHR-FE-SEM and HRTEM and showed the formation of magnetite nanoparticles with an average diameter of 6.7 ± 1.4 nm. Subsequently, the nanoparticles were evaluated in a batch reactor using HCO from the Golden Lane of Mexico at 44.1 bar (initial H2 pressure) and 380 °C, for 1 h at 500 rpm. It was observed that, even under hydrogen limited conditions, there are better physicochemical properties in terms of viscosity, API gravity and heavy fractions decrease, for example, the residue conversion was about 20 % and the kinetic model was adjusted to a five lump model. The formation of the iron sulfide phase (FeS) was detected during the analysis of the spent catalyst.
