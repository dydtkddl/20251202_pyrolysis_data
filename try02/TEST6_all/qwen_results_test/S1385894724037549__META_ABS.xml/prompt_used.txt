You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Promotion of lignin depolymerization and cellulose utilization via the coupling effects of DDQ pre-oxidation and HCOOH extraction The full utilization of biomass plays an important role in the environment and energy. In this study, the coupling pretreatment of DDQ pre-oxidation and HCOOH extraction was employed to realize the separation and modification of three components of sugarcane bagasse for full utilization. Especially, the modified lignin was depolymerized to obtain aromatic monomers, and cellulose-rich residue was used to prepare lignocellulose straws. Furthermore, the coupling effects between DDQ pre-oxidation and HCOOH extraction on chemical and physical properties of modified lignin and lignocellulose straws were studied. In addition, the mechanism of lignin depolymerization and lignocellulose straw synthesis were explored as well as the mass balance of the biorefinery process. The results showed that the total yield of aromatic monomers increased by nearly 2 times and the conversion of lignin was 95.1 % after DDQ pre-oxidation. The mechanism showed that DDQ selectively oxidized Cα-OH bond of lignin to Cα = O bond, which not only avoided the formation of carbocation, but also reduced the bond dissociation energy of β-O-4 bond. Moreover, the tensile strength of hydrophobic lignocellulose straw increased by nearly 2 times and its flexural strength was 10.36 MPa. Modified lignin and modified cellulose were connected via hydrogen bonds, which enhanced the intermolecular crosslinking of molecules, thus improving the mechanical properties of lignocellulose straws. Besides, the maximum xylose relative content and concentration of xylose were 61.16 % and 17.57 g/L, respectively. This study provides a method for high-value and green utilization of sugarcane bagasse.
