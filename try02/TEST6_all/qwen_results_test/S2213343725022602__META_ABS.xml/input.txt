Waste valorization into K-doped alumina catalysts via Al-MOF templates for efficient COS hydrolysis The catalytic hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfide (COS) is an efficient approach for eliminating sulfur-containing gases from industrial emissions. In this study, a sustainable strategy was developed to convert waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and aluminum cans into high-performance aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) catalysts via a metal–organic framework (Al-MOF) intermediate. The specific surface area of the MOF-derived undoped Al₂O₃ is 171.9 m²/g, while potassium doping increases the surface area to 408.2 m²/g, confirming that alkali metal doping can significantly enhance the textural properties of the catalyst. Potassium impregnation further improved the catalyst's basicity, contributing to superior catalytic activity. The optimized K@w-Al₂O₃ achieved over 90 % COS conversion and nearly 100 % H₂S yield at 300 °C, with stable performance maintained over 24 h of continuous operation. Structural and surface analyses confirmed that MOF templating and K-doping synergistically contributed to the enhanced performance. This work not only demonstrates an effective method for waste valorization but also provides a promising catalyst design for sustainable sulfur removal processes, aligning with circular economy principles and SDG 12.
