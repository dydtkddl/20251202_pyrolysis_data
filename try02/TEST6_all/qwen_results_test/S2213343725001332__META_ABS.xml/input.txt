Zinc-assisted pyrolysis for optimal graphitization of carbon nanotubes for boosted Fenton-like catalysis Carbon-based materials are extensively utilized as catalysts in peroxymonosulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PMS-AOPs). However, their basal active sites often exhibit inferior intrinsic activity, necessitating the development of facile modification techniques to enhance their catalytic efficacy in water purification. This study introduces a facile Zn-assisted pyrolysis strategy designed to increase the graphitization degree of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), thereby improving their PMS activation capabilities. The Zn-modified CNTs exhibited a pseudo-first-order rate constant (k obs) of 0.2065 min−1, which is 7.9-fold and 59.0-fold higher than that of the thermally treated CNTs (0.015 min−1) and pristine CNTs (0.0035 min−1), respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the graphitization advancement led to an augmented contribution of the direct electron transfer (ETP) pathway for pollutant degradation, in conjunction with the contribution from singlet oxygen (1O2). Such pathway alteration can be owing to the increased electrical conductivity due to the presence of a highly conjugated π-electron system. Additionally, the practical application of the modified CNTs was rigorously evaluated under continuous treatment scenarios and in the presence of diverse anions such as Cl-, NO3 -, HCO3 -, and SO4 2-. The insights gained from this study are pivotal for the optimization of carbon-based catalysts for environmental remediation purposes.
