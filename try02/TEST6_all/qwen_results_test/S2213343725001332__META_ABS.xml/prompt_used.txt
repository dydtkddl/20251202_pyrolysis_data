You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Zinc-assisted pyrolysis for optimal graphitization of carbon nanotubes for boosted Fenton-like catalysis Carbon-based materials are extensively utilized as catalysts in peroxymonosulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PMS-AOPs). However, their basal active sites often exhibit inferior intrinsic activity, necessitating the development of facile modification techniques to enhance their catalytic efficacy in water purification. This study introduces a facile Zn-assisted pyrolysis strategy designed to increase the graphitization degree of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), thereby improving their PMS activation capabilities. The Zn-modified CNTs exhibited a pseudo-first-order rate constant (k obs) of 0.2065 min−1, which is 7.9-fold and 59.0-fold higher than that of the thermally treated CNTs (0.015 min−1) and pristine CNTs (0.0035 min−1), respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the graphitization advancement led to an augmented contribution of the direct electron transfer (ETP) pathway for pollutant degradation, in conjunction with the contribution from singlet oxygen (1O2). Such pathway alteration can be owing to the increased electrical conductivity due to the presence of a highly conjugated π-electron system. Additionally, the practical application of the modified CNTs was rigorously evaluated under continuous treatment scenarios and in the presence of diverse anions such as Cl-, NO3 -, HCO3 -, and SO4 2-. The insights gained from this study are pivotal for the optimization of carbon-based catalysts for environmental remediation purposes.
