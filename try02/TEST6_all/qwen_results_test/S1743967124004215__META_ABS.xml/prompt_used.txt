You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of pretreatment procedure, compositional feature and reaction condition on the devolatilization characteristics of biomass during pyrolysis process: A review Biomass is a plentiful and renewable energy source. Currently, the conversion of biomass into gaseous product, bio-oil, and biochar through pyrolysis is one of the significant technologies in the development of the energy recycling economy. The application research of three-phase products of biomass has gradually reached the commercial level. This paper reviewed the latest advancements in biomass pyrolysis technology, especially the impacts of pretreatment processes, types of biomass materials, and pyrolysis parameters on the products derived from biomass pyrolysis. Through detailed analyses of physical, chemical, physicochemical, and biological pretreatment technologies, the potential of different pretreatment methods for enhancing the quality of three-phase products was revealed. Moreover, the effects of different biomass materials on the pyrolysis products was also discussed systematically, elucidating how pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, reaction duration, gas atmosphere and pressure affecting the distribution and properties of pyrolysis products. Finally, this paper presented the challenges and future directions in the field of biomass thermal conversion, providing a theoretical foundation and technical support for the efficient conversion and utilization of biomass based solid waste.
