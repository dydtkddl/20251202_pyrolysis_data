You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene over Ga loaded HZSM-5 The effect of catalyst structure, acidity, and Ga addition of zeolites on the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was investigated by comparing PP cracking efficiency and product distribution properties in this study. Thermogravimetric analysis result indicated that HY(SiO2/Al2O3; 30) is the most effective catalyst lowering PP decomposition temperature, followed by Ga/HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(80), and HZSM-5(280). Meanwhile, Ga/HZSM-5(30) revealed the lowest apparent activation energy (Ea), 110 kJ/mol, than HY(30) (159 kJ/mol), and other HZSM-5 catalysts (122 ~ 172 kJ/mol), suggesting its high efficiency lowering Ea on PP pyrolysis. Py-GC/MS results also suggested that Ga/HZSM-5 produces the largest amount of aromatic hydrocarbons, followed by HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(80), HY(30), and HZSM-5(280). The increase of Ga/HZSM-5(30) amount on PP pyrolysis led the further decrease of Ea value and increase of aromatics production efficiency.
