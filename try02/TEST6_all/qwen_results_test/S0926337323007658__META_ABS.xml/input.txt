SMSI-induced charge transfer for selective hydrogenolysis of polyolefins The in-depth mechanism of the emerging Ru-catalyzed polyolefin hydrogenolysis remains unclear. Here, we overcome this challenge by constructing a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) system based on Ru/TiO2 catalysts. With the increase of SMSI intensity, electrons are transferred from the TiOx capping layer to the Ru species. This effect facilitates the key steps of hydrogenation/desorption, while having little effect on the dehydrogenation and C–C cracking elementary reactions. As a result, the catalyst with higher hydrogenation capability prone to proceed hydrogenation and desorption step, thus suppressing cascade C–C cracking and avoiding the production of low value methane. The catalyst with the strongest SMSI effect exhibits a liquid fuel yield of 89.4% at ∼100% solid conversion. The SMSI effect also enables the catalysts with superior stability, so it can also efficiently upcycle commercial polyolefins. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the effects of metal-support interactions on polyolefin hydrogenolysis and paves the way for catalyst design.
