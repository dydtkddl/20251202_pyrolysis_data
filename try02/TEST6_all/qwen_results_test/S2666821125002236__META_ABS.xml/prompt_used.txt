You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pathways towards sustainable aviation fuel production from waste biomass: A systematic review Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), derived from renewable resources, presents a practical alternative to Jet-A fuel by mitigating the ecological impact of aviation’s reliance on fossil fuel. Among the available feedstocks, waste biomass and waste oils present key advantages due to their abundance, sustainability potential, and waste valorization benefits. Despite continuous progress in SAF technologies, comprehensive assessments of catalytic routes and their efficiency in transforming waste-based feedstocks into aviation-grade fuels remain limited. This review addresses this gap by systematically evaluating recent studies (2019–2024) that investigate catalytic conversion and upgrading of waste-derived biomass toward SAF production. Selection of thermochemical processes including pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal liquefaction, or biological pathways, is driven by the physicochemical characteristics of the waste. These processes yield intermediates such as biocrude and bio-oils, undergo catalytic upgrading to meet aviation fuel standards. Zeolitic acids, sulfided NiMo or CoMo catalysts, noble-metal/oxide systems, and bifunctional or carbon-based catalysts drive hydroprocessing, deoxygenation, cracking, and isomerisation reactions, delivering high selectivity toward C8-C16fractions. Performance, mechanisms, and selectivity of these catalysts are critically assessed in relation to feedstock characteristics and operating conditions. Key factors such as metal-acid balance, hierarchical porosity, and tolerance to heteroatoms enhance catalytic efficiency. Persistent challenges including deactivation, coking, sintering, and feedstock impurities continue to limit long-term performance and scalability in waste-to-SAF applications. Mitigation strategies, including oxidative and resulfidation regeneration and support modification, have demonstrated improved stability. Moreover, waste-derived catalysts and circularity enhance process sustainability. Future work should align catalyst design with feedstock pretreatment and techno-economic assessments to scale sustainable and cost-effective waste-to-SAF pathways.
