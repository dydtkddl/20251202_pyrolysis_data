Assessment of pyrolysis product characteristics for valorisation of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) This study investigates pyrolysis of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) to valorise waste at different temperatures. An experimental setup is developed to study RDF valorisation. TGA is used to analyse the thermal degradation pattern of the complex RDF composition. The RDF sample is then pyrolysed at 400, 450, 500, and 550 °C at 10 °C/min. Pyrolysis of a unique RDF composition in the study produced oil, char, wax, and gas as the end products, characterised using Bomb Calorimetry, FTIR, BET, proximate and elemental analysis, and gas analysis techniques. The study demonstrates a threefold rise in hydrogen concentration in the product gas for an increase in pyrolysis temperature of 150 °C. The primary product of RDF pyrolysis is producer gas 20.79 ± 0.21 MJ/m3, followed by char (BET) surface area 15 ± 3.52 m2/g. The findings suggest that RDF pyrolysis is a viable waste valorisation process that complements sustainable energy production.
