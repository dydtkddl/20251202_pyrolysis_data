You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process modeling and assessment of waste polystyrene pyrolysis: Comparing catalytic and thermal methods The increasing use of plastics and growing societal demand for climate change mitigation have intensified efforts to recover monomers from polymers, such as polystyrene (PS). However, significant research gaps persist in the development of scalable processes and their commercial viability. This study suggests an optimal process design and operating conditions for PS depolymerization through a comprehensive design and assessment framework. A standardized process model was developed, integrating simulations and assessments performed using Aspen Plus, coupled with MATLAB, to assess economic and environmental feasibility. This evaluation was conducted by varying styrene monomer (SM) selectivity (40–80%) and light impurity ratio among total impurities (1–99%). Results revealed that catalytic pyrolysis, particularly using a base catalyst, demonstrates superior economic performance over thermal pyrolysis and other catalyst types. These findings were experimentally validated. The optimal process conditions, identified through techno-economic and life cycle assessment, were achieved with a K2O/SiO2 catalyst, which yielded 80.2% SM selectivity and 45% light impurity ratio. Furthermore, a comparison between thermal and catalytic pyrolysis under identical conditions demonstrated that the base catalytic pyrolysis proved more economical, with production costs of $1,437/ton SM compared to $2,431/ton SM for thermal pyrolysis. Environmentally, base catalytic pyrolysis showed a low global warming potential of 1.34 tonCO2eq/ton SM, compared to 2.15 tonCO2eq/ton SM for thermal pyrolysis. This research provides a critical foundation for the industrial feasibility of PS depolymerization by identifying optimal catalyst conditions and operating parameters.
