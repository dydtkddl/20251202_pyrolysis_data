You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dual-combustion chamber cycle utilizing biomass and geothermal energy: A comprehensive economic analysis and multi-objective optimization for enhanced multi-generation This paper proposes a novel multi-generation system comprising a digester, a gasifier, a geothermal unit, a Kalina cycle, a multi-effect desalination, a flash desalination, and an organic flash cycle. Energy, exergy, and exergo-economic analyses are performed for the system, yielding a second law efficiency of 31.97 %, total power generation of 5416 kW, a heating rate of 584.6 kW, cooling rate of 25.34 kW, freshwater production of 72.36 kg/s, and total exergy destruction of 12,273.44 kW. The highest exergy destruction occurs in the multi-effect desalination subsystem at 4546 kW (37 % of the total), followed by the digester at 2798.26 kW (22.9 % of the total). The unit exergy cost of the system products is calculated as $31.88/GJ. With a freshwater price of $1.5/m3 and an electricity price of $ 0.14/kWh, the payback period is obtained as 5.44 years. Using the Gray Wolf algorithm, multi-objective optimizations are performed for two scenarios resulting in optimal values for the first scenario with 33.54 % second law efficiency, 6538 kW power generation, and 75.56 kg/s freshwater production. For the second scenario, the second law efficiency is 33.96 %, with a power output of 6398 kW and a total unit exergy cost of the products amounting to $33.59/GJ.
