Co-gasification of beech-wood and polyethylene in a fluidized-bed reactor The co-gasification of beech-wood and polyethylene has been investigated in a lab-scale fluidised-bed reactor in the presence of four different types of bed materials (silica sand, olivine, Na-Y zeolite and ZSM-5 zeolite). ZSM-5 zeolite is very effective as a catalytic bed material in fluidized-bed reactor for wood-only gasification and co-gasification in terms of high hydrogen production and CGE. Na-Y zeolite is more effective compared with ZSM-5 zeolite in co-gasification of the beech-wood and polyethylene process. The catalytic activity in co-gasification of beech-wood and polyethylene can be ranked accordingly: Na-Y zeolite > ZSM-5 zeolite > olivine. In general, higher amounts of steam injected in the fluidized-bed reactor and more polyethylene would lead to higher hydrogen production in the co-gasification process.
