Extended shelf-life of biodegradable poly(butylene succinate-co-carbonate)/chitin nanowhisker-based bags Biodegradable plastics are regarded as a solution for the plastic waste challenge that it does not decompose and accumulates in the ecosystem. However, two notable drawbacks of biodegradable plastics are their low resistance to humid atmospheres, which results in a shorter shelf life, and their limited ability to decompose in soil at room temperature. This study aimed to develop a disposable bag that offers a suitable shelf life along with effective biodegradation in soil after disposal. To achieve this, poly(butylene succinate-co-carbonate) (PBSC) and its nanocomposites with chitin nanowhiskers (ChNs) were synthesized on a pilot scale, processed into disposable bags by blown extrusion. The results were compared with that of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS). The PBSC/ChN composite retained 90 % of its tensile properties for 60 days under humid storage conditions of 30 °C and 90 % relative humidity. Unlike esters, carbonates do not form acids upon hydrolysis, avoiding autocatalysis, while the amino group in ChN can neutralize acids, increasing hydrolysis resistance. After disposal, the bags showed enhanced degradation rates in soil at 25 °C because of their microbial affinity. PBSC/ChN nanocomposites can effectively serve as practical biodegradable disposable bags with the desired shelf life.
