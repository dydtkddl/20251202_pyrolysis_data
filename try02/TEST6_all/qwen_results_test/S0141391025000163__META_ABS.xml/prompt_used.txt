You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Extended shelf-life of biodegradable poly(butylene succinate-co-carbonate)/chitin nanowhisker-based bags Biodegradable plastics are regarded as a solution for the plastic waste challenge that it does not decompose and accumulates in the ecosystem. However, two notable drawbacks of biodegradable plastics are their low resistance to humid atmospheres, which results in a shorter shelf life, and their limited ability to decompose in soil at room temperature. This study aimed to develop a disposable bag that offers a suitable shelf life along with effective biodegradation in soil after disposal. To achieve this, poly(butylene succinate-co-carbonate) (PBSC) and its nanocomposites with chitin nanowhiskers (ChNs) were synthesized on a pilot scale, processed into disposable bags by blown extrusion. The results were compared with that of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS). The PBSC/ChN composite retained 90 % of its tensile properties for 60 days under humid storage conditions of 30 °C and 90 % relative humidity. Unlike esters, carbonates do not form acids upon hydrolysis, avoiding autocatalysis, while the amino group in ChN can neutralize acids, increasing hydrolysis resistance. After disposal, the bags showed enhanced degradation rates in soil at 25 °C because of their microbial affinity. PBSC/ChN nanocomposites can effectively serve as practical biodegradable disposable bags with the desired shelf life.
