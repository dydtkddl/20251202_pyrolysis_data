You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Leads and hurdles to sustainable microbial bioplastic production Indiscriminate usage, disposal and recalcitrance of petroleum-based plastics have led to its accumulation leaving a negative impact on the environment. Bioplastics, particularly microbial bioplastics serve as an ecologically sustainable solution to nullify the negative impacts of plastics. Microbial production of biopolymers like Polyhydroxyalkanoates, Polyhydroxybutyrates and Polylactic acid using renewable feedstocks as well as industrial wastes have gained momentum in the recent years. The current study outlays types of bioplastics, their microbial sources and applications in various fields. Scientific evidence on bioplastics has suggested a unique range of applications such as industrial, agricultural and medical applications. Though diverse microorganisms such as Alcaligenes latus, Burkholderia sacchari, Micrococcus species, Lactobacillus pentosus, Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Rhizobium sp., Enterobacter sp., Escherichia sp., Azototobacter sp., Protomonas sp., Cupriavidus sp., Halomonas sp., Saccharomyces sp., Kluyveromyces sp., and Ralstonia sp. are known to produce bioplastics, the industrial production of bioplastics is still challenging. Thus this paper also provides deep insights on the advancements made to maximise production of bioplastics using different approaches such as metabolic engineering, rDNA technologies and multitude of cultivation strategies. Finally, the constraints to microbial bioplastic production and the future directions of research are briefed. Hence the present review emphasizes on the importance of using bioplastics as a sustainable alternative to petroleum based plastic products to diminish environmental pollution.
