You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Macropore-tailoring of SiOC by photopolymerization-assisted solidification templating for monolithic catalyst supports Freeze-cast, polysiloxane-derived silicon oxycarbides (SiOCs) were investigated as monolithic catalyst supports. The monoliths were prepared by photopolymerization-assisted solidification templating, a specific variant of unidirectional freeze-casting. Macropore morphologies templated from unary and binary structure-directing solvents of tert-butyl alcohol and cyclohexane exhibiting a eutectic composition and melting points below –20 °C were stabilized by photopolymerization, these conditions not being accessible for conventional polycondensation-based crosslinking of polysiloxane. Screening of binary solvents revealed novel pore morphologies close to the eutectic composition, where bimodal macroporosity (21 µm, 4 µm) was obtained from excess tert-butyl alcohol. The observed overall high permeability (k1 = 10−11-10−12 m2) renders freeze-cast SiOC interesting as an innovative support material for structured catalysts. The monoliths were compatible with the wet impregnation technique to deposit active Nickel sites for successful catalytic conversion tests employing CO2 methanation as a model reaction. Here, distinct differences in CO2 conversion were observed between dendritically and prismatically structured pores, with the former achieving significantly increased conversions of up to 69 % at overall high CH4 selectivity.
