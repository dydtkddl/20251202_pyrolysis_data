Upcycling PET waste into carbon quantum dots as flame retardant of PET for closed-loop recycling Recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into high value-added products is challenging yet crucial for sustainable development. Here, we developed a clean, efficient, solvent-free solid-phase pyrolysis method to upcycle PET waste into carbon quantum dots (rPET-CQDs) with a single batch yield of up to 1 kg, overcoming the low-yield limitation hindering commercialization. Life cycle assessment (LCA) for the preparation of rPET-CQDs showed significant energy savings and environmental benefits, highlighting the potential of this approach for sustainable upcycling of PET waste. Furthermore, the rPET-CQDs were polymerized with terephthalic acid (PTA) and ethylene glycol (EG) to synthesis flame-retardant copolyester (rPET-CQDs-PET), enabling a closed-loop recycling pathway of PET waste. At the 2.0 wt% doping level, the limiting oxygen index of rPET-CQDs-PET increased to 31 %, while the peak heat release rate decreased by 20.17 % and elongation at break increased by 52.83 % compared to PET. Flame retardant mechanistic analysis revealed that rPET-CQDs facilitate the carbonization of PET, forming continuous and dense carbon layer, thereby enhancing flame retardancy.
