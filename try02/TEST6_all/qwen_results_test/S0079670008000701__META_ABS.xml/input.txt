A review on polymer–layered silicate nanocomposites This review reports recent advances in the field of polymer–layered silicate nanocomposites. These materials have attracted both academic and industrial attention because they exhibit dramatic improvement in properties at very low filler contents. Herein, the structure, preparation and properties of polymer–layered silicate nanocomposites are discussed in general, and detailed examples are also drawn from the scientific literature.
