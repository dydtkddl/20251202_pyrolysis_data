You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation of fountain height in a shallow rectangular spouted bed using digital image analysis The formation of a fountain is a unique phenomenon of spouted beds, which plays a significant role in the reactor design as well as the physical and chemical efficiency of the whole system. The present work investigates the fountain height (Hf) behavior in a rectangular spouted bed (30.2 mm × 101.6 mm) using four different kinds of particles classified in both Geldart groups D (Nylon and Alumina) and B (Glass beads (GB) and High density polyethylene (HDPE)), which is intended as a gap-bridging attempt, given the fact that most of the published fountain height studies were conducted in the cylindrical bed geometry. First, with the determination of Hf by systematic image processing methods, the effects of different variables including, superficial gas velocity (Ug), nozzle size (Deqn), and initial static bed height (H0) on Hf of the Geldart D and B particles are addressed. Secondly, because of the intrinsic periodical behavior of the absolute fountain height (Hfa, i.e. the vertical distance between the fountain surface to the bed bottom), the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to characterize the variation of the Hfa for the four particle types. The period of particles’ entry into the spout and the “residence time” of particles in the fountain region are proposed as two possible factors that affect the fountain frequency. Finally, correlations to predict the Hf for both Geldart D and B particles are developed respectively, based on the discussion of different influence factors and frequency analysis. The correlation developed for Geldart B particles indicates that the effect of the nozzle size (Di) can be neglected when the ratio of particle size (dp) to nozzle size (Di) is less than 0.1. The predicted values show good agreement with the experimental data in the present study. In addition, the employment of the equivalent cross-sectional area diameters of the nozzle and rectangular column, namely Di and Dc, ensures the potential extension of the application of the developed correlations to cylindrical spouted beds.
