Catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane: Intrinsic parameter estimation and validation Ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis is a potential process for on-board hydrogen generation. This paper presents isothermal hydrogen release rate measurements of dilute AB (1wt%) hydrolysis in the presence of carbon supported ruthenium catalyst (Ru/C). The ranges of investigated catalyst particle sizes and temperature were 20–181μm and 26–56°C, respectively. The obtained rate data included both kinetic and diffusion-controlled regimes, where the latter was evaluated using the catalyst effectiveness approach. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model was adopted to interpret the data, with intrinsic kinetic and diffusion parameters determined by a nonlinear fitting algorithm. The AB hydrolysis was found to have an activation energy 60.4kJmol−1, pre-exponential factor 1.36×1010 mol(kg-cat)−1 s−1, adsorption energy −32.5kJmol−1, and effective mass diffusion coefficient 2×10−10 m2 s−1. These parameters, obtained under dilute AB conditions, were validated by comparing measurements with simulations of AB consumption rates during the hydrolysis of concentrated AB solutions (5–20wt%), and also with the axial temperature distribution in a 0.5kW continuous-flow packed-bed reactor.
