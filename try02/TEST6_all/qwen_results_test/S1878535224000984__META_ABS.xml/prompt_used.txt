You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic verification and Comsol modeling of the Diels-Alder reaction of conjugated pentadiene with maleic anhydride in a continuous flow capillary reactor Synthesis of 3/4-methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride was carried out by the Diels-Alder reaction in a continuous flow capillary reactor. The efficient liquid–liquid reaction of pentadiene with molten maleic anhydride provided a theoretical basis for replacing the conventional batch reaction process. Different inner diameter sizes of the channel tubes were adjusted in the range of 0.50 ∼ 2.00 mm to find the optimal size to match the strong exothermic reaction. Under the capillary channel size of 0.8 mm, the conversion rate of C5 and MA reached 100 % when nC5: nMA = 1.08:1 at 65 °C for 8 min. The D-A reaction process is accompanied by the autopolymerization of diolefin in the batch reactor. Our results showed that choosing a continuous flow capillary reactor of appropriate size can directly improve the selectivity of the reaction and the quality of the product. The accurate reaction rate constant and activation energy were obtained by establishing a kinetic model, and the effects of temperature, reaction time and pipe diameter were designed using Comsol software.
