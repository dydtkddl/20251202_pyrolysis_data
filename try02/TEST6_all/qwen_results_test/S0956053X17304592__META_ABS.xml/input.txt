Fluid dynamics model on fluidized bed gasifier using agro-industrial biomass as fuel The present study shows the experimental and numerical results of thermal gasification of biomass, on the energy potential of agro-industrial waste from the Portalegre region. Gasification tests were performed in a pilot-scale fluidized bed gasifier, in order to study the behavior of peach stones and miscanthus to investigate the effect of gasification temperatures at 750°C, 800°C and 850°C at a constant biomass flow rate of 45kg/h. In order to optimize the operating conditions of the biomass gasification process, a numerical model is developed namely COMMENT code. This model is a computer model of two dimensions describing the biomass gasification processes in a fluidized bed gasifier using peach stone and miscanthus as fuel. Both phases, solid and gaseous, were described using an Eulerian-Eulerian approach exchanging mass, energy, and momentum. The numerical model results are then compared with experimental results. The produced results show the impact of the increased temperature in the calorific value of the syngas. The tests carried out at 750°C shown an increase in CO2 and N2 and a decrease of CO in the range of 5% comparing to the tests carried out at 850°C. In addition, increased temperature favors a decrease in tar production in thermal gasification process. Numerical results shows to be in good agreement with the experimental data.
