You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparing hydrogen-rich syngas by chemical looping reforming of wheat straw pyrolysis volatiles via NiFe2O4@SBA-15 oxygen carrier For achieving green and low-carbon production of hydrogen-rich syngas from biomass, a nano-NiFe2O4 oxygen carrier embedded in molecular sieve was developed for the chemical-looping reforming of wheat straw pyrolysis volatiles. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the feasible reforming temperature should exceed 548 ℃. The optimal process parameters were established through systematic experimental studies combined with response surface methodology. The embedded strategy remarkably enhanced partial oxidation performance, resulting in a 43.3% increase in syngas yield, 98.7% conversion of volatile macromolecules, and 72.1% syngas selectivity under optimal conditions. Steam introduction effectively suppressed carbon deposition and enhanced hydrogen yield, while it is unfavorable to transforming macromolecular components compared to dry reforming conditions. Ten cycles showed that the oxygen carrier had excellent cycle stability, the volatiles conversion was 97.5–99.5%, and syngas selectivity was 70.3–72.7%, realizing the efficient conversion of volatiles. It provided necessary data for the green and low-carbon preparation of hydrogen-rich syngas and the development and design of oxygen carriers.
