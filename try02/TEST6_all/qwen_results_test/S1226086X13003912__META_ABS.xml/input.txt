Synthesis and characterization of graphene and carbon nanotubes: A review on the past and recent developments Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have built broad interest in most areas of science and engineering because of their extraordinary physical, mechanical, thermal and optical properties. Graphene is a two-dimensional one-atom-thick planar sheet of sp2-bonded carbon atoms while CNTs are a cylindrical nanostructure which composed entirely of sp2-bonded carbon atoms as well. This review presents and discusses the past and current advancement of synthesis and characterization of graphene and CNTs. The review also concludes with a brief summary and an outlook on the challenges and future prospects in the growth of graphene and CNTs.
