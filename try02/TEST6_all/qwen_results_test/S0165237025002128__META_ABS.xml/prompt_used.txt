You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Converting polyolefin mixtures into fuels via a closed-system pyrolysis process This work examined the effects of the experimental conditions in an oxygen-free closed system on the pyrolysis process of a polyolefin mixture (PO) composed of 40 % medium-density polyethylene (MDPE), 35 % low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and 25 % polypropylene (PP). The goal was to get the best yields and quality of gasoline and diesel-type fuels. The effect of the autogenic pressure was studied by varying the temperature (400, 425, and 450 °C) and reaction time (1, 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes). The effect of the initial pressure (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 bar) was studied at 425 °C and 60 minutes. The products obtained were gas, oil, and wax. The presence of coke was not observed. The preferred product for fuel production was oil. The temperature of the pyrolysis process decreased to 400–450 °C in an oxygen-free closed system from a usual 550 °C when the procedure was conducted in an open system. Gas and liquid chemical composition and simulated distillation behaviors were also studied in both processes. In the autogenic pressure process, the optimal variables for higher yield and quality of the fuel-like products were 425 °C, 30–45 min, and up to 33 bar. The effect of the initial pressure showed that higher pressures did not present an advantage in the PO cracking process. While the autogenic pressure was the result of an increasing gas formation and therefore presented an important effect on the products obtained, higher initial pressures (above 10 bar) seemed not to be required for the increment in the yield or quality of the products.
