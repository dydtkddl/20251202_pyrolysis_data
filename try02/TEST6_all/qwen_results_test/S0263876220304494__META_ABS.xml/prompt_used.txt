You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Partially coated TiO2 on Al2O3 membrane for high water flux and photodegradation by novel filtration strategy in photocatalytic membrane reactors Partially coated TiO2 (pc-TiO2) layer on the porous Al2O3 membrane substrate was developed by using low-cost poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) to generate interstitial voids to be applied in a photocatalytic membrane reactor for the treatment of organic dye contaminant. The combination of dead-end filtration with cross-flow filtration under intermittent UV irradiation onto a developed composite ceramic membrane was suggested to reduce the membrane fouling effectively. Our study showed that the water flux and anti-fouling properties of the pc-TiO2/Al2O3 composite membrane was much higher than those of uniformly coated TiO2 (uc-TiO2)/Al2O3. Cross-flow membrane filtration provided a much greater synergistic impact on photocatalytic activity for both uc- and pc-TiO2/Al2O3 composite membranes than Al2O3 bare membrane substrate. Less fouling caused by hydrodynamic shear along the membrane surface is thought to be associated with better accessibility of UV irradiation by the reactive surface of the TiO2/Al2O3 composite membrane, promoting the photodegradation of the organic dye contaminant in water filtration.
