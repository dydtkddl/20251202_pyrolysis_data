Catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic pyrolyzed and biooil over Ni-modified ZSM-5 hierarchical structures Hierarchical designing of (10 wt% - 70 wt%) nickel over HZSM-5 zeolite was done using wet-impregnation method. The material formation was established by XRD, BET, TPD and TEM studies. Optimization of reaction parameters for mixture of LDPE derived oil and waste cooking oil was found to be 450 °C, 4.6 h−1, 1:1, and 2nd h. The oxygenated and aliphatic molecules from catalytic co-pyrolysis were effectively transformed, resulting in an elevated selectivity to BTX (as high as 29.7%) and an increased relative selectivity of aromatics to the highest of 97.3%. Despite the comparatively short carbon chains of LBF components, activating the co-pyrolysis products with Ni/HZSM-5 (50 wt %) was found to be helpful in improving subsequent aromatization reactions with biomass pyrolysis intermediates. This work offers a new technique for the co-utilization of abundant biooil and most unused PPL with additional value, which helps to produce renewable chemicals while lowering environmental pollution.
