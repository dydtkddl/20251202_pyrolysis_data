You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization and screening of process parameters for the robust co-pyrolytic study of waste motor oil and rice stubble toward sustainable waste-to-fuel generation The current study explores the co-pyrolysis of waste motor oil (WMO) and rice stubble in a designed lab-scale pyrolyzer to produce alternative energy fuels. The parameter screening was followed by optimization utilizing the Box-Behnken design (BBD). Reactor temperature (TR), mixing ratio (M), and holding time (t) affected the co-pyro-oil yield substantially. A maximum co-pyro-oil yield of 90.3% was achieved at a TR = 485 °C, t = 12.5 min, and M = 5% rice stubble to waste motor oil, which was further characterized and compared with the commercial diesel fuel properties. The highest research octane number of 76.15 was obtained for the co-pyro-oil (Co-PO), followed by the pyro-oil generated from only waste motor oil (POWMO). Consequently, the paraffin content increased to 64.34 wt% from 27.66 wt % for PO RS. The carbon number varied from C7–C17 for PO WMO and Co–Po, aligning with the diesel fuel requirements. Furthermore, a substantial enrichment in the physio-chemical properties of the produced Co-PO with reduced moisture content and enhancement in higher heating value (HHV) was also noticed. Hence, the generated Co-PO could be utilized as transport-grade fuel.
