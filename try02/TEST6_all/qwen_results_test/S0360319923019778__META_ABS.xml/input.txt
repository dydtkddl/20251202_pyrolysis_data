Influence of process parameters on direct solar-thermal hydrogen and graphite production via methane pyrolysis Current hydrogen and carbon production technologies emit massive amounts of CO2 that threaten Earth's climate stability. Here, a new solar-thermal methane pyrolysis process involving flow through a fibrous carbon medium to produce hydrogen gas and high-value graphitic carbon product is presented and experimentally quantified. A 10 kWe solar simulator is used to instigate the methane decomposition reaction with direct irradiation in a custom solar reactor. From localized solar heating of fibrous medium, the process reaches steady-state thermal and chemical operation from room temperature within the first minute of irradiation. Additionally, no measurable carbon deposition occurs outside the fibrous medium, leaving the graphitic product in a form readily extractable from the solar reactor. Parametric variations of methane inlet flow rate (10–2000 sccm), solar power (0.92–2.49 kW) and peak flux (1.3–3.5 MW/m2), operating pressure (1.33–40 kPa), and medium thickness (0.36–9.6 mm) are presented, with methane conversion varying from 22% to 96%.
