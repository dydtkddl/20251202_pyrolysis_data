You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design and cold flow testing of a Gas-Solid Vortex Reactor demonstration unit for biomass fast pyrolysis Innovative gas-solid fluidized beds with process intensification capabilities are among the most promising alternatives for the current state of the art in the chemical industry. In the present work the advantages of such a reactor that sustains a rotating fluidized bed with gas-solid slip velocities much higher than those in conventional fluidized beds are illustrated computationally and experimentally. A Gas-Solid Vortex Reactor (GSVR) demonstration unit is designed to operate at typical biomass fast pyrolysis conditions targeting the production of chemicals and fuels from renewable feedstocks. For the demonstration unit preheated N2 supplies the thermal energy required by the fast pyrolysis process but alternative sources can also be evaluated. A broad range of operation conditions in the 80mm diameter and 15mm height GSVR can be evaluated: N2 mass flow rates of 5–10gs−1 and biomass feed mass flow rates of 0.14–1.4gs−1. Particle-free and particulate flow experiments confirmed that the carrier gas is evenly distributed around the GSVR cylindrical chamber as anticipated by computational fluid dynamic simulations. The latter also supported the inclusion of a profiled bottom end wall and a diverging exhaust. Cold flow experiments with biomass confirmed that the GSVR sustains a rotating fluidized bed with average bed height of 10mm and solids azimuthal velocities of 6–7ms−1.
