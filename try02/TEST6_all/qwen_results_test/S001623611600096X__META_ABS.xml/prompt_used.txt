You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of liquid hydrocarbons from rice crop wastes mixtures by co-pyrolysis and co-hydropyrolysis The aim of this work was the valorisation of rice crop wastes mixtures by pyrolysis to produce liquids to be used as bio-fuels or as raw bio-materials. The effect of waste mixtures composition on liquids yield and composition was studied. Rice husk (RH) and straw (RS) were pyrolysed with polyethylene (PE), the main plastic used in rice production process. Polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) were also studied, due to their presence in great amounts in solid wastes. The rise of rice husk amount in PE blends led to a decrease in the conversion of co-pyrolysis (pyrolysis of blends of biomass rice and plastic wastes) and to a reduction of liquid yields. Thus, the blend with 20% (w/w) of rice wastes was selected for further studies. No great changes were observed in the results when husk was replaced by straw, which is advantageous for the pyrolysis process. However, the same was not observed for the type of plastic waste. PS decreased total conversion and the formation of gases and liquids and increased aromatic compounds content in liquids. Some tests were done using hydrogen (hydropyrolysis) instead of nitrogen (pyrolysis) with the aim of improving liquids quality due to the presence of hydrogen in the reaction medium. Different pathways were analysed: (I) co-pyrolysis; (II) co-hydropyrolysis; (III) co-pyrolysis followed by hydropyrolysis and (IV) hydropyrolysis of co-pyrolysis liquids. Co-pyrolysis followed by hydropyrolysis was not favourable for further solids conversion and led to a great increase of gases. Co-hydropyrolysis led to the highest conversion, as both gas and total liquid yields increased.
