You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation study of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) under inert and oxidative environments Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of polyethylene terephthalate obtained from waste soft drink bottles (PET-SDB) was carried out under inert (nitrogen) as well as reactive (synthetic air) environments to evaluate the degradation behaviour and degradation kinetics. Non-isothermal TGA experiments at heating rates of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 50 °C/min were performed and the kinetic parameters such as activation energy (Eα) and pre-exponential factor (Aα) were determined at various extent of conversions using advance isoconversional (AIC) method. Criados’ master plot technique established F1 (first order) as possible reaction model ( f α ) for both inert and oxygenated non-isothermal TGA data. Under inert (N2) environment a residue accumulation of around 20% was observed whereas complete conversion of PET-SDB occurred in oxygenated environment. The activation energy values were found in the range of 203–355 kJ/mol and 145–218 kJ/mol for inert and oxygenated environment respectively. Isothermal TGA data at various temperatures were analysed for the estimation of kinetic parameters. In the considered range of conversions, the range of activation energy obtained for multiple isothermal TGA data was found in the range of 196–217 kJ/mol.
