You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions from aqueous solution using sulphonated waste polystyrene We report the use of sulphonated waste polystyrene (SWPS) in the removal of heavy metal ions from water. Waste polystyrene (WPS) comprising of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) collected from dump sites in Harare were activated through sulphonation to produce a cation-exchange resin. The presence of the sulphonic group was studied with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was used to determine the concentrations of residual metals (Zn2+, Pb2+) after batch adsorption experiments. Sulphonated HIPS reduced Zn2+ from 80 to 38.3mg/L compared to 10–1.6mg/L for sulphonated EPS. Similarly, sulphonated HIPS reduced Pb2+ from 100 to 33mg/L compared to 80–50.3mg/L for sulphonated EPS. The adsorption data followed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second order kinetics. Maximum adsorption capacities as quantified by the Langmuir parameter q max for HIPS was 5.01mg/g, EPS 0.38mg/g for Zn2+ and HIPS 6.80mg/g, EPS 0.68 mg/g for Pb2+. The data were analysed using pseudo first order and pseudo second order Lagergren equation and the adsorption kinetics of the metals Pb2+ and Zn2+ was found to follow the pseudo second order kinetic model. Interpretation of the sorption data in terms of separation factor (S F) suggested that the removal of Pb2+ and Zn2+ from water mainly occurred through chemisorption.
