You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The potential of subcritical water as a “green” method for the extraction and modification of pectin: A critical review Subcritical water is a “green” method of extraction and modification of pectin being explored in recent times. While the conventional acid extraction degrades the side chains and produces homogalacturonan (HG)-rich pectic polysaccharides, subcritical water extraction preserved the hairy region, namely the rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) region of the pectin. However, higher temperatures (usually greater than 160 °C) degraded the RG-I and HG motifs, producing pectic oligosaccharides. A high selectivity towards pectic polysaccharides with a low protein content was observed during extraction by subcritical water. This can be majorly attributed to the heat-induced denaturation of proteins. Although the bioactive and emulsifying properties were more remarkable for subcritical water-extracted pectin, the rheological properties such as elasticity were negatively impacted. Apart from extraction, subcritical water can also be employed to aid the breakdown of pectic polysaccharides into oligosaccharides. The addition of several organic acids in subcritical water can help form pectic fragments, which are otherwise possible only by adding a cocktail of enzymes. For instance, carboxylic acids in subcritical water media can have a similar action to endo-polygalacturonase on the homogalacturonan backbone. It is worthwhile to note that intense extraction or modification conditions can form advanced glycation end products, which are undesirable and should be monitored throughout the modification process. Several thermodynamic and kinetic models can be employed to predict the breakdown of the pectin structure in subcritical conditions. Finally, this study suggests a strategy for obtaining the optimum process parameters, namely, temperature, duration, and the liquid:solid ratio for achieving maximum yield and the desired structure of the pectic polysaccharide.
