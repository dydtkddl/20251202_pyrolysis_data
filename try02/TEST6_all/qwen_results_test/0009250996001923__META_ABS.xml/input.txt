Development of supported thin palladium membrane and application to enhancement of propane aromatization on Ga-silicate catalyst Palladium acetate was sublimed at reduced pressure at 400°C and was evacuated through the porous wall of an α-alumina support tube. A thin palladium membrane was thus formed in the macropores due to chemical vapor deposition. The palladium membrane showed a hydrogen permeance of 10−6 mol·m−2·s−1·Pa−1 and a hydrogen/nitrogen permselectivity higher than 1000. Further, gallium-silicate catalyst ( Si Ga = 40) was synthesized via an alkoxide method, and the membrane was coaxially fixed in a tubular reactor in which the catalyst particles were packed. Aromatization of propane was performed at 500–600°C, and the hydrogen evolved was continuously removed from the system. Propane conversion and aromatics selectivity were increased by decreasing hydrogen partial pressure by the installation of the membrane.
