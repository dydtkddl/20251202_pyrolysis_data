Co-pyrolysis of plastic polymers and biomass: Effect of beech wood/plastic ratio and temperature on enhanced oil production in a tubular pyrolyzer This study aimed to investigate the co-pyrolysis of beech wood, with polypropylene, high- and low-density polyethylene, polystyrene, and their mixture as synergic effects on liquid oil production inside a tubular reactor under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The liquid oil recovered was analyzed using gas chromatography methods. Beech wood to plastic ratio and operating temperature were varied. Results showed that for beech wood polystyrene mix an increase of aromatic compounds compared to the theoretical value. The oil was mainly constituted of aromatics of about 68 wt% for the 50-50 mixture. The liquid oil experiences a great reduction in the oxygen content from 41 wt% (beech wood) to just 8 wt% for the polystyrene-beech wood 50-50 mixture. The oil also exhibited a high heating value of 37 MJ/kg with high aromatic content making the oil suitable to be blended with high mass proportions in the gasoline pool. In contrast, a negative synergy was observed between beech wood and polyolefins leading to an increase in acids and carbohydrates of 7 wt% to 10 wt% for polyethylene and polypropylene respectively compared with the theoretical value. Regarding the temperature variation between 450 and 600 °C, no remarkable change in oxygenated compounds was observed.
