You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of plastic polymers and biomass: Effect of beech wood/plastic ratio and temperature on enhanced oil production in a tubular pyrolyzer This study aimed to investigate the co-pyrolysis of beech wood, with polypropylene, high- and low-density polyethylene, polystyrene, and their mixture as synergic effects on liquid oil production inside a tubular reactor under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The liquid oil recovered was analyzed using gas chromatography methods. Beech wood to plastic ratio and operating temperature were varied. Results showed that for beech wood polystyrene mix an increase of aromatic compounds compared to the theoretical value. The oil was mainly constituted of aromatics of about 68 wt% for the 50-50 mixture. The liquid oil experiences a great reduction in the oxygen content from 41 wt% (beech wood) to just 8 wt% for the polystyrene-beech wood 50-50 mixture. The oil also exhibited a high heating value of 37 MJ/kg with high aromatic content making the oil suitable to be blended with high mass proportions in the gasoline pool. In contrast, a negative synergy was observed between beech wood and polyolefins leading to an increase in acids and carbohydrates of 7 wt% to 10 wt% for polyethylene and polypropylene respectively compared with the theoretical value. Regarding the temperature variation between 450 and 600 °C, no remarkable change in oxygenated compounds was observed.
