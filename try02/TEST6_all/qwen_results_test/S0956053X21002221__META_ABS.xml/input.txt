Catalytic pyrolysis of petroleum-based and biodegradable plastic waste to obtain high-value chemicals The petroleum-based plastics, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP), and the biodegradable plastic, polylactide (PLA) were processed by thermal and catalytic pyrolysis to investigate their suitability as feedstock for chemical recycling. The influence of pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C) and catalyst (zeolite, spent FCC, and MgO catalyst) on the pyrolysis liquid composition and yield was studied. The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 °C. Spent FCC catalyst produced mostly propanoic acid at 400 °C but at 600 °C, L-lactic acid became the most abundant compound.
