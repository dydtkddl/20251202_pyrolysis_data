You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on methanolytic depolymerization of PET with supercritical methanol for chemical recycling Methanolytic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was carried out in a stainless stirred autoclave at temperatures of 523–543 K, pressures of 8.5–14.0 MPa, and with a weight ratio of methanol to PET from 3 to 8. The solid products mainly composed of dimethyl terephthalate and small amounts of methyl-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, bis (hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, dimers and oligomers were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The liquid products composed of ethylene glycol and methanol were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). It was found that both the yield of dimethyl terephthalate and the degree of PET depolymerization were seriously influenced by the temperature, weight ratio of methanol to PET, and reaction time, whilst the pressure has insignificant influence when it is above the critical point of methanol. The optimal depolymerization conditions are temperature of 533–543 K, pressure of 9.0–11.0 MPa, and the weight ratio (methanol to PET) from 6 to 8. The depolymerization of several PET wastes collected from the Chinese market was investigated under the optimal conditions.
