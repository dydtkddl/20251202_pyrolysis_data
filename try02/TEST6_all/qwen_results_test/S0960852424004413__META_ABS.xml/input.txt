Biomass to green surfactants: Microwave-assisted transglycosylation of wheat bran for alkyl glycosides production Depolymerization of carbohydrate biomass using a long-chain alcohol (transglycosylation) to produce alkyl glycoside-based bio-surfactants has been gaining industrial interest. This study introduces microwave-assisted transglycosylation in transforming wheat bran, a substantial agricultural side stream, into these valuable compounds. Compared to traditional heating, microwave-assisted processing significantly enhances the product yield by 53 % while reducing the reaction time by 72 %, achieving a yield of 29 % within 5 h. This enhancement results from the microwave's capacity to activate intermolecular hydrogen and glycosidic bonds, thereby facilitating transglycosylation. Life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis demonstrate the benefits of microwave heating in reducing energy consumption by 42 %, CO2 emissions by 56 %, and equipment, operational and production costs by 44 %, 35 % and 30 %, respectively. The study suggests that microwave heating is a promising approach for efficiently producing bio-surfactants from agricultural wastes, with potential cost reductions and environmental benefits that could enhance industrial biomass conversion processes.
