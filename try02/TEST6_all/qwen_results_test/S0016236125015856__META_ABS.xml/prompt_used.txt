You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of sensors for the real-time detection of catalytic methane pyrolysis Methane pyrolysis has been a topic of research in both energy technology and aerospace propulsion. Various aspects such as heat transfer, catalytic materials and chemical kinetics as well as carbon deposition behaviour have been in focus. However, the temporal behaviour of pyrolysis and carbon deposition has received relatively little attention. Considering the effect of maintenance on programme costs, it is important to have sensors with good time resolution both in the laboratory and in operational systems. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the efficacy of real-time sensors that have the potential for integration into systems with real-world applications. Speed of Sound (SoS) transducers and Thermal Conductivity Gauges (TCG) have the potential to produce high-quality measurements at relatively low cost and in a compact form factor; however, they have not yet been demonstrated in this research area. Therefore, the current work assesses their performance compared to gas chromatography (GC), using a newly developed experimental setup. It is shown, for the conditions tested, that real-time and in-flow SoS and TCG sensors can attain measurement quality comparable to that of the GC used; however, this performance is implementation dependent. Specifically, PCB based TCG and Time-of-Flight based SoS measurements are found to be highly effective in capturing the dynamic characteristics of the methane pyrolysis process. Although the current indication is promising, further work is necessary to test the approach under representative operational conditions specific to, for example, aerospace propulsion applications.
