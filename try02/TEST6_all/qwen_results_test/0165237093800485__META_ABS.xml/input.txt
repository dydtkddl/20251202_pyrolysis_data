Fluid bed pyrolysis of anhydride-hardened epoxy resins and polyether-polyurethane by the Hamburg process The aim of the research was to utilize wastes of semirigid polyether-polyurethane foam, and filled and unfilled hardened epoxy resins, by fluid bed pyrolysis. Experiments were carried out on a 1–3 kg/h laboratory scale system. The main products are 50–66% wt. pyrolysis gas and up to 29% wt. oil, with respect to organic input. The products consist mainly of hydrocarbons and N-hetero compounds, respectively. Increasing reaction temperatures lead to oils that are poorer in hetero compounds and richer in aromatics. Fillers are precepitated by a cyclone and can be regained.
