Release and transformation of chlorine during the pyrolysis of KCl- and MgCl2-loaded woods The release and transformation of chlorine (Cl) during the pyrolysis of biomass can be influenced by intrinsic minerals, such as potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg). However, the detailed mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. In this study, two wood samples, one with KCl addition and one with MgCl2 addition, were subjected to pyrolysis at 200 to 500 °C, focusing on the effect of cation on the redistribution of Cl. The Cl contents in pyrolysis char, heavy oil (condensed at 110 °C), and non-condensed gas (HCl and CH3Cl) were accurately analyzed. The results showed that Cl was released competitively as HCl and CH3Cl during pyrolysis at 200–500 °C, with the proportion of HCl initially increasing and then decreasing with an increase in temperature, reaching a maximum at 250 °C. The addition of Mg resulted in an increase in the Cl release ratio by 16.1–40.4 % and improved the proportion of water-insoluble Cl in the pyrolysis char and heavy oil. Conversely, the addition of K increased the percentage of compounds with methoxyl groups in primary volatiles and improved the possibility of HCl binding with methoxy groups, causing an increase in the proportion of CH3Cl. This study summarizes a detailed migration pathway of Cl during biomass pyrolysis.
