Dual-reactor system implementation for Li5FeO4-assisted sorption enhanced steam reforming for hydrogen production, during biomass pyrolysis Hydrogen production, from biomass pyrolysis, offers a viable solution to the growing demand for renewable energy, addressing CO2 emissions while reusing biomass waste. In this study, a designed dual-reactor system was implemented, via sorption enhanced steam reforming for biomass pyrolysis, optimizing H2 production while using Li5FeO4 as catalyst and carbon oxides sorbent. Glucose, cellulose and virgin cotton were used as biomass examples. Li5FeO4 additions, in both reactors and 10 % steam, improved H2 productions via sorption enhanced steam reforming process, up to 722.5 and 606.0 mL g−1 for cellulose and virgin cotton, respectively, while CO2 gas fractions decreased to 0.6 and 1.2 %. In the same system, isothermal experiments tests with glucose (850 °C for 90 min) yielded up to 1234 mL g−1 H2 production, with CO2 fractions as low as 1 %. Solid isothermal products characterization evidenced the Li5FeO4 conversion mechanism and the formation of Li2CO3 due to carbon oxides chemisorption. Furthermore, the role of Li5FeO4 in catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction was directly analyzed. Finally, thermodynamic calculations demonstrated the dual functionality of Li5FeO4 in the pyrolysis reactor.
