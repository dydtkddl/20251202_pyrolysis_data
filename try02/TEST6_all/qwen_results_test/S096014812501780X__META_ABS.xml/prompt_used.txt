You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dual-reactor system implementation for Li5FeO4-assisted sorption enhanced steam reforming for hydrogen production, during biomass pyrolysis Hydrogen production, from biomass pyrolysis, offers a viable solution to the growing demand for renewable energy, addressing CO2 emissions while reusing biomass waste. In this study, a designed dual-reactor system was implemented, via sorption enhanced steam reforming for biomass pyrolysis, optimizing H2 production while using Li5FeO4 as catalyst and carbon oxides sorbent. Glucose, cellulose and virgin cotton were used as biomass examples. Li5FeO4 additions, in both reactors and 10 % steam, improved H2 productions via sorption enhanced steam reforming process, up to 722.5 and 606.0 mL g−1 for cellulose and virgin cotton, respectively, while CO2 gas fractions decreased to 0.6 and 1.2 %. In the same system, isothermal experiments tests with glucose (850 °C for 90 min) yielded up to 1234 mL g−1 H2 production, with CO2 fractions as low as 1 %. Solid isothermal products characterization evidenced the Li5FeO4 conversion mechanism and the formation of Li2CO3 due to carbon oxides chemisorption. Furthermore, the role of Li5FeO4 in catalyzing the water-gas shift reaction was directly analyzed. Finally, thermodynamic calculations demonstrated the dual functionality of Li5FeO4 in the pyrolysis reactor.
