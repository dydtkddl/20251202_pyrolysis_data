Pollutant emissions from the pyrolysis and combustion of viscoelastic memory foam Thermal degradation of viscoelastic memory foam (VMF) in a horizontal laboratory scale reactor has been studied. Pyrolysis and combustion experiments under sub-stoichiometric conditions were performed at four different temperatures (550°C, 650°C, 750°C and 850°C) for the determination of pollutants. Analyses of gas and semivolatile compounds, including polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (dl-PCBs) are shown. From the results, it was deduced that pyrolytic conditions favor the formation of PAHs, methane, ethylene, NH3 and dl-PCBs, whereas the presence of oxygen involves a higher emission of PCDD/Fs and simple N-containing compounds such as NO and HCN. The toxic levels calculated for PAHs, PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in all cases were low confirming that the incineration of VMF mattress waste could be a good option for waste management. Nevertheless, relatively high emissions of NO, NH3 and HCN were obtained and their reduction must be considered.
