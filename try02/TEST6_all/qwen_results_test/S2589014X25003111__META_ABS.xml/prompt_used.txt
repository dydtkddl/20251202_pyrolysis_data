You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hybrid entropy-VIKOR optimization of Jatropha curcas biodiesel synthesis with advanced transesterification reaction input parametric analysis for yield, viscosity, and density Biodiesel, derived from triglyceride conversion, presents itself as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil diesel fuel to meet the increasing global energy demand. Lipid-rich, non-edible Jatropha curcas oil presents itself as a prime feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. A batch transesterification reactor was used in this research to experimentally facilitate the conversion of Jatropha curcas oil into biodiesel with homogenous KOH as a catalyst. The present study investigates a combined approach using a fractional factorial design for screening, followed by a novel hybrid Entropy-VIKOR approach for ranking experimental alternatives to achieve maximum yield and minimum viscosity of produced biodiesel. A separate statistical approach is also employed to analyze the combined effects of transesterification reaction input parameters (catalyst loading and reaction temperature; chemical interaction time, and methanol-to-lipid molar ratio) on the resulting yield, viscosity, and density, using 3D surface plots and empirical relations. The combined experimental and numerical based investigation indicated that the optimum biodiesel produced from Jatropha curcas oil with yield: 93.16 %, viscosity: 4.0 cSt, and density: 871–881 kg/m3 and these results are obtained under the following conditions: Homogenous base catalyst loading of 1.5 % (w/w), reaction temperature of 65 °C, chemical interaction time of 120 min, and a methanol-to-lipid molar ratio of 6:1. The resulting composition of Jatropha curcas oil-based biodiesel have physicochemical characteristics within specified limits as per international EN 14214 standards.
