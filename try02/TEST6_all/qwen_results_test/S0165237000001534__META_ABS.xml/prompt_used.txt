You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of low density polyethylene into petrochemical feedstocks using a continuous screw kiln reactor Thermal and catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using a screw kiln reactor provided with two zones of reaction temperature. Thermal degradation experiments carried out at different temperatures and screw speeds have shown that this continuous system is suitable for the LDPE degradation, product outputs up to c.a. 100 g/h being obtained. Compared to a conventional batch reactor, the screw kiln system leads to a lower formation of gaseous products, whereas overcracking of the heavy fractions is also reduced. These differences are probably originated by the intimate contact and the same residence times for all the product fractions that exist within the screw reactor, which is in contrast with the selective and fast withdrawal of volatile products taking place in the batch system. In the catalytic experiments, a mesoporous MCM-41 type aluminosilicate has been used as catalyst, being continuously fed to the screw reactor mixed with the raw plastic material. In these conditions, yields up to 80% towards hydrocarbons within the gasoline range (C5C12) have been obtained. Moreover, high amounts of C7 and C8 hydrocarbons are present in the gasoline fractions, which is assigned to catalytic oligomerization reactions that selectively affect to C3 and C4 gaseous hydrocarbons.
