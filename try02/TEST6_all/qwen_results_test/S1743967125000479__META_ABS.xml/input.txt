Recent progress on the synergistic preparation of liquid fuels by co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and plastic wastes Pyrolysis is an efficient method for waste utilization. Biomass pyrolysis can generate renewable fuel and value-added liquid fuel; however, the liquid fuel typically exhibits high oxygen content, low calorific value, and corrosiveness. Co-pyrolysis with plastics presents a significant approach to addressing these challenges. This paper summarizes the physical and chemical properties of biomass and plastics, analyzes their elemental and industrial characteristics, and calculates the effective hydrogen value of the raw materials, which aids in the selection of suitable feedstocks for the pyrolysis process. The free radical mechanism and synergistic effects of the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics are also discussed. Additionally, the influences of raw material type, process parameters, and catalyst type on the co-pyrolysis process are examined. Finally, the common characterization techniques for analyzing biomass and plastic co-pyrolysis liquid products in recent years are summarized, providing a reference for future research aimed at obtaining efficient renewable energy products through characterization technology analysis and appropriate regulation of raw materials and process parameters.
