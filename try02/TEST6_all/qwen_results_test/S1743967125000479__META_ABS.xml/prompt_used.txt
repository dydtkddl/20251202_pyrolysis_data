You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress on the synergistic preparation of liquid fuels by co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and plastic wastes Pyrolysis is an efficient method for waste utilization. Biomass pyrolysis can generate renewable fuel and value-added liquid fuel; however, the liquid fuel typically exhibits high oxygen content, low calorific value, and corrosiveness. Co-pyrolysis with plastics presents a significant approach to addressing these challenges. This paper summarizes the physical and chemical properties of biomass and plastics, analyzes their elemental and industrial characteristics, and calculates the effective hydrogen value of the raw materials, which aids in the selection of suitable feedstocks for the pyrolysis process. The free radical mechanism and synergistic effects of the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics are also discussed. Additionally, the influences of raw material type, process parameters, and catalyst type on the co-pyrolysis process are examined. Finally, the common characterization techniques for analyzing biomass and plastic co-pyrolysis liquid products in recent years are summarized, providing a reference for future research aimed at obtaining efficient renewable energy products through characterization technology analysis and appropriate regulation of raw materials and process parameters.
