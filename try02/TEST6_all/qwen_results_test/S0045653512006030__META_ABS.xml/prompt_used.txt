You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photolytic degradation of decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) The photolytic degradation of decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), an alternative flame retardant to decabromodiphenyl ether, was investigated in a variety of matrixes (n-hexane, tetrahydrofuran, methanol/water, humic acid/water, and silica gel) by irradiation under ultraviolet light and in n-hexane under natural light. Photolytic degradation of DBDPE occurs in all the matrixes investigated within the irradiation period ( n-hexane (t 1/2 =16.6min)>humic acid/water (30silica gel (t 1/2 =75.9min)>methanol/water (t 1/2 >240min). The reaction in tetrahydrofuran, n-hexane, and silica gel matrixes can be described by the pseudo first order kinetics. Nevertheless, the matrixes have little effect on the degradation product distributions of DBDPE. A numbers of debrominated intermediates were identified. The degradation involves the initial formation of nona-BDPEs and the subsequent decomposition of these congeners to lower brominated congeners (octa- and hepta-BDPEs) within the irradiation time. To our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt to investigate the photolytic degradation kinetics and the identification of intermediates, as well as the degradation mechanism, during the degradation of DBDPE. Further research is needed to understand the photolytic degradation pattern of DBDPE in the natural environment.
