You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dechlorination during pyrolysis of plastics: Effect of municipal plastic waste composition In order to close the loop in chemical recycling via pyrolysis, products must meet strict limits for halogen content to be used in conventional petrochemical processes. By integrating dechlorination as an integral part of pyrolysis, results show that the efficiency of dechlorination, both via stepwise pyrolysis and dechlorination agents, is significantly decreased in the presence of PET or cellulose in the feedstock. Product analysis showed that Cl reacts with formed oxygenated substances, some of which remain in the reactor during the 1st step at 350 °C and subsequently pass into the final liquid product. This increases the requirements for applied dechlorinating agents during the 2nd pyrolysis step. Novel agents have to therefore cope with a wide range of chlorinated hydrocarbons. By combining acidic β-zeolite with alkali hydrotalcite in a 1:1 ratio, a synergic effect towards dechlorination was observed, increasing individual efficiency by about 12% and 6%, respectively. Combining stepwise pyrolysis, which removed 38% of Cl on average, with the mentioned mixture of agents, 95% efficiency and 12.2 ± 1.2 ppm of Cl were obtained in the final liquid product. Such a level of dechlorination may be sufficient, considering that the pyrolysis liquid will be diluted in conventional petrochemical feedstocks.
