You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

N-doped carbon carriers loaded with NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu): Catalytic synergistic pyrolysis of herbal residues and polypropylene to generate three-phase products and carbon nanotubes Catalytic pyrolysis can transform organic solid waste into high-quality pyrolysis products, in which N-doped biochar is an efficient and economical catalyst. Herein, N-doped activated carbon (NAC) and modified biochar (NZC) loaded with bimetal NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu) were used to catalyze the pyrolysis of Chinese medicinal drug residue and polypropylene in a two-stage reaction system to prepare three-phase products and carbon nanotubes. This indicates that the metal/NAC group catalysts possess a larger SBET, whereas the metal/NZC group has better thermal stability. Under NiCo/NZC catalysis, the abundant yield of short-chain carbon C6-C11(49 %) and aromatic hydrocarbons (39.5 %) suggests strong arylation and secondary cracking capabilities. N-doping improved the surface functional group richness of the catalyst, while the bimetal provided more active electrons, which promoted the generation of carbon nanotubes in the late stage of the pyrolysis process. N-doped carbon-based catalysts loaded with metals exhibit an improved catalytic effect, which is conducive to the promotion and application of N-doped catalysts.
