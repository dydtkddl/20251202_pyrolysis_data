You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste with magnetic catalysts in a multi-ridge field compressed reactor Environmental crises caused by plastic pollution have spurred the development of novel recovery and upcycling methods. In this study, a microwave magnetic field and magnetic catalyst cracking strategy based on a microwave multi-ridge field compressed reactor was proposed to efficiently convert polyethylene into hydrogen and high-quality carbon nanotubes while minimising energy consumption. A series of catalysts with different iron and cobalt contents was prepared and evaluated for hydrogen production from polyethylene cracking. A high hydrogen yield of 61.6 mmol·g−1 plastic was obtained in the magnetic field position with an energy consumption of only 5 W·h g−1 plastic, whereas the hydrogen yield was 45.7 mmol·g−1 plastic under microwave electric field. Under microwave magnetic field activation, the magnetic catalyst CoFeO x exhibited higher selectivity for H2 than hydrocarbons in waste plastics. In addition, high hydrogen yields were achieved by varying the ratio of the catalyst feedstock in the electric field and intermediate positions of the reactor. This reactor separates the microwave fields in the reactor and places catalysts with different absorption characteristics at different positions, which can significantly improve the efficiency of microwave energy utilisation.
