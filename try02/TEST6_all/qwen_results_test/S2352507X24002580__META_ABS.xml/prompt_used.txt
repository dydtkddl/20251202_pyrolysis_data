You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

2D-nanostructures as flame retardant additives: Recent progress in hybrid polymeric coatings The use of polymers in day-to-day life is undeniable; nevertheless, applicability of these polymers in the fire risk sector poses serious limitations as most of the polymeric materials/coatings employed are prone to fire. Hence to improve the fire retardant (FR) properties of polymers, researchers recommend the use of FR materials/additives, either physically blended or incorporated chemically via suitable modifications. However, to achieve sufficient FR property, usually higher amounts of traditional FRs are required which understandably deteriorates the mechanical and other important properties of the polymers. Moreover, use of halogenated FRs are under immense scrutiny due to the possible release of carcinogenic and organic pollutants. As a result development of halogen-free FRs is an emerging field of research. In this context, incorporation of nanostructured two-dimensional (2-D) materials to form polymer composites that can not only reinforce the mechanical, thermal and other important properties but also improve flame retardancy has opened up new prospects. The 2-D nanostructured materials, particularly, layered double hydroxide (LDH), MXenes, Graphene and its derivatives, Boron Nitride (BN) and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) have demonstrated capabilities to enhance the FR properties as a green and environmentally benign material. Incorporation of these 2-D materials into polymers to form nanohybrids can be achieved either as conventional filler or as surface modified systems chemically bonded to the parent matrix. In the present review, the recent development strategies of surface modifications employed on 2-D nanostructured materials (LDH, MXenes, GO, BN and/or MoS2) to form polymeric nanocomposites and the FR properties achieved are discussed. The significant outcomes reported by various research groups, the key insights gained and viewpoints are deliberated. A plausible underlying mechanism for flame retardancy offered by 2-D nanostructured materials (LDH, MXenes, GO, BN and/or MoS2) based polymer nanocomposites as extended by several research groups is discussed.
