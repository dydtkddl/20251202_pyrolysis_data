You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Single step microwaves assisted catalytic conversion of plastic waste into valuable fuel and carbon nanotubes The deconstruction of plastic waste into hydrogen, carbonaceous materials and hydrocarbons is an attractive way of meeting the global energy demand. This paper presents single-step microwave pyrolysis of high-density plastic waste using different catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For catalytic pyrolysis, NiFe2O4, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 catalysts were prepared through a facile sol-gel method. The highest hydrogen yield was recorded with NiFe2O4 catalyst, which is about 57 mmol.g−1. The hydrogen production efficiency was about 93 wt.%. In comparison to polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the polystyrenes (PS) produced the highest yield of solid carbon (73 wt.%) with NiFe2O4 catalyst. The produced CNTs were characterized through XRD, TEM, SEM, TGA and RAMAN spectroscopy. The NiFe2O4 catalyst produced relatively pure and well-structured CNTs as compared to Al2O3 and Fe2O3 catalysts.
