Development of 8 ton/day gasification process to generate electricity using a gas engine for solid refuse fuel An 8 ton/day solid refuse fuel gasification process with air oxidant was operated under various conditions to generate electricity. Solid refuse fuels with fluff type feedstock were fabricated from municipal solid wastes. The tested experimental conditions included feedstock charging rate into the gasifier, equivalence ratio, and oxygen enrichment; varying these conditions resulted in different gasification characteristics, such as cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion ratio. Optimum conditions were a charging rate of 50 to 60% by volume (504.71 to 605.65 kg/Sm2) of feedstock in the gasifier, equivalence ratio of 0.21 to 0.33, and no oxygen enrichment. Average cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion ratio were 71.30% and 72.07%, respectively, at optimum conditions. Pollutants such as dust, tar, and gases, were analyzed at the outlet of the cleaning facility and gasifier, and their low concentrations in the producer gas were sufficient to allow for operation of the gas engine. The gasification process exhibited stable operation over 288 h, which included the facility check period. The average gasifier temperature was 825 °C, 17.14% by volume of producer gas was syngas, and gas engine power generation was 235 kWh during this period; power consumption of the entire system was 68 kWh. These results demonstrate that the gasification process for converting solid waste to energy can be operated at a commercial scale.
