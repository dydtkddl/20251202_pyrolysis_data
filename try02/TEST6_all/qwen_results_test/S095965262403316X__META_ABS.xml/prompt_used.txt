You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic modelling and mechanism elucidation of catalyst-free dimethyl terephthalate hydrolysis process intensification by reactive distillation Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used thermoplastic polymer in the packaging and materials industries, and is predicted to have continuous market growth in the future. Methods such as glycolysis and methanolysis of PET have been identified as promising approaches in sustainable chemical recycling of PET. The latter produces dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which can be easily hydrolyzed to terephthalic acid (TPA) at elevated temperatures and pressures, and further reused for PET production. The aim of this study was to develop a kinetic model for the hydrolysis of dimethyl terephthalate, using the experimental data. Various reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, time) have been investigated and used to calculate the activation energies and reaction rate constants, while the variation in reactor setup with methanol (MeOH) removal was conducted to show its detrimental effect on the efficiency of the reaction and selectivity towards terephthalic acid. The first reaction step of DMT to monomethyl terephthalate (MMT) is relatively irreversible, while the second reaction step of MMT to TPA ceases, as soon as the equilibrium is reached. Highest yields of TPA (76.7 %) were obtained after 40 min at 265 °C, with MeOH removal, and the activation energy was calculated to be 95 and 64 kJ mol−1 for the first and second hydrolysis reaction step, respectively.
