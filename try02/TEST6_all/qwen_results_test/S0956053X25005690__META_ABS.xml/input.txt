Plasma gasification as a potential solution for waste minimization and clean energy production: A critical review on techno-economic-environmental assessment and modelling approaches The review paper emphasizes the utilization of plasma in gasification technology for energy recovery through the thermal decomposition of a wide range of wastes. In recent years, waste as a fuel in plasma gasification has attracted more interest due to its ability to generate a significant amount of clean energy without any pollution. Hence, a comprehensive study of the available literature on thermal plasma gasification is set forth, including the factors influencing syngas composition, yield and heating value. Techno-economic-environmental and life cycle analyses of plasma gasifier and integrated other conventional/advanced technologies are carried out to identify the effectiveness, feasibility of the systems with respect to the feed type, energy efficiency, cost and ecology. These can act as a benchmark for readers intending to work on plasma gasification. The economic and environmental performance in relation to end-use application is provided to emphasize plasma gasification as a practical and low pollutant technology. Besides, the modelling approaches undertaken on plasma gasification are also shown with more focus on the thermodynamic equilibrium and data-driven model. Finally, some of real-scale pilot/industrial application of plasma gasification is provided. The initial investment cost is still one area of concern, but the adoption of administrative and social policies is expected to increase its market in the future.
