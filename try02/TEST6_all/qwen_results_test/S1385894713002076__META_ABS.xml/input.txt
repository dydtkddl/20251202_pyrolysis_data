Fluid bed adsorption of carbon dioxide on immobilized polyethylenimine (PEI): Kinetic analysis and breakthrough behavior The adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) by immobilized polyethylenimine (PEI) on mesoporous silica was investigated in a fluid bed. The tests were performed to determine breakthrough behavior with varying bed temperature, flow rates and feed concentrations. Experimental breakthrough curves were analyzed using a theoretical 1D model developed by Bohart and Adams. The results showed that Bohart–Adams model was suitable for the normal description of breakthrough curve for the temperature ranges of 40–90°C. The maximum capacity increased with temperature up to 70°C and then decreased. The adsorption rate constant exhibited a negative temperature dependence decreasing as the temperature increased. Parameters characteristic of a fluid bed adsorber were inferred from these breakthrough curves including the breakthrough time, saturation time, critical reactor length, and length of mass transfer zone LMTZ. These parameters can be used to design fluid bed adsorption system without resolving the mechanistic contributions of dispersion, mixing, and intraparticle diffusion.
