You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From pandemic protection to fuel production: Conversion of waste personal protective equipment-kits to high-quality hydro-processed fuels The advent of COVID-19 has heightened apprehensions within the plastic waste management sector, particularly due to the increased adoption of single-use personal protective equipment (PPE)-kits at the domestic level and hospitals for protection against contagious diseases. This study addresses the issue by focusing on the hydro-processing of pyrolytic oil derived from thermally catalysed cracking of sterilized waste PPE kits. Employing an indigenously prepared FCC-supported Ni catalyst, the investigation delves into the effects of hydrogenation process parameters-temperature, catalyst composition, and catalyst loadings—maintaining a constant pressure of 70 bar H2 on fuel quality. Experimental results indicate that oil upgraded at a higher temperature of 240 °C with a 10% Ni/FCC catalyst at a 20 wt% loading demonstrates a remarkable selectivity of 76.51 wt% compounds in the C5-12 range, signifying a substantial gasoline fraction. The hydrogenated oil exhibits 57.05 wt% paraffinic content and a desirable 24.5 wt% yield of aromatics. GC-MS analysis reveals the presence of 25 wt% C5-7 iso-alkanes, 9.33 wt% toluene, and 12.35 wt% benzene, closely resembling the composition of commercial gasoline. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of the hydrogenated oil meet specifications for commercial gasoline suitable for automobile applications, making it a viable substitute or complement for blending with commercial gasoline.
