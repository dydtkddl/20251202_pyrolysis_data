You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mitigation of bromine-containing products during pyrolysis of polycarbonate-based tetrabromobisphenol A in the presence of copper(I) oxide Polycarbonate (PC) is an engineering thermoplastic that is widely used in electrical and electronic equipment. This plastic often contains tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), the most common brominated flame retardant. Thermal degradation of the PC-TBBA leads to generation of numerous bromo-organic products in the pyrolytic oil, hindering its appropriate utilization, as well as corrosive hydrogen bromide gas. The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate and compare the pyrolysis products of PC-TBBA and PC-TBBA + Cu2O at various temperatures, with an emphasis on the yield and distribution of brominated compounds. In pyrolysis of PC-TBBA + Cu2O, at the maximum degradation temperature (600 °C), as much as 86% of total Br was trapped in the residue, while 3% and 11% were distributed in the condensate and gas fractions, respectively. In contrast, the distribution of Br from non-catalytic pyrolysis of PC-TBBA (600 °C) was 0.5% residue, 40% condensate, and 60% gas. The results of this study revealed that in the presence of Cu2O, organo-bromine products were most likely involved in Ullman-type coupling reactions, leading to early cross-linking of the polymer network that efficiently hinders their vaporization. HBr in the gas fraction was suppressed due to effective fixation of bromine in residue in the form of CuBr.
