You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of different types and sections of end-of-life tyres: Kinetics and experiments to improve product quality Pyrolysis contributes to the transition of the tyre industry towards a circular economy model. Tyre rubber is a complex blend of polymers, inorganic additives and grades of carbon black, depending on the tyre type and section. The products of the end-of-life tyres (ELTs) pyrolysis are heavily influenced by the original composition, so separation prior to pyrolysis could be an important step in optimising the recycling process. However, recyclers often ignore the composition of ELTs. This study aims to develop a simple methodology for evaluating the potential resource recovery of ETLs samples from a set of thermogravimetric experiments applying a Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM). Pyrolysis experiments were also carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to analyse the composition of the products. Direct linear relations were identified between specific values of the initial mass fraction parameter of the DAEM and the natural and synthetic rubber content, and notably with the limonene content in the pyrolysis oils. A high 12 wt% limonene in the oil product was obtained from the sample with the 83 wt% natural rubber content at 450 ºC. In addition, significant differences in the ash content were observed in the raw recovered carbon black from the tread sections (31 wt%-55 wt%) to the non-tread sections of the ELTs (7 wt%-16 wt%), which had a positive effect on its quality. This work demonstrates that the application of a straightforward methodology on separated types and sections of ELTs can greatly enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of their recycling processes.
