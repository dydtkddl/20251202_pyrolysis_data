You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic application of polyvinyl chloride in thermochemical conversion of biomass Biorefineries are sustainable alternatives to petrochemical-based industrial systems. However, their practical implementation has been constrained by the environmental and economic challenges associated with their reliance on harsh homogeneous catalysts. This study explored the utilization of wasted polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a potential catalyst in a corncob biorefinery. Thermogravimetric analysis of the PVC and corncob mixture samples revealed thermal degradation profiles distinct from the predicted outcomes, indicating modified reaction pathways. Co-pyrolysis also enhanced H2 generation by 120 % compared to corncob pyrolysis owing to the reaction between PVC-derived HCl and corncob derivatives. Gas monitoring experiments demonstrated that HCl generated from PVC played a critical role in catalyzing biomass conversion into valuable chemicals such as furfural, levoglucosenone, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural at temperatures <360 °C. Especially, co-pyrolysis of PVC and corncob at a 1:1 blending ratio increased furfural yield by approximately 1700 % compared to corncob pyrolysis. Furthermore, CO2-assisted pyrolysis reduced polyaromatic hydrocarbon formation while enhancing the generation of monoaromatic hydrocarbon and syngas. These findings demonstrate the potential of PVC and CO2 in corncob pyrolysis to enhance overall biorefinery efficiency and mitigate pollutant generation, offering a promising pathway for sustainable biorefinery development.
