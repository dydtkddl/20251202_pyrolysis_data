You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improvement of solubility and functional properties of wheat bran fibers by ozone treatment Wheat Bran (WB) components have multiple beneficial properties for human health. Physical, Chemical and biological treatments are used to improve WB physicochemical properties or extract WB bioactive components, but they can have drawbacks (cost, conditions, scalability). In this study an attempt was made to investigate the effect of ozone treatment on the physicochemical and functional properties of WB to further improve its nutritional and health benefits. Ozone treatment was carried out on a semi-industrial pilot scale with different O3 consumption levels ranging from 3 to 24 g/kg of WB. WB structural characterization was carried out using spectroscopy (FT-IR) and microscopy (SEM) analyses. WB fiber molecular effect was studied using fractionation analysis. Composition and functional properties (antioxidant power, binding capacities, inhibitory activities) were also assessed. As expected, ozone treatment did not impact WB structure. However, ozonation significantly increased the soluble dietary fiber content in WB by 32–67 % indicating transformation of insoluble hemicelluloses. This was likely due to the ability of ozone to oxidize phenolic acids and to cleave β-glucans glycosidic bond. This reduces WB fiber molecular weight. Ozone shows major positive effects on WB functional properties by improving cholesterol adsorption capacity or α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. As conclusion, ozone could be a good candidate for the optimization of WB physicochemical and functional properties without altering its macromolecular structure. Furthermore, it is a green process that offers greater scalability for industrial applications compared to other treatments, enabling its incorporation in a wide range of food products.
