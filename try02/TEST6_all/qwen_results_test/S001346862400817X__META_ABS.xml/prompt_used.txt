You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Auto-reduction of Au(III) on Fe-Doped, Pyrrolic-N-Modified nanoporous carbon derived from ZIF-8 for the electrochemical immunosensing of CA-125 Ovarian cancer (OC) is associated with high late mortality owing to hidden symptoms in the early stages and limited screening measurements. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a highly efficient label-free immunosensor for targeting cancer antigens. In this study, we developed a gold-loaded iron-doped nanoporous carbon (denoted as Au@Fe-NC) as an ideal substrate for cancer antigen detection with high specificity and sensitivity. First, an Fe, N-doped nanoporous carbon (Fe-NC) material was synthesized by carbonizing a Fe-doped metal-organic framework at 900 °C under continuous nitrogen flow. The resultant Fe-NC contains pyrrolic-N, which facilitates the auto-reduction of Au3+ to Au⁰ without requiring an external reducing agent. Thus, the Au@Fe-NC was spontaneously formed by mixing an aqueous HAuCl₄ solution with Fe-NC. The immunosensor developed using Au@Fe-NC exhibits outstanding stability as well as high sensitivity to carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125), a tumor marker, presenting a linear dynamic range of 0.1 pg mL−1 to 1 µg mL−1 and a detection limit of 0.1 pg mL−1. The proposed Au@Fe-NC-based immunosensor has the ability to detect CA-125 in human serum samples and is a promising material for OC diagnosis.
