You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Growth of carbon nanofibers/tubes by an in-situ polymerization route without metal-catalyst An in-situ pyrolytic and polymerizable method was investigated to grow carbon nano-fibers/tubes (CNF/CNT) without metal-catalysts. The 3 mol % yttria-stabilized zirconia hollow fiber membranes (3YSZ-HFM) were used as supports for growing the CNF/CNT. The polyethersulfone (PES) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were used as polymer binders and carbon sources. The as-grown CNF (formed at 1250 °C/4h) had diameters of 50–100 nm and lengths of 1–50 μm, and the length gradually decreased along radial direction of the supports. The as-grown CNT (formed at 1450 °C/4h) were shorter and larger in diameter. A novel solid-state transformation mechanism was proposed, in which the carbon black particles (CB) were the carbonized products of PES/PVP, then the CB grew into the CNF/CNT. Thermal stresses originated from sintering of CB itself and 3YSZ particles were believed to be the driving forces that promoting the CNT/CNF nucleation and growth. The thermal stresses of the pure 3YSZ-HFM and 3YSZ/(CNF/CNT)-HFM were theoretically and experimentally discussed base on linear elastic thoery and Raman spectroscopy.
