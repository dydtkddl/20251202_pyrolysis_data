Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene with lead sulfide into fuel oil The influence of lead sulfide as a catalyst on the pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene has been investigated. The yield and composition of the derived gas, oil and wax have been studied in terms of the temperature, time and amount of catalyst. The oil consisted of mainly paraffins and olefins. More than 70% yield of gas and liquid fraction with boiling point up to 350°C was obtained. The composition of the oil fraction was characterized by physicochemical properties of petroleum fuel. Distillation data showed that ∼10% have the boiling range of light naphtha (<160°C), ∼30% of heavy naphtha (160–208°C) and ∼55% of middle distillate (208–350°C). Lead sulfide was found to be an effective catalyst for conversion of polyethylene into fuel oil.
