Effect of metal modification of titania and hydrogen co-feeding on the reaction pathways and catalytic stability in the acetone aldol condensation A stable performance of TiO2 catalysts for gas-phase acetone aldol condensation was observed when reduced metals were added (Pt or Ni, 1.5 wt%) and the reactions were conducted in presence of hydrogen. In both cases, the resulting metal-loaded catalysts are stable for 10 h, whereas continuous deactivation is observed for the parent TiO2 catalyst (573 K). Both the activation of the H2 molecule by metal nanoparticles and the change of the catalytic surface by metal insertion (in the case of Ni-loaded catalyst) enable suppressing oligomerization (by hindering enolates formation) and the strong adsorption of intermediates (by decreasing the concentration of high-strength acid-basic active sites), respectively. More interestingly, these metals allow to tune the selectivity of the reaction. Indeed, the Ni-loaded titania catalyst is highly selective for the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated ketones (selectivity to unsaturated C6 and C9 species >98%, at ∼12% acetone conversion), whereas the Pt-loaded one is highly selective to the formation of saturated C6 and C9 ketones (MIBK and DIBK, with selectivities >95% at ∼42% acetone conversion). The catalytic activity and stability of the two materials (Ni/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2) in both absence and presence of H2 are compared between them and with those of the parent TiO2. The results obtained by the reaction gas-phase analysis are supplemented through different solid characterization techniques (i.e., CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD, HRTEM, XPS, TPO, and DRIFTS).
