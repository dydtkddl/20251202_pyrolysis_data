You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of metal modification of titania and hydrogen co-feeding on the reaction pathways and catalytic stability in the acetone aldol condensation A stable performance of TiO2 catalysts for gas-phase acetone aldol condensation was observed when reduced metals were added (Pt or Ni, 1.5 wt%) and the reactions were conducted in presence of hydrogen. In both cases, the resulting metal-loaded catalysts are stable for 10 h, whereas continuous deactivation is observed for the parent TiO2 catalyst (573 K). Both the activation of the H2 molecule by metal nanoparticles and the change of the catalytic surface by metal insertion (in the case of Ni-loaded catalyst) enable suppressing oligomerization (by hindering enolates formation) and the strong adsorption of intermediates (by decreasing the concentration of high-strength acid-basic active sites), respectively. More interestingly, these metals allow to tune the selectivity of the reaction. Indeed, the Ni-loaded titania catalyst is highly selective for the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated ketones (selectivity to unsaturated C6 and C9 species >98%, at ∼12% acetone conversion), whereas the Pt-loaded one is highly selective to the formation of saturated C6 and C9 ketones (MIBK and DIBK, with selectivities >95% at ∼42% acetone conversion). The catalytic activity and stability of the two materials (Ni/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2) in both absence and presence of H2 are compared between them and with those of the parent TiO2. The results obtained by the reaction gas-phase analysis are supplemented through different solid characterization techniques (i.e., CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD, HRTEM, XPS, TPO, and DRIFTS).
