You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The production of debrominated aromatics via the catalytic pyrolysis of flexible printed circuit boards Pyrolysis is an environmental technology for the proper treatment of electronic waste (e-waste) for the production of fuel. However, the presence of brominated compounds in pyrolysis oil makes its commercialization difficult. In this study, various types of zeolites, HY (30), HZSM-5 (30), HZSM-5 (50), HZSM-5 (280), and basic metal oxides (MgO and CaO) were used for the pyrolysis of flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs) for the first time to produce bromine-free oil. A higher production efficiency of debrominated aromatic hydrocarbons, primarily benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEXs), and naphthalene with zeolites, was achieved over basic metal oxides. The use of HZSM-5 (HZ) (30) increased the amount of benzene (an area of 31.5 × 107) and toluene (an area of 17.6 × 107), and a high debromination efficiency was observed for basic metal oxides owing to the strong affinity of halides toward the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. Among the BTEXs, benzene (an area of 31.5 × 107) and toluene (an area of 17.6 × 107) were obtained as highly selective monoaromatics in the presence of the catalyst HZ (30). CaO and HZ (30) were effective for debromination and aromatic production, respectively. The in-situ CaO/ex-situ HZ (30) combination revealed ∼ 100% debromination efficiency; however, the total aromatic hydrocarbon production was higher on the in-situ HZ (30)/ex-situ CaO with ∼ 77.5% debromination efficiency. Meanwhile, the in-situ HZ (30)/ex-situ CaO configuration could achieve ∼ 100% debromination efficiency by increasing the amount of CaO to 7 times to feed.
