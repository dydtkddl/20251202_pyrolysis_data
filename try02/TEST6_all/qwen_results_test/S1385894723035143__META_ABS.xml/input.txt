The production of debrominated aromatics via the catalytic pyrolysis of flexible printed circuit boards Pyrolysis is an environmental technology for the proper treatment of electronic waste (e-waste) for the production of fuel. However, the presence of brominated compounds in pyrolysis oil makes its commercialization difficult. In this study, various types of zeolites, HY (30), HZSM-5 (30), HZSM-5 (50), HZSM-5 (280), and basic metal oxides (MgO and CaO) were used for the pyrolysis of flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs) for the first time to produce bromine-free oil. A higher production efficiency of debrominated aromatic hydrocarbons, primarily benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BTEXs), and naphthalene with zeolites, was achieved over basic metal oxides. The use of HZSM-5 (HZ) (30) increased the amount of benzene (an area of 31.5 × 107) and toluene (an area of 17.6 × 107), and a high debromination efficiency was observed for basic metal oxides owing to the strong affinity of halides toward the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. Among the BTEXs, benzene (an area of 31.5 × 107) and toluene (an area of 17.6 × 107) were obtained as highly selective monoaromatics in the presence of the catalyst HZ (30). CaO and HZ (30) were effective for debromination and aromatic production, respectively. The in-situ CaO/ex-situ HZ (30) combination revealed ∼ 100% debromination efficiency; however, the total aromatic hydrocarbon production was higher on the in-situ HZ (30)/ex-situ CaO with ∼ 77.5% debromination efficiency. Meanwhile, the in-situ HZ (30)/ex-situ CaO configuration could achieve ∼ 100% debromination efficiency by increasing the amount of CaO to 7 times to feed.
