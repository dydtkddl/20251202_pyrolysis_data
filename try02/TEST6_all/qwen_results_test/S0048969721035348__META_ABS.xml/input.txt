A review on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based hybrid membranes for water and wastewater treatment Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has gained enormous attention for water and wastewater treatment. Compared with g-C3N4 nanopowders, g-C3N4 based hybrid membranes have demonstrated great potential for its superior practicability. This review outlines the preparation and characterization of g-C3N4 based hybrid membranes and presents their representative applications in water and wastewater treatment (e.g., removal of organic dyes, phenolic compounds, pharmaceuticals, salt ions, heavy metals, and oils). Meanwhile, g-C3N4 based films for the removal of contaminants through photocatalytic degradation is also summarized. In addition, the corresponding mechanisms and relevant findings are discussed. Finally, the challenges and research needs in the future and application of g-C3N4 based hybrid membranes are highlighted.
