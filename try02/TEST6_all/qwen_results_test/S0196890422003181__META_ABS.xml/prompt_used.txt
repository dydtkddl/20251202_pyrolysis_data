You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring kinetic mechanisms of biomass pyrolysis using generalized logistic mixture model Pyrolysis is one of promising possible paths for converting waste biomass to heat, bio-fuels, or higher value chemicals. The pyrolysis of biomass involves several overlapping processes due to its complex composition and the complexity of pyrolysis reactions. The characterization and applicability of the generalized logistic mixture model in the kinetic analysis of simulated processes and lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis processes were investigated. The generalized logistic model showed asymmetrical kinetic profiles, which could fit the simulated DAEM and parallel processes more accurately than the logistic and Weibull models. The pyrolysis kinetic data of xylan, cellulose and lignin could be accurately described by the generalized logistic model with a single component. The pyrolysis kinetics of raw and acid-infused corn stovers was well fitted by the generalized logistic mixture model with three components, and the characterization of individual sub-processes separated from the model could reflect the acid infusion mechanism of corn stover. The generalized logistic mixture model effectively separated the pyrolysis process of raw and acid-washed cotton stalk into three sub-processes, and the kinetic analysis of individual sub-processes using the Friedman isoconversional method showed that those separated sub-processes corresponded to the thermal decomposition of pseudo-components of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Acid washing could reduce the fraction of pseudo-hemicellulose, and increase the pseudo-lignin fraction according to the results from the generalized logistic mixture model. The generalized logistic mixture model enables us to obtain the further kinetic information of the individual processes for lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis.
