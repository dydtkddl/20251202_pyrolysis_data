You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dual-laser powder bed fusion of difficult-to-process tungsten heavy-alloy: Inhibition of inferior defects and integrated fabrication of thin-walled overhanging structures Tungsten heavy alloys (WHAs) with thin-walled structures fabricated by the single-laser powder bed fusion (SL-PBF), are sensitive to the microcracks and have a poor mechanical performance. Dual-laser powder bed fusion (DL-PBF) was introduced to integrated fabrication of crack-free 98W-Ni-Fe alloy. Effects of the dual-laser interval time on the thermodynamics, the relative density, crystal patterns and compressive performance were studied. It was revealed that the residual pores and the microcracks of the DL-PBF processed 98W-Ni-Fe could be efficiently restricted with the maximum relative density of 99.1 %. Compared with the columnar crystals of the SL-PBF processed 98W-Ni-Fe, the equiaxed crystals within the DL-PBF processed parts were obtained, restricting the microcracks propagation along the columnar crystal boundary. Due to the dual-laser interaction, the cooling rate lower than that of SL-PBF process could be reasonably obtained and the terminally solidified temperature was higher than the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of W matrix. The maximum compressive strength was as high as 2510 MPa with the obvious cleavage steps and facets in the fracture morphology. The near defect-free 98W-Ni-Fe thin-walled overhanging structure, with a height and thickness of 40mm and 3mm, was successfully fabricated by the DL-PBF process, confirmed by the OM characterization of the cross-sections along the building direction. DL-PBF process has the potential to realizing the efficient integrated fabrication of WHAs with complicated structures.
