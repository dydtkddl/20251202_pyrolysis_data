Dual-laser powder bed fusion of difficult-to-process tungsten heavy-alloy: Inhibition of inferior defects and integrated fabrication of thin-walled overhanging structures Tungsten heavy alloys (WHAs) with thin-walled structures fabricated by the single-laser powder bed fusion (SL-PBF), are sensitive to the microcracks and have a poor mechanical performance. Dual-laser powder bed fusion (DL-PBF) was introduced to integrated fabrication of crack-free 98W-Ni-Fe alloy. Effects of the dual-laser interval time on the thermodynamics, the relative density, crystal patterns and compressive performance were studied. It was revealed that the residual pores and the microcracks of the DL-PBF processed 98W-Ni-Fe could be efficiently restricted with the maximum relative density of 99.1 %. Compared with the columnar crystals of the SL-PBF processed 98W-Ni-Fe, the equiaxed crystals within the DL-PBF processed parts were obtained, restricting the microcracks propagation along the columnar crystal boundary. Due to the dual-laser interaction, the cooling rate lower than that of SL-PBF process could be reasonably obtained and the terminally solidified temperature was higher than the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of W matrix. The maximum compressive strength was as high as 2510 MPa with the obvious cleavage steps and facets in the fracture morphology. The near defect-free 98W-Ni-Fe thin-walled overhanging structure, with a height and thickness of 40mm and 3mm, was successfully fabricated by the DL-PBF process, confirmed by the OM characterization of the cross-sections along the building direction. DL-PBF process has the potential to realizing the efficient integrated fabrication of WHAs with complicated structures.
