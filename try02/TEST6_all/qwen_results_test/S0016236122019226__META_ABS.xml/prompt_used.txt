You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and density functional theory investigation of the NO reduction mechanism by semichars preheated in Ar and CO2/Ar atmospheres The extensive utilization of coal-based solid fuels in thermal power plants has led to massive emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and gaseous pollutants, resulting in serious environmental issues. In this study, the NO reduction reactivity of semichars preheated in Ar and Ar/CO2 atmospheres was investigated via temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments. Based on the TPR-DTPR method, the NO initial temperature, the maximum NO reduction rate, and the NO reduction indices of different semichars were determined. Compared with CO2/Ar pretreatment, the inert pretreatment enhanced the NO reduction index of the semichar. The CO2/Ar pretreatment was beneficial for decreasing the total Raman area and the ratio of I(Gr+VL+Vr)/ID due to the preferential consumption of high-reactivity structures and the condensation of aromatic ring structures. Furthermore, the detrimental effect of CO2/Ar treatment on semichar reactivity was relevant to the volumetric fraction, exerting an extraordinary correspondence with R r. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed further to analyse the NO reduction mechanisms by semichars derived from Ar and CO2/Ar atmospheres. For the inert pretreatment, the NO reduction pathways consisted of two pathways ( path 1 and path 2 ). Path 1 was supported by thermodynamics and dynamics. The energy barrier of the rate-determining step was 280.53 kJ/mol. Owing to the difference in the evolutionary pathways of C(O) on the semichar surface, the reaction between NO and the semichars derived from the CO2/Ar atmospheres could be summarized as two pathways ( path 3 and path 4 ). Path 3 was identified as the better method, and the energy barrier of the rate-determining step was 285.39 kJ/mol. The slightly adverse effects of CO2/Ar pretreatment on NO heterogeneous reduction were determined by coupling the experimental and theoretical methods, providing new insights into nitrogen migration and transformation mechanisms.
