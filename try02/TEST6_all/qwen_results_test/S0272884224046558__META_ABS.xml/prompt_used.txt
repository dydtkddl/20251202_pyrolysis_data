You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of composite ultrafiltration membrane from fly ash microspheres and alumina nanofibers for efficient dye removal from aqueous solutions In this work, a novel type of ultrafiltration ceramic membranes with the support based on fine fly ash microspheres and selective layer based on the alumina nanofibers with an aluminosilicate binder is proposed. The average pore sizes of the support and selective layer are 0.46 μm and 29 nm, respectively. The membrane is characterized by the compressive strength of 96 MPa and water permeability of 207 L m−2 h−1 bar−1. It is shown that the binder provides structural stability of selective layer and adhesion to the support. With increasing the binder content, the water permeability increases, reaches maximum, and then slightly decreases. The developed membranes are used for ultrafiltration of Blue Dextran dyes aqueous solutions with molecular weights of 70 kDa and 500 kDa and concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/L. The dyes rejection varies in the range 97–99 %, while the permeate flux is 100–140 L m−2 h−1 at the transmembrane pressure of 4 bars. The dye retention occurs via adsorption at the initial stage, which leads to the narrowing of pore size. Further, the dye filtration proceeds mainly due to size effects. The proposed membranes can be employed for dye removal from wastewater, and also allow chemical modification by carbon coating to be employed in electrochemically assisted ultrafiltration. The developed methodology promotes the recycling of thermal energy waste and introduces novel approaches to combine waste and synthesized raw materials in the production of low-cost ceramic membranes.
