You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physicochemical structure and gasification reactivity of co-pyrolysis char from two kinds of coal blended with lignocellulosic biomass: Effects of the carboxymethylcellulose sodium To investigate the influencing mechanism of alkalis on char structure evolution and gasification reactivity during co-pyrolysis of coal and lignocellulosic biomass, carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) was selected as a typical organic sodium salt and introduced to the pyrolysis of bituminous coal (BC) and anthracite coal (AC) respectively. Physicochemical characteristics of the char samples were examined by N2 adsorption/desorption measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectra under different CMC mass ratio. Fractal theory and deconvolution method were applied to quantitatively analyze the surface morphology, pore property and microcrystalline structure of the char. Thermogravimetric analyzer and non-isothermal kinetics method were used to determine the gasification reactivity and kinetic parameters of the char. The results indicated that the addition of CMC promoted the development of pore structure from both BC and AC char samples. The fractal dimension can quantitatively describe the complexity and heterogeneity of pore structure and surface morphology of char sample. The fractal dimension obtained from SEM images of co-pyrolysis char was in range 1.41–1.68 and higher than that of the coal char, which meant CMC promoted the heterogeneity of co-pyrolysis char. Peak fitting analysis on the Raman spectra illustrated that the value of AD/AAll and AD/AG increased with the mass ratio of CMC, indicating that addition of CMC reduced the ordering of co-pyrolysis char structure. Synergistic effect was observed during the gasification process of co-pyrolysis char. The evolution of physicochemical structure and organic sodium lead to higher reactivity and lower activation energy during gasification of co-pyrolysis char than the raw coal char. This paper provides insight on the effects of organic sodium salt on products evolution during co-pyrolysis of coal and biomass.
