You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Aromatization of HDPE and PP over Ga-promoted zeolite: Effects of pretreatment and zeolite type The effects of pretreatment and structure of zeolite on aromatization of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) over different Ga-promoted zeolites (HZSM-5, hierarchical HZSM-5, HY, Hβ, and USY) were investigated. Hydrogen reduction of Ga-promoted HZSM-5 resulted in a higher yield of alkenes during HDPE pyrolysis but did not lead to increased production of total aromatic hydrocarbons. The reduction and subsequent oxidation of Ga/Z5 led to the formation of GaO+ species with high dehydrogenation activity. This resulted in a remarkable 65% yield of aromatics, with a BTEX (benzene, toluene ethylbenzene and xylene) overall yield of 60% and a selectivity of 90% of the liquid product. Increasing the Ga loading decreased the BTEX yield due to pore blockage and a decrease in the amount of Brønsted acid sites. The BTEX yield over Ga-promoted zeolites was found to be strongly related to the pore size of the zeolite, whereas its yield over the parent zeolite was not strongly dependent on the pore size. Diffusion of the cracking intermediates was found to have a more significant impact on the aromatization of PP than HDPE. The highest BTEX yield for HDPE was achieved with Ga-promoted HZSM-5, while Ga-promoted hierarchical HZSM-5 exhibited the highest BTEX yield for PP. Furthermore, Ga(1)/Hβ-Redox demonstrated remarkable selectivity (90%) towards ethylene and propylene in the gas phase, surpassing other zeolites (37%-68%).
