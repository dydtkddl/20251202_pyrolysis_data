Techno-economic analysis of the statistically optimized biodiesel production process using African pear seed oil and activated empty palm fruit bunch biocatalyst This research focuses on techno-economic analysis of the statistically optimized biodiesel production using African Pear Seed Oil and activated empty palm fruit bunch biocatalyst to ascertain the viability of producing African pear seed oil methyl ester (APSOME). Central composite design of response surface methodology (RSM) was used for the optimization of the process variables. The acid activated empty palm fruit bunch ash (AAEPFBA) catalyst used was synthesized from waste palm fruit bunch, and modified by adding H3PO4 acid in a ratio of 1:2 (g/ml). The RSM model predicted that the highest conversion yield of APSOME would be 89.3 %. The experiment performed yielded 90.1 %, which is in agreement with the predicted value at the following optimized reaction conditions: reaction temperature of 62.21 °C, time of 3.17 h, 10.2:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, 3.18 wt% catalyst concentration, and agitation speed of 326.51 rpm. It was established that the cost of labour will affect the profitability of produced APSOME. The overall result showed that AAEPFBA and APSO raw materials are viable and useful for sustainable biodiesel production.
