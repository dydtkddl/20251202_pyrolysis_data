You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

N-doped graphite encapsulated metal nanoparticles catalyst for removal of Bisphenol A via activation of peroxymonosulfate: A singlet oxygen-dominated oxidation process In this paper, a type of Ni metal and Ni3ZnC0.7 alloy nanoparticle catalyst encapsulated in N-doped graphite (NiZn@N-G-900), obtained by derivatization of metal–organic frameworks (MOF), was applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade Bisphenol A (BPA) in water. Characterizations and DFT calculations demonstrated that the encapsulation of graphite layer or N-doped graphite layer can not only adjust the surface charge distribution of the catalysts, but also improve the charge transfer ability between the catalyst and the adsorbate. These modifications were beneficial for the adsorption and activation of PMS. Based on the results of the modified radicals scavenging experiments and EPR, a typical 1O2 dominated non-radical system was proposed. Due to the characteristics of 1O2, the NiZn@N-G-900/PMS system had strong inorganic anion resistance, high selectivity and satisfactory practical application. Moreover, two pathways of BPA degradation were put forward.
