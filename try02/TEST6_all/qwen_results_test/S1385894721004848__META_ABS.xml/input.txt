N-doped graphite encapsulated metal nanoparticles catalyst for removal of Bisphenol A via activation of peroxymonosulfate: A singlet oxygen-dominated oxidation process In this paper, a type of Ni metal and Ni3ZnC0.7 alloy nanoparticle catalyst encapsulated in N-doped graphite (NiZn@N-G-900), obtained by derivatization of metal–organic frameworks (MOF), was applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade Bisphenol A (BPA) in water. Characterizations and DFT calculations demonstrated that the encapsulation of graphite layer or N-doped graphite layer can not only adjust the surface charge distribution of the catalysts, but also improve the charge transfer ability between the catalyst and the adsorbate. These modifications were beneficial for the adsorption and activation of PMS. Based on the results of the modified radicals scavenging experiments and EPR, a typical 1O2 dominated non-radical system was proposed. Due to the characteristics of 1O2, the NiZn@N-G-900/PMS system had strong inorganic anion resistance, high selectivity and satisfactory practical application. Moreover, two pathways of BPA degradation were put forward.
