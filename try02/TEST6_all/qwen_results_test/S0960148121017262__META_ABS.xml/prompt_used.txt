You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Inspecting the bioenergy potential of noxious Vachellia nilotica weed via pyrolysis: Thermo-kinetic study, neural network modeling and response surface optimization In the present study, Vachellia nilotica (VN) was valorized via thermal pyrolysis. A thermogravimetric analyzer studied the thermal degradation of VN under non-isothermal conditions. Kinetic parameters were determined using seven isoconversional methods. The Eavg was ranged from 142.15 to 166.21 kJ/mol, with the advanced isoconversional approach showing significantly better performance than general methods. Thermodynamic analysis of VN pyrolysis suggested the possibility of conversion. Neural network modeling was significantly employed to predict the value of d α / d t . The effect of temperature (350–550 °C), heating rate (10–50 °C/min), and particle size (0.1–1 mm) on process performance in terms of products yield were systematically studied and analyzed. The process variables of temperature, heating rate, and particle size were also optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The ideal operating parameters of temperature at 500 °C, and a heating rate of 25 °C/min with 0.4 mm particle size were determined and experimentally confirmed. The characteristics of the resulting product were determined using ultimate analysis, FTIR, and GC-MS, and it was discovered that the principal constituents in the VN pyrolysis process include phenolics, furfural, and dehydroacetic acid. VN has a high thermochemical conversion potential for bioenergy, as evidenced by their physicochemical properties and thermo-kinetic findings.
