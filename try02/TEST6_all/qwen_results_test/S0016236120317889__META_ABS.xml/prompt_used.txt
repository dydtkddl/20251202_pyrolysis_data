You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of softwood with waste mussel shells: Biochar analysis In this work, fisheries by-product (mussel shells) is co-pyrolyzed with forestry residues in a fast pyrolysis lab scale reactor to determine impact on biochar quality. Both mussel shells and forestry residues are waste materials with potential for the production of value added products. The pyrolysis temperature, nitrogen flow, and wood-to-mussel shell ratio (up to 50 wt%) were varied, and thermal, physical, and chemical properties of the produced biochars were investigated in a lab scale tube furnace reactor via response surface methodology (RSM). The smaller mussel shell (MS) particles decreased the surface area by filling the pores in the biochar structure. Biochars containing MS showed lower heating values, higher alkaline pH values, and higher ash content (due to the formation of CaO from CaCO3). Surface analysis showed higher functionality in co-pyrolyzed biochars, decreased hydrogen and increased nitrogen and oxygen. These properties could potentially improve adsorption of hydrophobic molecules (e.g. VOCs), acidic gases, and metal ions in aqueous solution compared to forestry biochar. Moreover, alkaline pH makes the biochar a promising additive for acidic soil.
