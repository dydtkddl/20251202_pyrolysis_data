Co-pyrolysis of softwood with waste mussel shells: Biochar analysis In this work, fisheries by-product (mussel shells) is co-pyrolyzed with forestry residues in a fast pyrolysis lab scale reactor to determine impact on biochar quality. Both mussel shells and forestry residues are waste materials with potential for the production of value added products. The pyrolysis temperature, nitrogen flow, and wood-to-mussel shell ratio (up to 50 wt%) were varied, and thermal, physical, and chemical properties of the produced biochars were investigated in a lab scale tube furnace reactor via response surface methodology (RSM). The smaller mussel shell (MS) particles decreased the surface area by filling the pores in the biochar structure. Biochars containing MS showed lower heating values, higher alkaline pH values, and higher ash content (due to the formation of CaO from CaCO3). Surface analysis showed higher functionality in co-pyrolyzed biochars, decreased hydrogen and increased nitrogen and oxygen. These properties could potentially improve adsorption of hydrophobic molecules (e.g. VOCs), acidic gases, and metal ions in aqueous solution compared to forestry biochar. Moreover, alkaline pH makes the biochar a promising additive for acidic soil.
