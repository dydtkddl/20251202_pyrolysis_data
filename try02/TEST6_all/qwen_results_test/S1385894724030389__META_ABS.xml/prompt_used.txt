You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted catalytic technology for sustainable production of valuable chemicals from plastic waste with enhanced catalyst reusability High energy consumption and catalyst deactivation hinder thermal plastic waste decomposition for chemical production. This study employs a microwave-assisted catalytic process with Ru/ZSM-5 as the catalyst for polyethylene waste. At 300 °C under the first cycle of microwave heating, gas yield reaches 90 wt%, with 23 wt% aromatics selectivity and 30 wt% light olefins selectivity. In the first cycle of thermal heating, gas yield is 72 wt%, with 67 wt% alkanes and 32 wt% light olefins selectivity. In microwave cycle reactions, gas yield remains around 88 wt% through seven cycles over the spent catalyst (without regeneration), shifting product composition to 80 wt% light olefins in the 7th cycle. In contrast, in thermal cycle reactions, catalyst activity is lost after one cycle, and gas yield drops from 72 wt% to 45 wt%. Microwave-assisted catalytic technology shows potential for economically producing valuable chemicals from plastic waste, as lower reaction temperature and high catalyst reusability.
