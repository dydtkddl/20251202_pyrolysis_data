You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Designing and advancements of Ti3C2Tx MXene for photocatalytic application Ti3C2Tx MXene has shown exponential growth in photocatalytic applications over the past few years, illustrating its ability to improve photocatalytic performance and showing great promise in the field of photocatalysis. As Ti3C2Tx MXene possesses a large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, fully exposed active sites, and abundant hydrophilic functional groups on the surface, it is highly investigated in the photocatalysis field. In the previous review, we have understood some key issues of Ti3C2Tx MXene as a photocatalytic material, especially the advantages and limitations of Ti3C2Tx MXene in photocatalytic applications. This review focuses on the competitiveness and development prospects of Ti3C2Tx MXene in photocatalysis. Firstly, the structure and properties of Ti3C2Tx MXene are introduced, including the crystal structure, electronic structure and optical properties. Secondly, the main synthesis methods of Ti3C2Tx MXene in different dimensions (3D, 2D, 1D, 0D) and the detailed operation procedure are introduced. Then the applications of Ti3C2Tx MXene in photocatalysis are introduced, including photocatalytic hydrogen production, photocatalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and water purification, photocatalytic nitrogen fixation and antimicrobial, etc. Finally, the deficiencies in the development of Ti3C2Tx MXene are proposed, and a prospective outlook on the future research is put forward.
