Evaluation of MMI/acrylate nanocomposite with hydroxyapatite as a novel paste for gap filling of archaeological bones Montmorillonite MMT/ Methyl Methacrylate-Ethyl acrylate-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate MMA/EA/HEMA terpolymeric nanocomposite was prepared through in-situ microemulsion polymerization. The produced nanocomposite was evaluated with hydroxyapatite, forming a novel paste for the gap filling of archaeological bones. Thermal ageing was used for the evaluation of prepared paste. Characterizations were carried out by FTIR; change of colour, Mechanical properties, SEM, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Antifungal activity, Density, porosity, water absorption, and wettability. The prepared MMT/ MMA-EA-HEMA terpolymer nanocomposite was produced in well-defined nanospheres with an average size of 144 nm. The results confirmed that the novel paste was very stable and had a great resistance against thermal ageing. All analysis and investigations proved that the addition of MMT/polymer nanocomposite gave good resistance to the reduction in contact angle, density, and resistance the rise in the porosity and water absorption during ageing. Microbiological studies showed that the novel paste had a good resistance against microorganisms.
