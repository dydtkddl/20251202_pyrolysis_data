You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of MMI/acrylate nanocomposite with hydroxyapatite as a novel paste for gap filling of archaeological bones Montmorillonite MMT/ Methyl Methacrylate-Ethyl acrylate-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate MMA/EA/HEMA terpolymeric nanocomposite was prepared through in-situ microemulsion polymerization. The produced nanocomposite was evaluated with hydroxyapatite, forming a novel paste for the gap filling of archaeological bones. Thermal ageing was used for the evaluation of prepared paste. Characterizations were carried out by FTIR; change of colour, Mechanical properties, SEM, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Antifungal activity, Density, porosity, water absorption, and wettability. The prepared MMT/ MMA-EA-HEMA terpolymer nanocomposite was produced in well-defined nanospheres with an average size of 144 nm. The results confirmed that the novel paste was very stable and had a great resistance against thermal ageing. All analysis and investigations proved that the addition of MMT/polymer nanocomposite gave good resistance to the reduction in contact angle, density, and resistance the rise in the porosity and water absorption during ageing. Microbiological studies showed that the novel paste had a good resistance against microorganisms.
