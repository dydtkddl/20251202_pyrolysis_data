You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Turning trash into treasure: A comprehensive review on torrefaction of refuse-derived fuel from an industrial perspective Transforming Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) into a valuable energy source holds immense promise despite the drawbacks of its high heterogeneity. Torrefaction, a promising and eco-friendly thermochemical process widely employed to enhance various bioresources, emerges as the solution to address the challenges of RDF. This review delves into a thorough assessment of torrefaction’s impact on RDF and diverse waste, evaluating the influence of process parameters on their properties. Feedstocks such as coffee waste, coffee grounds, municipal solid waste (MSW), solid recovered fuel (SRF), and agricultural waste are reviewed, alongside classifications of reactor types and the uses of torrefied RDF. Seven industrial reactor types are analyzed for their advantages and limitations. Torrefaction operates across 200–350 °C, with residence times from seconds to an hour and heating rates from 5, 10, and 20 °C/min up to 90 °C/min, adaptable for diverse feedstocks like MSW and biomass. High-temperature pyrolysis can reach 900 °C, and a heating rate of 350 °C/min, enabling rapid thermal conversion. These conditions highlight torrefaction’s flexibility and efficiency in waste-to-energy applications. The shift from fluidized bed reactors to entrained flow reactors marked a pivotal advancement, enabling efficient torrefaction of RDF into coal-like fuel for entrained flow gasifiers. This technological shift has revolutionized waste management and energy recovery by overcoming prior limitations and enhancing resource utilization. Torrefaction, integrated with gasification, has been shown to increase gasification syngas yield by 15 %, reduce O2 consumption by 20 %, and cut CO2 emissions by 70 %, significantly contributing to sustainable energy solutions and greenhouse gas reduction.
