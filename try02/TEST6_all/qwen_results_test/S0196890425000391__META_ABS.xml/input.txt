Turning trash into treasure: A comprehensive review on torrefaction of refuse-derived fuel from an industrial perspective Transforming Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) into a valuable energy source holds immense promise despite the drawbacks of its high heterogeneity. Torrefaction, a promising and eco-friendly thermochemical process widely employed to enhance various bioresources, emerges as the solution to address the challenges of RDF. This review delves into a thorough assessment of torrefaction’s impact on RDF and diverse waste, evaluating the influence of process parameters on their properties. Feedstocks such as coffee waste, coffee grounds, municipal solid waste (MSW), solid recovered fuel (SRF), and agricultural waste are reviewed, alongside classifications of reactor types and the uses of torrefied RDF. Seven industrial reactor types are analyzed for their advantages and limitations. Torrefaction operates across 200–350 °C, with residence times from seconds to an hour and heating rates from 5, 10, and 20 °C/min up to 90 °C/min, adaptable for diverse feedstocks like MSW and biomass. High-temperature pyrolysis can reach 900 °C, and a heating rate of 350 °C/min, enabling rapid thermal conversion. These conditions highlight torrefaction’s flexibility and efficiency in waste-to-energy applications. The shift from fluidized bed reactors to entrained flow reactors marked a pivotal advancement, enabling efficient torrefaction of RDF into coal-like fuel for entrained flow gasifiers. This technological shift has revolutionized waste management and energy recovery by overcoming prior limitations and enhancing resource utilization. Torrefaction, integrated with gasification, has been shown to increase gasification syngas yield by 15 %, reduce O2 consumption by 20 %, and cut CO2 emissions by 70 %, significantly contributing to sustainable energy solutions and greenhouse gas reduction.
