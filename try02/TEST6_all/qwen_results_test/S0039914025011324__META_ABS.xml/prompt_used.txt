You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green electrochemical detection of copper in alcoholic beverages using agave waste electrodes and digital twin integration The sustainable monitoring of trace metals in food and beverage production is critical for ensuring product safety, regulatory compliance, and minimizing the environmental footprint of conventional analytical methods. However, widespread adoption of electrochemical sensing in industrial settings remains limited by the reliance on non-renewable materials, high instrumentation costs, and limited integration with digital control systems. In this study, we address these challenges by developing low-cost, agave bagasse-derived activated carbon (SBET = 873 m2 g−1, –COOH functionalized) as a renewable material for carbon paste electrodes (20 % activated carbon, 80 % graphite). The resulting sensor exhibited an electroactive area of 6.69 × 10−4 cm2 and enabled sensitive copper detection at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl(sat), with a quantification limit of 60 μg L−1 and a linear range of 60–2000 μg L−1. Performance was statistically comparable to atomic absorption spectroscopy in real Tequila and Mezcal samples. To further enhance applicability, the sensor was embedded into a MATLAB-Simulink digital twin prototype for real-time simulation, predictive monitoring, and automated alerts. This work not only valorizes a major agroindustrial waste stream but also presents a digitally enabled, eco-efficient alternative to conventional techniques—reducing chemical use, energy demands, and equipment complexity—while supporting sustainable quality control in agave spirit manufacturing.
