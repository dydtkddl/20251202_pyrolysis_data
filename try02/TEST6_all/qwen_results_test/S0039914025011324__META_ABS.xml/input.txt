Green electrochemical detection of copper in alcoholic beverages using agave waste electrodes and digital twin integration The sustainable monitoring of trace metals in food and beverage production is critical for ensuring product safety, regulatory compliance, and minimizing the environmental footprint of conventional analytical methods. However, widespread adoption of electrochemical sensing in industrial settings remains limited by the reliance on non-renewable materials, high instrumentation costs, and limited integration with digital control systems. In this study, we address these challenges by developing low-cost, agave bagasse-derived activated carbon (SBET = 873 m2 g−1, –COOH functionalized) as a renewable material for carbon paste electrodes (20 % activated carbon, 80 % graphite). The resulting sensor exhibited an electroactive area of 6.69 × 10−4 cm2 and enabled sensitive copper detection at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl(sat), with a quantification limit of 60 μg L−1 and a linear range of 60–2000 μg L−1. Performance was statistically comparable to atomic absorption spectroscopy in real Tequila and Mezcal samples. To further enhance applicability, the sensor was embedded into a MATLAB-Simulink digital twin prototype for real-time simulation, predictive monitoring, and automated alerts. This work not only valorizes a major agroindustrial waste stream but also presents a digitally enabled, eco-efficient alternative to conventional techniques—reducing chemical use, energy demands, and equipment complexity—while supporting sustainable quality control in agave spirit manufacturing.
