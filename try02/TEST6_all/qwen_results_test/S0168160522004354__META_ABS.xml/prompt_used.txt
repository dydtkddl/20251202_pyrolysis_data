You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Antibacterial mechanisms of star anise essential oil microcapsules encapsulated by rice protein-depolymerized pectin electrostatic complexation and its application in crab meatballs A mixed solid matrix of the depolymerized pectin (DP) and rice protein (RP) were investigated to improve the antibacterial activity of star anise essential oil (SAEO) through microencapsulation. The encapsulation was undertaken via electrostatic complexation method followed by spray drying. Under the optimized conditions, SAEO microcapsules with 92.2 % encapsulation efficiency was acquired at 3:2 of DP-to-RP, 1:3 of DP-to-SAEO and pH 4.0. DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules exhibited a spherical-shaped particle with smaller particle size, and sustained release. FTIR and morphology analysis confirmed that SAEO was successfully encapsulated in the solid matrix of microcapsules. DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules caused the destruction of cytomembranes and reduction of membrane proteins, which led to the alteration of cell membrane fluidity and integrity. Meanwhile, DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules repressed the key enzyme in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and Hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP) cycle pathway of E. coli, S. aureus. The application experiments indicated DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules can effectively control the growth of E. coli and S. aureus in crab meatballs.
