Antibacterial mechanisms of star anise essential oil microcapsules encapsulated by rice protein-depolymerized pectin electrostatic complexation and its application in crab meatballs A mixed solid matrix of the depolymerized pectin (DP) and rice protein (RP) were investigated to improve the antibacterial activity of star anise essential oil (SAEO) through microencapsulation. The encapsulation was undertaken via electrostatic complexation method followed by spray drying. Under the optimized conditions, SAEO microcapsules with 92.2 % encapsulation efficiency was acquired at 3:2 of DP-to-RP, 1:3 of DP-to-SAEO and pH 4.0. DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules exhibited a spherical-shaped particle with smaller particle size, and sustained release. FTIR and morphology analysis confirmed that SAEO was successfully encapsulated in the solid matrix of microcapsules. DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules caused the destruction of cytomembranes and reduction of membrane proteins, which led to the alteration of cell membrane fluidity and integrity. Meanwhile, DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules repressed the key enzyme in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and Hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP) cycle pathway of E. coli, S. aureus. The application experiments indicated DP-RP/SAEO microcapsules can effectively control the growth of E. coli and S. aureus in crab meatballs.
