Bioremediation of environmental organic pollutants by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Mechanisms, methods and challenges The development of the chemical industry has led to a boom in daily consumption and convenience, but has also led to the release of large amounts of organic pollutants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, plastics, pesticides, and dyes. These pollutants are often recalcitrant to degradation in the environment, whereby the most problematic compounds may even lead to carcinogenesis, teratogenesis and mutagenesis in animals and humans after accumulation in the food chain. Microbial degradation of organic pollutants is efficient and environmentally friendly, which is why it is considered an ideal method. Numerous studies have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a powerful platform for the remediation of environmental pollution with organic chemicals due to its diverse metabolic networks and its ability to secrete biosurfactants to make hydrophobic substrates more bioavailable, thereby facilitating degradation. In this paper, the mechanisms and methods of the bioremediation of environmental organic pollutants (EOPs) by P. aeruginosa are reviewed. The challenges of current studies are highlighted, and new strategies for future research are prospected. Metabolic pathways and critical enzymes must be further deciphered, which is significant for the construction of a bioremediation platform based on this powerful organism.
