You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bioremediation of environmental organic pollutants by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Mechanisms, methods and challenges The development of the chemical industry has led to a boom in daily consumption and convenience, but has also led to the release of large amounts of organic pollutants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons, plastics, pesticides, and dyes. These pollutants are often recalcitrant to degradation in the environment, whereby the most problematic compounds may even lead to carcinogenesis, teratogenesis and mutagenesis in animals and humans after accumulation in the food chain. Microbial degradation of organic pollutants is efficient and environmentally friendly, which is why it is considered an ideal method. Numerous studies have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a powerful platform for the remediation of environmental pollution with organic chemicals due to its diverse metabolic networks and its ability to secrete biosurfactants to make hydrophobic substrates more bioavailable, thereby facilitating degradation. In this paper, the mechanisms and methods of the bioremediation of environmental organic pollutants (EOPs) by P. aeruginosa are reviewed. The challenges of current studies are highlighted, and new strategies for future research are prospected. Metabolic pathways and critical enzymes must be further deciphered, which is significant for the construction of a bioremediation platform based on this powerful organism.
