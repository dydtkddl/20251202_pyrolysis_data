You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on flame properties and molecular dynamics of MAP suppression for polyethylene dust explosion The effect of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (MAP) on polyethylene (PE) dust explosions was analyzed through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The vertical tube explosion experiments showed that the maximum propagation distance of the explosion flame decreased with the increase of MAP mass fractions. The simultaneous thermal analysis experiments revealed that the addition of MAP enhanced the thermal stability of the powder and reduced the combustion exotherm. The molecular dynamics simulation showed that in the pyrolysis system, The groups such as NH3 derived from MAP participated in and slowed down the PE decomposition process and led to the decrease of hydrocarbon gas production, such as the number of C2H4 production decreased from 161 to 112. In the combustion system, oxygen-containing groups induced the initial decomposition of PE and generated CO2 and CH2O, while MAP and its decomposition products preempted the oxygen-containing groups, resulting in the interruption of the chain reaction of PE decomposition and combustion and generating a large amount of H2O, which accounted for 26.67 % of its total generation pathways. Moreover, it was also observed from the perspective of product distribution that increasing the temperature could accelerate and deepen reactions but did not change the suppression mechanism.
