You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic effects of potassium on biomass pyrolysis, combustion and torrefaction Potassium is a natural catalyst in biomass thermochemical conversion and plays an essential role in plant’s growth. To figure out the catalytic effects of potassium on the thermochemical behaviors of biomass, the pyrolysis, combustion, and torrefaction characteristics of rubber wood are comprehensively studied using a thermogravimetric analyzer where the biomass is impregnated by potassium carbonate (K2CO3) at different concentrations. The impregnated potassium is clearly exhibited in the spectra of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, while X-ray diffraction indicate that the cellulose crystallinity decreases with increasing the potassium concentration which increases the biomass reactivity in pyrolysis. The ignition temperature of the potassium-impregnated biomass is lowered slightly when compared with the raw biomass; alternatively, its burnout temperature is reduced profoundly, suggesting that the addition of potassium into the biomass can substantially intensify its oxidative reactivity. Considering the treated biomass torrefaction, its cellulose decomposition at 250 °C is intensified, rendering a reduction in the solid yield with increasing potassium concentration. With the same mass loss at 200–300 °C, at least 28% of torrefaction time can be saved for the potassium-impregnated biomass. Accordingly, the catalytic effect of potassium on biomass thermochemical conversion is clearly outlined. Moreover, the produced potassium-rich biochar is conducive to the developments of carbon storage, soil amendment, and negative emissions technologies.
