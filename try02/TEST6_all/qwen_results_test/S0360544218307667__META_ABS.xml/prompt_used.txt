You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fractionation of liquid products from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass by stepwise thermal treatment The thermal properties of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin can be utilized to improve the characteristics of pyrolysis liquids. In this study, a concept of stepwise pyrolysis to fractionate the liquid based on the thermal properties of the biomass constituents was investigated. Lignocellulosic biomass was thermally treated in two steps: 200–300 °C followed by 550 °C. Derived liquids were studied for GC/MS analysis, water content, acid concentration and a solvent extraction method. Pyrolytic liquid derived from 550 °C after treatment at lower temperatures have a higher relative composition of phenolic compounds compared to one-step pyrolysis (increased from 58 to 90% of GC/MS peak area). Also, compounds known to promote aging, such as acids and carbonyl compounds, are derived at lower temperatures which may suppress aging in the liquid derived downstream at 550 °C. For liquids derived at 550 °C, the total acid number was reduced from 125 in one-step treatment to 14 in two-step treatment. Overall, no significant difference in the total liquid yield (sum of the liquids derived in separated treatments) nor any variations in their collective composition compared to one-step treatment at 550 °C was observed, i.e. stepwise pyrolysis can be utilized for direct fractionation of pyrolytic vapors.
