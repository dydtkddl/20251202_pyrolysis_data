You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of plastic wastes for production of fuels and value-added chemicals through pyrolysis – A review Recycling of waste plastics is a promising solution to deal with the pressure on fuel economy in forthcoming years and to address the concern regarding its accumulation in the environment. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a dominant source of plastic waste. Waste management principles can be applied for resource recovery and energy generation. Pyrolysis, a thermochemical recycling method, holds multiple advantages in relation to product utility, energy input and environmental footprint. The focus of this review is to investigate the potential of pyrolysis to convert waste plastic stream comprising of a mixture of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS) into fuel and value-added products (VAP). Concentrated efforts are made to analyse process conditions to maximize production of utilizable fractions (gas and oil) and value-added chemicals through pyrolysis. Behaviour of plastic waste components under different process conditions with reaction mechanisms in both catalytic and non-catalytic pathways are explored and summarized. Discussions on the importance of kinetic, particle and reactor scale to develop a process scheme for pyrolysis process, futuristic research directions are also presented. This paper also critically reviews utility requirements and well-established commercial process to comply with environmental legislations.
