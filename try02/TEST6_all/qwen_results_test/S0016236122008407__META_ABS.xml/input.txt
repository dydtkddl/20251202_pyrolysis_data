Numerical and experimental analysis of pyrolysis process of RDF containing a high percentage of plastic waste The current COVID-19 pandemic situation and the associated restrictions have increased the amount of generated waste. It results from the necessity to wear personal protective equipment. Thus, the disposal of masks and gloves is a topical issue and requires immediate investigation. The main aims of this work are management and environmental studies of municipal solid wastes (MSW), which have been generated during the COVID-19 pandemic time. Effective waste management in relation to a circular economy is presented. A sample of refuse derived fuel (RDF) with a high content of plastics was used for the experimental and calculation studies. Pyrolysis was selected as the best thermal decomposition process for this kind of wastes. Proximate and ultimate analyses were performed for RDF and its products. Pyrolysis was carried out using a pilot-scale reactor with acontinuous flow of 250 kg/h at 900 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis was applied during the pyrolysis investigation and showed that the main decomposition of RDF took place in the temperature range of 250–500 °C. The pyrolysis gas contained combustible compounds like CO (19.8%), H2 (13.2%), CH4 (18.9%) and C2H4 (7.1%), giving a high calorific value – 24.4 MJ/m3. The experimental results were implemented for numerical calculations. Chemkin-Pro software was applied to predict the chemical composition of the pyrolysis gas. The performed computer simulations demonstrated very good agreement with the results obtained during the experiments. They also indicated that there is a strong relationship between the chemical composition of the pyrolysis gas, the process temperature and residence time in the reactor.
