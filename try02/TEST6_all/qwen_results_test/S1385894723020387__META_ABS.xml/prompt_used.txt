You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Virtuous utilization of carbon dioxide in pyrolysis of polylactic acid Polylactic acid has been adopted as a strategic alternative to petroplastics because of its biodegradability. The waste generation rate could be proportional to its use, considering the short lifespan of polylactic acid. However, a practical disposal or recycling protocol for polylactic acid waste has not yet been developed. Thus, this study suggests a promising thermochemical platform for valorizing polylactic acid waste into energy resources (syngas). Specifically, carbon dioxide-assisted pyrolysis has been suggested to impart environmental features to polylactic acid disposal. Before the pyrolysis tests, the polylactic acid waste sample was characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectrometer and thermogravimetric analyses, which showed that polylactic acid contained a substantial amount of additives and impurities (∼13 wt%). The impurity containing polylactic acid was converted into pyrogenic gases and biocrudes through pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis was performed under carbon dioxide condition and led to enhanced carbon monoxide formation from simultaneous homogeneous reactions between CO2 and volatile organic compounds evolved from thermal degradation of polylactic acid. CO2 was reduced and the volatile compounds were oxidized. The evolution of carbon monoxide from pyrolysis under carbon dioxide condition was 2 times higher than that from nitrogen condition. The concentration of carbon monoxide from the pyrolysis of polylactic acid waste with respect to plastics and biomass was considerably higher. This observation indicates that the susceptibility of carbon dioxide to the homogeneous reaction is highly sensitive. To seek a way to hasten the homogeneous reaction, silica supported nickel catalysts were applied. The evolution of carbon monoxide from catalytic pyrolysis under carbon dioxide condition was 4.5 times higher than inert atmosphere.
