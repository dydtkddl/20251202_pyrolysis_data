You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low tar yield and high energy conversion efficiency in a continuous pyrolysis reactor with modified ribbon screw conveyor The high temperature batch and continuous pyrolysis of rice husk, sewage sludge, composite waste, hazelnut and apricot kernel shell were performed at 850 °C in a rotating batch reactor and a continuous reactor with a modified ribbon screw conveyor. Batch results were used in the continuous reactor design and comparison. At the continuous pyrolysis experiments, mixing and conveying efficiency of screw and thermal cracking performance of reactor, heated gas line and cyclone were investigated. Each material was fed into the reactor continuously with a feed rate of 4.5 kg/h for 3.5 h, and then the pipelines and reactor were monitored and collected tar and char were analyzed. The mixing unit and uninterrupted heated system showed excellent performance on tar reduction and tar yields were lower than 1.7 % for all materials. Separation of char dust from the gas without tar condensation in a heated cyclone prevented blocking in gas lines. With the secondary reactions syngas energy conversion efficiency for rice husk, sewage sludge, composite waste, hazelnut shell, and apricot kernel shell were 67.76 %, 59.22 %, 76.35 %, 56.96 %, 61.98 % respectively. With the new design with a modified ribbon screw, different types of materials were decomposed with minimum char yield in less than 15 min without mechanical problems. The high capacity of the installed reactor as 1–10 kg/h moved the technology readiness level (TRL) to 5 and set an example for demonstration in operational environment.
