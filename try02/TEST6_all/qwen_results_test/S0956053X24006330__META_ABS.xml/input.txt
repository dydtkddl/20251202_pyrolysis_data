An electricity-powered future for mixed plastic waste chemical recycling In contemporary times, global plastic waste production has doubled in comparison to two decades ago, with only 9% effectively recycled. The polymer industry is undergoing a transition to address the disparity between plastic production and end-of-life waste management. Chemical recycling offers a solution by converting plastic waste into its constituent building blocks, or monomers, which can be utilized in the production of new, high-quality plastics. This concise review provides an overview of conventional chemical recycling technologies employing heated reactors, before delving into ongoing efforts towards electrifying the chemical recycling process. A conceptual framework for a fully electrified value chain aimed at achieving plastics circularity is outlined and analyzed. Additionally, attention is given to the challenges posed by industry inertia towards adopting electrified technologies, as well as performance issues stemming from the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and the availability of long-duration renewable electricity storage options.
