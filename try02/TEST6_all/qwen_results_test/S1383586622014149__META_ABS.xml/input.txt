Effect of fractional distillation pretreatment on fuel quality of plastic waste pyrolytic oils Today, the amount of plastic waste is increasing due to the use of more plastic. Since these wastes are composed of complex chemical compounds, when they are stored, they are difficult to degrade in the air, water and soil environment and pose a serious environmental problem. One of the disposal methods of plastic waste is pyrolysis, where valuable and useful products are obtained. The pyrolytic oil products formed in the pyrolysis process can also be evaluated with their rich hydrocarbon compositions in the production of chemicals, energy production and fuel production. However, in order to evaluate this product in various fields, it would be good to improve the product quality with some pre-processes. In this study, the quality of HDPE and LDPE type pyrolytic oils was improved by fractional distillation. Distillation fractions usability as fuel was examined. By measuring the quality parameters of the bottom and distilled fraction obtained from the fraction process, its usability as gasoline (bottoms fraction) and fuel oil (distillate fraction) were evaluated according to TS EN 2177 and TS EN 228 standards, respectively. LDPE distillation efficiencies are higher than HDPE distillation efficiencies as LDPE pyrolytic oils are distilled more easily. The sulfur content of the distilled fractions obtained after distillation fell below limit values ​​and showed a positive situation in terms of the use of distilled products as gasoline. HDPE300, HDPE400, HDPE500 and HDPE600 distillate fractions provided the standard / limit values ​​given in TS EN 228 standards in terms of all parameters considered in the study. Similarly, in terms of all quality parameters considered, HDPE300, HDPE400 and LDPE500, LDPE600 and LDPE700 bottom fractions are compatible with the standard / limit values ​​given in TS 2177 standards.
