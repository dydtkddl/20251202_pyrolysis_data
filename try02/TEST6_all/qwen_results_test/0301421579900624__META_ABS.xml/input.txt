Re-examining the nature of the ECE energy problem Examination of the tasks for which energy is used and the best way for carrying out these tasks gives new insights into what types of energy supply are appropriate. This approach leads to an argument, in terms of classical economic criteria, for emphasizing the use, at least at the margin, of certain classes of already-proven renewable sources in preference to more conventional systems. This article presents preliminary results of studies, in support of this argument, for ten countries in the ECE (Economic Commission for Europe) region, which includes Eastern and Western Europe, USSR, and North America. The results suggest that careful analysis and matching of energy supply to the thermodynamic and scale structure of end-use needs is an important principle deserving close attention.
