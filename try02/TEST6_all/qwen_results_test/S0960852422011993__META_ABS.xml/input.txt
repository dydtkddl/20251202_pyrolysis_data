Biowastes for biodegradable bioplastics production and end-of-life scenarios in circular bioeconomy and biorefinery concept Due to global urbanization, industrialization, and economic development, biowastes generation represents negative consequences on the environment and human health. The use of generated biowastes as a feedstock for biodegradable bioplastic production has opened a new avenue for environmental sustainability from the circular (bio)economy standpoint. Biodegradable bioplastic production can contribute to the sustainability pillars (environmental, economic, and social). Furthermore, bioenergy, biomass, and biopolymers production after recycling of biodegradable bioplastic can help to maintain the energy-environment balance. Several types of biodegradable bioplastic, such as starch-based, polyhydroxyalkanoates, polylactic acid, and polybutylene adipate terephthalate, can achieve this aim. In this review, an overview of the main biowastes valorization routes and the main biodegradable bioplastic types of production, application, and biodegradability are discussed to achieve the transition to the circular economy. Additionally, end-of-life scenarios (up-cycle and down-cycle) are reviewed to attain the maximum environmental, social, and economic benefit from biodegradable bioplastic products under biorefinery concept.
