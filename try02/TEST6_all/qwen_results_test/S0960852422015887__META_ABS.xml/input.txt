Cellulosic pine needles-based biorefinery for a circular bioeconomy Pine needles (PNs) are one of the largest bio-polymer produced worldwide. Its waste, i.e., fallen PNs, is mostly responsible for forest fires and is a major challenge. In present article, we have reviewed differenteffortsmadeto tackle this situation. PNs have been used in various fields such asin composite, water purification industries,electronic devices, etc. Gasification is one of the appealing processes for turning PNs into bio-energy; pyrolysis technique has been employed to create various carbon-based water purification materials; saccharification combined with fermentation produced good yields of bio-ethanol; Pd or Ni/PNs biocatalyst showed good catalytic properties in variousreactionsand pyrolysis with or without catalyst is an alluring technique to prepare bio-fuel. Nano cellulose extracted from PNs showed appealing thermal and mechanical strength. The air quality of nearbyenvironment was examinedby studying the magnetic properties of PNs. Packing materials made of PNs showed exceptional ethylene scavenging abilities.
