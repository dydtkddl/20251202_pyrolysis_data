You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Binary and complex metal based nanoadsorbents for water decontamination: Mechanisms, materials, and future perspectives Water pollution due to dyes and heavy metals (HMs) demonstrate a global key challenge in the 21st century. Adsorption is considered one of the most competent techniques and metal/metal oxide nanoadsorbents have caught worldwide attention exhibiting several benefits including abundant active binding sites, tunable chemistry, functionalization, excellent regenerable capacity, and economic viability. Monometallic nanoadsorbents generally exhibit adsorption capacities between 10 mg g−1 to around 200 mg g−1 with slow kinetic rate, whereas, in comparison, bimetallic/complex nanoadsorbents depict significantly higher capacities (25 mg g−1 to around 2000 mg g−1) for the removal of dyes/HMs with rapid kinetics and > 90 % reusability over multiple cycles, depending on type of dye/metal ions, type of adsorbent and adsorption conditions. Overall, remarkable performance of binary/complex metals is evident owing to synergistic interactions between different metals of an adsorbent. Additionally, bibliometric analysis depicts a worldwide increase in interest for the exploration of bimetallic/complex nanoadsorbents, specifically after 2018. This review also facilitates deep insights into synthesis approaches, adsorption mechanisms and performances of these nanoadsorbents for the removal of dyes/HMs and proposes an eco-safe engineering roadmap for real-world deployment. The major research gaps identified from the consolidated research data involve lack of investigations under real water systems, absence of standardized characterization framework for correlation between structures and adsorption performances, and inadequate evaluation of leaching concerns, environmental impacts, and end -of-use management. Bridging these gaps through advanced modelling approaches and environmental assessment frameworks is very necessary to transform laboratory scale success into sustainable, real life water treatment applications.
