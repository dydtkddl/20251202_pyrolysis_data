You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanoplastics as emerging contaminants: A systematic review of analytical processes, removal strategies from water environments, challenges and perspective Nanoplastics (NPs) with a size of less than 1 µm have received worldwide attention as an emerging environmental pollutant. Because they are easier for organisms to absorb, they pose higher ecological and health risks than microplastics. Natural water is a significant source of nanoplastics in the environment, and it is important for both human and ecosystem health. The analysis of nanoplastics in waters is still lacking reliable and harmonized methods. Most of the studies successfully identified and removed standard reference nanoplastics from environmental samples, but they were unable to quantify nanoplastics from real field samples. Here, we reviewed studies that measured and removed nanoplastics in environmental waters, such as seawater, rivers, drinking water, wastewater, snow, and so on. Pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (py-GC–MS) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy were two common methods for analyzing nanoplastics in real samples. Mass spectrometry methods are time-consuming and cannot analyze the full nanorange due to particle size restrictions. This approach for measuring nanoplastic mass concentration may involve mistakes and require larger sample quantities. Various strategies for removing nanoplastics, including centrifugation, coagulation, filtration, flocculation, and adsorption, were reviewed. The effectiveness of nanoplastic removal is influenced by parameters such as source, size, type, and purification process. The removal efficiency for nanoplastics is 99 % when combined with filtration and coagulation processes. This study provides basic information for future research on the analysis and removal of nanoplastics from water and wastewater.
