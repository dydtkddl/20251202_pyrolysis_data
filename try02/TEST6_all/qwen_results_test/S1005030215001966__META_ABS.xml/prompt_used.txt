You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative Study on Optical Properties and Scratch Resistance of Nanocomposite Coatings Incorporated with Flame Spray Pyrolyzed Silica Modified via in-situ Route and ex-situ Route A new type of transparent scratch resistant coatings including in-situ modified SiO2 (g-SiO2) in flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process was prepared. The maximum content of g-SiO2 in the coating was 15 wt%, which is higher than that of SiO2 modified by traditional wet chemical route (l-SiO2, only 10 wt%). The results of transmission electron microscopy have demonstrated that in-situ surface modified g-SiO2 particles dispersed well with smaller agglomerates in the final coating, which was much better than the particles modified via wet chemical route. Visible light transmittance and haze tests were introduced to characterize the optical quality of the films. All coatings were highly transparent with the visible light transmittance of above 80%, especially for coatings containing g-SiO2, which exhibited slightly higher visible light transmittance than l-SiO2 embedded one. The haze value of coatings incorporated with 15 wt% g-SiO2 was 1.85%, even lower than the coating with 5 wt% l-SiO2 (haze value of 2.09%), indicating much better clarity of g-SiO2. The excellent optical property of g-SiO2 filled coatings was attributed to the good dispersion and distribution of particles. Nano-indention and nano-scratch tests were conducted to investigate the scratch resistance of coatings on nano-scale. The surface hardness of the coatings rose by 18% and 14%, and the average friction coefficient decreased by 15% and 11%, respectively, compared to the neat coat due to the addition of 10 wt% g-SiO2 and l-SiO2. The pencil hardness of the coating with 15 wt% g-SiO2 increased from 2B for the neat coating to 2H. However, the pencil hardness of coating with 10 wt% l-SiO2 was only H. The results showed that the g-SiO2 embedded coatings exhibited higher scratch resistance and better optical properties.
