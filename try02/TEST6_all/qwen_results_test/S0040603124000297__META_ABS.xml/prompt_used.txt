You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isoconversional methods: A powerful tool for kinetic analysis and the identification of experimental data quality This study explores the significance of isoconversional methods in thermal analysis and their pivotal role in evaluating the quality of experimental data. The thermal degradation of polylactic acid tannin nanocomposite and the non isothermal crystallization of poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) carbon nanotubes nanocomposites were studied. Four commonly used methods were employed to calculate activation energy (Eα) and pre-exponential factor versus the degree of conversion. The examination of error bars further contributed to evaluating the precision of calculations. The discussion covered the impact of temperature changes on data quality and highlighted the significant sensitivity to these variations. The accuracy of these measurements depends not only on factors like temperature and material quality but also on the specific mathematical method used for baseline subtraction. Isoconversional methods exhibit distinct behaviors, emphasizing the significance of precise data and analysis techniques. Temperature changes not only affect Eα but also slightly alter the curve shapes. Error bars exhibit increased sensitivity to even minor temperature changes. Missteps in baseline subtraction can lead to inaccurate results and affect the estimation of Eα. The study's overall findings highlight the necessity of stringent quality control measures to guarantee reliable and accurate kinetic analysis.
