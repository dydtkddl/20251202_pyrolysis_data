Isoconversional methods: A powerful tool for kinetic analysis and the identification of experimental data quality This study explores the significance of isoconversional methods in thermal analysis and their pivotal role in evaluating the quality of experimental data. The thermal degradation of polylactic acid tannin nanocomposite and the non isothermal crystallization of poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) carbon nanotubes nanocomposites were studied. Four commonly used methods were employed to calculate activation energy (Eα) and pre-exponential factor versus the degree of conversion. The examination of error bars further contributed to evaluating the precision of calculations. The discussion covered the impact of temperature changes on data quality and highlighted the significant sensitivity to these variations. The accuracy of these measurements depends not only on factors like temperature and material quality but also on the specific mathematical method used for baseline subtraction. Isoconversional methods exhibit distinct behaviors, emphasizing the significance of precise data and analysis techniques. Temperature changes not only affect Eα but also slightly alter the curve shapes. Error bars exhibit increased sensitivity to even minor temperature changes. Missteps in baseline subtraction can lead to inaccurate results and affect the estimation of Eα. The study's overall findings highlight the necessity of stringent quality control measures to guarantee reliable and accurate kinetic analysis.
