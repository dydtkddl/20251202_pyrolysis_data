You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tar microwave reforming over different biochar-based Ni catalysts by experiments and DFT In order to remove tars generated during biomass pyrolysis. In this study, tar steam reforming was investigated using toluene as a tar model compound and a biochar-based nickel catalyst under microwave conditions. Based on the catalyst characterization results, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the effect of different forms of nickel presence in the catalyst on toluene cracking. The experimental and simulation results indicate that the formation of Ni3S2 negatively affects the cracking of toluene. The catalyst prepared by Ni(NO3)2 impregnation demonstrated relatively good catalytic activity and stability, with 81.6 % conversion even after 190 min of pyrolysis. The ratio of water to carbon (S/C) has a significant impact on the steam reforming of toluene. A high S/C can lead to the destruction of the catalyst carbon matrix, resulting in catalyst deactivation. Conversely, a low S/C can cause a slow increase in the catalytic effect of the catalyst. The catalytic effect of the Ni(NO3)2 catalytic remains good even without the addition of water, with 78.6 % hydrogen conversion remaining at the end of 190 min pyrolysis. The addition of water molecules will inhibit the production of CH4.
