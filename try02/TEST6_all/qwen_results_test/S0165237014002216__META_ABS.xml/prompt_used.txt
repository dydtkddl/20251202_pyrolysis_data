You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of the pyrolysis step and the tanning process on KOH-activated carbons from biocollagenic wastes. Prospects as adsorbent for CO2 capture The present study deals with the influence of vegetable tanning on the chemical composition and textural properties of activated carbons obtained from a mixture of leather solid wastes by KOH activation, with or without a previous pyrolysis stage. A degreased, dehydrated skin and a mixture of commercial tannins were used as reference materials to study the effect of vegetable tanning. The data obtained by thermogravimetry indicated that the interactions between the tannin and collagen increased the thermal stability of the leather wastes, and that H2O, CO, CO2, H2, CH4, CxHy, NxOy, SO2 and toluene, were the principal gases produced during the pyrolysis. The resultant absorbent materials showed a high specific surface area and total pore volume of up to 1602m2 g−1 and V TOT: 0.695cm3 g−1, respectively. The activated carbons prepared were basically microporous with a certain degree of mesoporosity, and contained a significant amount of nitrogen. Direct chemical activation of the materials increased the volume of medium-sized micropores and the size of the micropores. The activated carbons obtained showed high CO2, low or moderate CH4 and very low H2 adsorption capacities at high pressures, most of the adsorbents being more effective in adsorbing CO2 than a commercial activated carbon used as reference (Chemviron Filtrasorb F400). These results open up the way for applying these adsorbent materials in: (i) precombustion CO2 capture to produce hydrogen in IGCC plants with a PSA process, (ii) separating/concentrating mixtures of CO2/CH4 in natural gas feeds for use as fossil fuel or (iii) natural gas storage.
