You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An experimental study of the release of nitrogen from coals pyrolyzed in fluidized-bed reactors Nitrogen release has been measured from a suite of Australian, German, and U.S. coals pyrolyzed under rapid heating conditions in two bench scale reactors. The first reactor was a single-stage fluidized bed reactor: the second was a two-stage reactor in which a fluidized bed was coupled with a tubular reactor. The two-stage reactor enabled cracking reactions of the volatiles to be studied in isolation from reactions of the char. The results show that the gas-phase N-containing species, HCN and NH3, are formed from both brown and bituminous coals. In addition, HNCO is also observed from bituminous coals: HNCO is a plausible precursor for NH3 formation. At high temperatures low-volatile coals give lower yields of HCN and NH3 than high-volatile coals. This observation, however, does not imply that tar cracking is the only source of HCN and NH3. In fact, the results obtained in the two-stage reactor suggest that a significant proportion of the HCN is released from the char and that tar cracking is not a significant source of NH3. A major part of the NH3 is produced by interactions of N-containing species with the char. These results, together with previous studies of N release, demonstrate that there is no simple relationship between N functionality in coals and the composition and rate of release of the nitrogen.
