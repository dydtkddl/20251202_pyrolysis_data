You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable recycling and upgrading of waste polytetrafluoroethylene: Current progress and prospect Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a versatile and high-performance fluoropolymer, has been widely applied to chemical industries, electronics and various other fields. However, owing precisely to the extensive and specialized range of its applications, the challenge of recycling PTFE has intensified, exerting considerable pressure and posing potential hazards to the ecological environment. Hence, the critical review presents a comprehensive and methodical overview of the current landscape of PTFE recycling technologies. It delves into an in-depth analysis of the strengths, limitations, and potential applications of each technology. Commencing with a comprehensive summary of research into mechanical recycling and radiation cracking of PTFE, the review subsequently emphasizes and explores the technological advancements in recovering monomers via PTFE pyrolysis, along with the innovative in-situ utilization of fluorine and carbon atoms for the synthesis of fluorine-containing chemicals and materials. Furthermore, the existing challenges confronting chemical recycling technologies for waste PTFE have been thoroughly discussed, and the promising prospects for the advancement of recycling technologies in the future have been outlined. It's anticipated that continuous research exploration and reasonable policy formulation will vigorously promote the development of more environmentally sustainable and economically feasible chemical upgrading technologies, thereby accelerating the process of industrializing the utilization of waste PTFE resources.
