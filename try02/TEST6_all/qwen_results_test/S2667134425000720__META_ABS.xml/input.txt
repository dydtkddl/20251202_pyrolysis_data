Frontiers and Prospects of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide in Energetic Materials: A Review Energetic materials are pivotal in both civil and military sectors, where downsizing them to the nanoscale presents a promising strategy to mitigate sensitivity while enhancing energy release efficiency. Among various fabrication techniques, supercritical fluid technology stands out due to its superior mass transfer and diffusivity. In particular, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) has emerged as an ideal medium for the safe and efficient processing of energetic materials, owing to its inertness, non-toxicity, and accessibility. This review comprehensively examines the application of key SC-CO2-based techniques—including Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions (RESS), Supercritical Antisolvent (SAS) precipitation, and Sol-Gel Supercritical Drying—in the micronization, coating, and formulation of energetic materials. We further critically discuss the prevailing challenges within this field and offer insightful perspectives on future research directions.
