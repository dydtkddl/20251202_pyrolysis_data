You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of waste tire with agricultural and forestry residues: Pyrolysis behavior, products distribution and synergistic effects Co-utilization of waste tires (WT) and agricultural and forestry residues (AFR) provides an effective means to produce energy while simultaneously providing solution for waste treatment and environment protection. In this paper, co-pyrolysis of WT and AFR (cotton stalk, CS, peanut shell, PS, and poplar branch, PB) was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS). The synergistic effects of mass loss rate and hydrocarbon content were quantified from the results of co-pyrolysis of WT with CS, PS, or PB with the weighted average of individual pyrolysis of the feedstocks. The results showed that the mass loss rate of WT with CS, PS, or PB in co-pyrolysis increased by 3.06 %, 3.84 %, and 0.61 %, respectively, compared to the weighted average of individual pyrolysis, while the hydrocarbon content increased by 19.20 %, 18.26 % and 2.97 %, respectively. The addition of AFR to WT made the pyrolysis easier. In co-pyrolysis, the amount of O-compounds decreased while that of hydrocarbons (aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons) increased. Co-pyrolysis of AFR and WT had an effect on reducing aromatic and nitrogen content. These results provide insights into the synergistic effects, from the products distribution and offer potential waste treatment method for these wastes via thermochemical conversion.
