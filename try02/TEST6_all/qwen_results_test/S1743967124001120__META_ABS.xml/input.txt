Co-pyrolysis of waste tire with agricultural and forestry residues: Pyrolysis behavior, products distribution and synergistic effects Co-utilization of waste tires (WT) and agricultural and forestry residues (AFR) provides an effective means to produce energy while simultaneously providing solution for waste treatment and environment protection. In this paper, co-pyrolysis of WT and AFR (cotton stalk, CS, peanut shell, PS, and poplar branch, PB) was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS). The synergistic effects of mass loss rate and hydrocarbon content were quantified from the results of co-pyrolysis of WT with CS, PS, or PB with the weighted average of individual pyrolysis of the feedstocks. The results showed that the mass loss rate of WT with CS, PS, or PB in co-pyrolysis increased by 3.06 %, 3.84 %, and 0.61 %, respectively, compared to the weighted average of individual pyrolysis, while the hydrocarbon content increased by 19.20 %, 18.26 % and 2.97 %, respectively. The addition of AFR to WT made the pyrolysis easier. In co-pyrolysis, the amount of O-compounds decreased while that of hydrocarbons (aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons) increased. Co-pyrolysis of AFR and WT had an effect on reducing aromatic and nitrogen content. These results provide insights into the synergistic effects, from the products distribution and offer potential waste treatment method for these wastes via thermochemical conversion.
