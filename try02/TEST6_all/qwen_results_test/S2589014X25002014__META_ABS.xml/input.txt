The influence of biochar pyrolysis temperature on anaerobic digestion of chicken litter in a leach bed coupled to a biochar filter Recent studies have shown that a dry anaerobic digestion system known as a leach bed reactor (LBR) is suitable for processing chicken litter — an abundant and problematic waste from broiler farming — and that biochar can enhance the process. The influence of biochar addition in anaerobic digestion technologies varies depending on biochar properties. This study considers the influence of wood biochar produced at different pyrolysis temperatures (450 to 900 °C) on anaerobic digestion of chicken litter in an LBR coupled to a biochar-packed anaerobic filter. The pyrolysis temperature of biochar applied as filter media did not significantly influence methane production rate and yield. However, hydrogen sulfide yield declined with decreasing biochar pyrolysis temperature. Application of 450 °C biochar reduced hydrogen sulfide yield by 30, 36 and 53% compared to biochars produced at 600, 750 and 900 °C, respectively. The presence of organic surface functional groups and capability to form liquid films on the surface of biochar are likely more important than surface area for enhancing hydrogen sulfide reduction.
