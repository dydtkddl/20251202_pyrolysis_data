You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The influence of biochar pyrolysis temperature on anaerobic digestion of chicken litter in a leach bed coupled to a biochar filter Recent studies have shown that a dry anaerobic digestion system known as a leach bed reactor (LBR) is suitable for processing chicken litter — an abundant and problematic waste from broiler farming — and that biochar can enhance the process. The influence of biochar addition in anaerobic digestion technologies varies depending on biochar properties. This study considers the influence of wood biochar produced at different pyrolysis temperatures (450 to 900 °C) on anaerobic digestion of chicken litter in an LBR coupled to a biochar-packed anaerobic filter. The pyrolysis temperature of biochar applied as filter media did not significantly influence methane production rate and yield. However, hydrogen sulfide yield declined with decreasing biochar pyrolysis temperature. Application of 450 °C biochar reduced hydrogen sulfide yield by 30, 36 and 53% compared to biochars produced at 600, 750 and 900 °C, respectively. The presence of organic surface functional groups and capability to form liquid films on the surface of biochar are likely more important than surface area for enhancing hydrogen sulfide reduction.
