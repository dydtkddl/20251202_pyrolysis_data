You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-dimensional perovskite LaNiO3 nanosheets with hierarchical porous structure for high-rate capacitive energy storage Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite-type metal oxides with ultrathin feature of nanosheets are highly promising for electrochemical energy storage applications. Here, 2D perovskite LaNiO3 nanosheet assemblies with rich pores are prepared by facile sol-gel method and subsequent heating treatment. The crystal structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of LaNiO3can be simply tuned by adjusting the heating temperature and time. The optimized sample exhibited uniform sheet-like morphology with a thickness of ∼50 nm and a large surface area and pore volume, which achieves a high specific capacitance of 139.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1, a good rate capability and an excellent cycle stability. What's more, the LaNiO3//graphene asymmetric supercapacitor device demonstrates a high energy density of 65.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.8 kW kg−1 and an outstanding cycling stability performance with 92.4% specific capacitance retention after 10000 cycles, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applications.
