You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PCDD/Fs in wet sewage sludge pyrolysis using conventional and microwave heating TG-FTIR was carried out to investigate gas evolution during pyrolysis of wet sewage sludge from Shanghai, China. Weight lost 85% in the temperature range 25–600°C while the main volatile matters were released before 600°C. To get emission characteristics of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) during pyrolysis processes, conventional pyrolysis (CP) by electric heating and microwave pyrolysis (MWP) by microwave heating were separately conducted on two set of batch reactors. Both CP and MWP evolved no more than 5% of concentration of 17 toxic PCDD/Fs in untreated sewage sludge while corresponding ratios of International Toxicity Equivalents (I-TEQ) were around 30%. The ratios of difference congeners can be well explained by distillation effect. Homologue profiles of the total PCDD/Fs indicated presence of dechlorination and distillation effects during the two processes while the effects in CP were more prominent than in MWP though the latter got higher temperature. Other to that, MWP produced equivalent quantity of PCDD/Fs compared with CP indicating the absence of “nonthermal” effect in MWP on PCDD/Fs evolution.
