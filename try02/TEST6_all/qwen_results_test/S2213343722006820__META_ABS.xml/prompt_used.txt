You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards synergistic combination of biochar/ultrasonic persulfate enhancing removal of natural humic acids from water Removal of natural organic matter (NOMs) from actual water is a major challenge in the context of worldwide pollution of natural water resources. The removal of humic acids in a system combining biochar adsorption and ultrasonic persulfate oxidation was studied in this paper. The effects of biochar addition, persulfate concentration and initial pH were investigated. A high removal rate of humic acids up to 92.5% was achieved for the combined biochar/ultrasonic/persulfate system, versus 84.0% for combined biochar/persulfate, 52.0% for sole biochar, 50.0% for combined biochar/ultrasonic, 10.0% for combined persulfate/ultrasonic, 4.0% for sole ultrasonic and 1.0% for sole persulfate systems. Ultrasonic treatment increased the removal efficiency of humic acids to 90.0% within 60 min. Mechanisms towards synergistic combination of the biochar/ultrasonic/persulfate system were investigated by gel permeation chromatography, electron paramagnetic resonance and quenching experiments together with the characterization of biochar. Hydroxyl radical and the adsorption of biochar were the major contributors to the proposed synergistic adsorption-oxidation removal mechanism, followed by the sulfate radical SO4 -·. The results of three-dimensional fluorescence diagram, fluorescence regional integration and TOC analysis indicated that the system presented promising application prospects to remove NOM pollutants from real water.
