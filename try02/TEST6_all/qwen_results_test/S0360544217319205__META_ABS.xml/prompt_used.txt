You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of pyrolysis temperature on the physicochemical properties of gas and biochar obtained from pyrolysis of crop residues Pyrolysis of crop residues is an important method to promote the utilization of biomass energy. Pyrolysis experiments of wheat straw, rice straw, corn stover, rape stalk and cotton stalk were carried out under different temperatures. The results showed that the biochar yields decreased and the gas yields increased from 300 °C to 600 °C. Besides, the proportions of CO2 and CO decreased with temperature. Higher temperatures elevated the proportions of CH4, CnHm and H2 and the higher heating values. With increasing temperature, the biochars showed decreased contents of volatile matter, H, O and (O + N)/C ratios, while increased ash, fixed carbon, C, total P and K contents. The carbon and energy conversion efficiencies of biochars decreased with increasing temperature. Significant differences were observed in the pyrolysis products among different crop residues, and some high correlations were identified among the determination parameters in the gases and biochars. At the same temperature, rice straw had the highest biochar yield, and rape stalk showed the highest gas yield and proportions of CH4, CnHm and H2 among the five crop residues. In addition, rape stalk biochar showed higher C, H and S contents and higher heating value, and cotton stalk biochar exhibited a higher fixed carbon.
