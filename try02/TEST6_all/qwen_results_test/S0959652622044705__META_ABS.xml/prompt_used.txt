You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of ultrasound pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw: From lab to semi-industrial scale In this paper, the dominance of the physical effects of ultrasound (US) pretreatment in improving the delignification of wheat straw at a 1:20 solid/liquid (biomass/water) ratio is reported showing low-frequency/high power (25 kHz, 2 or 3 kW) as preferred conditions. The sonochemical pretreatment with alkali was identified as an optimal method to make the cellulose more susceptible to further enzymatic hydrolysis, thereby increasing the yield of soluble sugars. Previous bench-scale studies have shown that US pretreatment has a positive effect on delignification, nevertheless this has not yet been demonstrated on a larger scale. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of US pretreatment for wheat straw delignification from lab to semi-industrial scale (40 kg biomass) in terms of sugar yield and energy efficiency. A 59.2% of lignin removal was recorded after the cavitational treatment of wheat straw with a subsequent 68 ± 5.7% yield in terms of enzymatic hydrolysis (52.6% glucose, 42.9% xylose and 4.5% arabinose). It was demonstrated that the positive effect of US alkali pretreatment of wheat straw on sugar yield was due to a combination of factors, including (i) an easier accessibility of the biomass carbohydrate network to enzymes due to the increased wheat straw porosity, (ii) the partial removal of lignin, which increases the relative proportion of carbohydrates in the treated biomass, and (iii) the disordering (amorphization) of the cellulose structure, which promotes carbohydrate hydrolysis as well as saponification of the acetyl groups in the hemicellulose. With respect to the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Cost Benefit Analysis the US pretreatment process herein reported was compared to an alternative Steam Explosion pretreatment. The results of the LCA analysis showed, that for all five environmental categories (energy consumption, global warming potential, water and fossil depletion, and the land occupation) the US pretreatment has advantages in comparison with the standard industrial Steam Explosion pretreatment.
