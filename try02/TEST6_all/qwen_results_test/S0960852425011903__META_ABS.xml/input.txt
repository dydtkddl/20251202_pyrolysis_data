Temperature-dependent transformation of piggery biogas residue pyrolysis products: Balancing resource recovery and environmental safety With the rapid growth of large-scale livestock farming in China, the safe disposal and resource utilization of anaerobic biogas residue (BR) have become critical challenges. This study systematically investigated the temperature-dependent (400–700 °C) transformation of piggery biogas residue pyrolysis products (biochar, tar/wood vinegar, pyrolysis gases) and their environmental risks. Results show that pyrolysis temperature significantly affects product distribution and properties: At 600 °C, biochar exhibits the maximum specific surface area (38.98 m2/g) and micropore volume (0.0034 m3/g), with heavy metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr) leaching toxicity reduced by 56.3–90.3 % and Ni stability optimized. Liquid products (tar/wood vinegar) reach the highest yield at 500 °C (16.8 %/2.9 %), but high temperatures (700 °C) promote aliphatic-to-aromatic hydrocarbon conversion. Gaseous products show increased CO (24.5 %) and H2 (21.1 %) with temperature, while CO2, CH4, and HCN decrease; toxic gases (HCN, H2S) peak at 40–60 min. Optimal conditions are recommended as 600 °C with a reaction time ≤ 60 min, balancing product performance and environmental safety. This study provides scientific basis for BR pyrolysis engineering, balancing resource recovery and environmental safety.
