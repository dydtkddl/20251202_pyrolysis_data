You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Temperature-dependent transformation of piggery biogas residue pyrolysis products: Balancing resource recovery and environmental safety With the rapid growth of large-scale livestock farming in China, the safe disposal and resource utilization of anaerobic biogas residue (BR) have become critical challenges. This study systematically investigated the temperature-dependent (400–700 °C) transformation of piggery biogas residue pyrolysis products (biochar, tar/wood vinegar, pyrolysis gases) and their environmental risks. Results show that pyrolysis temperature significantly affects product distribution and properties: At 600 °C, biochar exhibits the maximum specific surface area (38.98 m2/g) and micropore volume (0.0034 m3/g), with heavy metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr) leaching toxicity reduced by 56.3–90.3 % and Ni stability optimized. Liquid products (tar/wood vinegar) reach the highest yield at 500 °C (16.8 %/2.9 %), but high temperatures (700 °C) promote aliphatic-to-aromatic hydrocarbon conversion. Gaseous products show increased CO (24.5 %) and H2 (21.1 %) with temperature, while CO2, CH4, and HCN decrease; toxic gases (HCN, H2S) peak at 40–60 min. Optimal conditions are recommended as 600 °C with a reaction time ≤ 60 min, balancing product performance and environmental safety. This study provides scientific basis for BR pyrolysis engineering, balancing resource recovery and environmental safety.
