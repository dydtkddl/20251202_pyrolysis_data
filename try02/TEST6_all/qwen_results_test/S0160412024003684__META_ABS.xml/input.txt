Snow dumping station – A considerable source of tyre wear, microplastics, and heavy metal pollution Snow dumping stations can be a hotspots for pollutants to water resources. However, little is known about the amount of microplastics including tyre wear particles transported this way. This study investigated microplastics and metals in snow from four snow dumping stations in Riga, Latvia, a remote site (Gauja National Park), and a roof top in Riga. Microplastics other than tyre wear particles were identified with Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) (>500 µm) and focal plane array based micro-Fourier Transform Infrared (FPA-µFTIR) imaging (10–500 µm), tyre wear particles by Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (Py-GC–MS), and total metals by Inductively Coupled Plasma with Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Microplastics detected by FTIR were quantified by particle counts and their mass estimated, while tyre wear particles were quantified by mass. The concentrations varied substantially, with the highest levels in the urban areas. Microplastic concentrations measured by FTIR ranged between 26 and 2549 counts L−1 of melted snow with a corresponding estimated mass of 19–573 µg/L. Tyre wear particles were not detected at the two reference sites, while other sites held 44–3026 µg/L. Metal concentrations varied several orders of magnitude with for example sodium in the range 0.45–819.54 mg/L and cadmium in the range 0.05–0.94 µg/L. Correlating microplastic measured by FTIR to metal content showed a weak to moderate correlation. Tyre wear particles, however, correlated strongly to many of the metals. The study showed that snow can hold considerable amounts of these pollutants, which upon melting and release of the meltwater to the aquatic environment could impact receiving waters.
