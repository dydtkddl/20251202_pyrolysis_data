You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solid raney-type Ni foam catalysts for xylitol production: Continuous and batch operation Solid activated metal foam catalysts represent a promising alternative for the continuous production of valuable sugar alcohols. Traditionally, sugar alcohols are produced industrially in batch mode using finely dispersed Raney-type nickel catalysts. In this study, novel solid foam Raney-type Ni catalysts (activated metal foam catalysts) were used for the hydrogenation of xylose to xylitol in both batch and continuous operation. Two types of catalysts were investigated: Raney-type Ni foam (Metalyst® MC 911 by Evonik Operations GmbH, Ev-F-Ni) and Raney-type Ni foam promoted with molybdenum (Metalyst® MC 981 by Evonik Operations GmbH, Ev-F-NiMo). Catalyst deactivation was primarily attributed to the accumulation of strongly adsorbed organic species on the active sites and to Ni and Al leaching, which reduced the availability of catalytically active sites. Ev-F-NiMo demonstrated a superior stability and activity compared to Ev-F-Ni, attributed to electronic interactions between Mo and Ni, which stabilize Ni in a lower oxidation state and reduce metal leaching under reaction conditions. In continuous operation, the catalysts exhibited reduced deactivation, likely due to enhanced desorption of poisons under the continuous flow of fresh feed. Although the exposure to xylonic acid, a potential poison forming on the catalyst surface, temporarily reduced the xylitol yield in continuous mode, the Ev-F-NiMo catalyst demonstrated good resilience, recovering its activity after the removal of the poisoning species. These results highlight the very attractive technical solution for the continuous production of sugar alcohols from sugar monomers, utilizing promoted Raney-type Ni catalyst that is highly active, selective and cost-effective.
