Valorization of polyethylene waste via chemical looping gasification using high-entropy oxide oxygen carriers The conversion of plastic waste into hydrogen-rich syngas via chemical looping gasification (CLG) represents a promising route toward sustainable resource recovery. In this study, a high-entropy spinel oxide, (FeNiCoCrMn)3O4, was synthesized via the sol–gel method and evaluated as both an oxygen carrier (OC) and catalyst for the CLG of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Compared to conventional low-entropy oxides (LEO) (e.g., NiFe2O4), the high-entropy oxide (HEO) exhibited superior redox performance, yielding hydrogen-rich syngas with a hydrogen content of 75.6 %, syngas yield of 69.36 mmol/g HDPE, and H2/CO ratio of 8.78, alongside an H2 conversion efficiency of 81.5 %. Moreover, the HEO exhibited excellent cyclic stability, with no noticeable performance degradation observed after 20 consecutive redox cycles. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the lattice distortion, and high configurational entropy, which collectively promote the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, maintain single-phase spinel stability, and provide abundant active sites for hydrocarbon cracking and reforming. Post-reaction analyses revealed the formation of Fe-Ni-Co alloy phases and filamentous carbon structures, confirming the material’s catalytic cracking capability. This work demonstrates the potential of HEOs as next-generation OCs for efficient plastic waste valorization and advances the rational design of multi-component materials in CLG systems.
