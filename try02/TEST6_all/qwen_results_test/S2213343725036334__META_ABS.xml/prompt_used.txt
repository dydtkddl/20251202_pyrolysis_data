You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of polyethylene waste via chemical looping gasification using high-entropy oxide oxygen carriers The conversion of plastic waste into hydrogen-rich syngas via chemical looping gasification (CLG) represents a promising route toward sustainable resource recovery. In this study, a high-entropy spinel oxide, (FeNiCoCrMn)3O4, was synthesized via the sol–gel method and evaluated as both an oxygen carrier (OC) and catalyst for the CLG of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Compared to conventional low-entropy oxides (LEO) (e.g., NiFe2O4), the high-entropy oxide (HEO) exhibited superior redox performance, yielding hydrogen-rich syngas with a hydrogen content of 75.6 %, syngas yield of 69.36 mmol/g HDPE, and H2/CO ratio of 8.78, alongside an H2 conversion efficiency of 81.5 %. Moreover, the HEO exhibited excellent cyclic stability, with no noticeable performance degradation observed after 20 consecutive redox cycles. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the lattice distortion, and high configurational entropy, which collectively promote the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, maintain single-phase spinel stability, and provide abundant active sites for hydrocarbon cracking and reforming. Post-reaction analyses revealed the formation of Fe-Ni-Co alloy phases and filamentous carbon structures, confirming the material’s catalytic cracking capability. This work demonstrates the potential of HEOs as next-generation OCs for efficient plastic waste valorization and advances the rational design of multi-component materials in CLG systems.
