Inactivation of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase in whole wheat flour using atmospheric cold plasma treatment: Kinetics, mechanism, and impact on its compositional properties This study examines polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) inactivation in whole wheat flour (WWF) using atmospheric cold plasma (5–25 kV/1–10 min) and steam treatment (100 °C/1–6 min) while assessing the changes in enzyme structure. Cold plasma at 25 kV/10 min and steam at 100 °C/6 min achieved ≥99 % inactivation of PPO and POD. The inactivation followed nth-order kinetics, with orders of 1.15 for PPO and 1.1 for POD under cold plasma exposure. PPO was more resistant than POD in WWF. Both treatments increased random coil content, confirming enzyme unfolding. Increasing plasma exposure led to higher optical emission intensities of reactive nitrogen species (328–426 nm), hydroxyl radicals (314 nm), and oxygen molecular bands (739 and 778 nm). Cold plasma at 25 kV/10 min preserved the color and proximate composition of WWF. These findings highlight cold plasma's potential as a non-thermal alternative for PPO and POD inactivation while maintaining WWF's compositional integrity.
