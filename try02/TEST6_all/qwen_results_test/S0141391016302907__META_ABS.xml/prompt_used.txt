You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Self-extinguishing bio-based polyamides The fireproofing study of polyamide 11 (PA11), a bio-based polyamide synthesized from castor oil and marketed under the trade name Rilsan® is presented. As an interesting perspective, FR can be chemically linked to the PA backbone. In this way, we achieved the synthesis of a dicarboxylic acid from DOPO cycle (9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide). This phosphorus diacid derivative was able to react by polycondensation to give rise of new copolyamides (coPA) bearing phosphorus moieties attached to the PA backbone with 15,000–30,000 g/mol as molar masses. The amount of phosphorus and the viscosity of the final PA were optimized. Thermal properties such as thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were evaluated and were shown crystallinity and degradation typical of linear PA11. UL94-V0 ranking coupled with high Oxygen Limit Indexes (LOI = 40) were also obtained. Pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimeter (PCFC) and cone calorimeter were performed to understand the mode-of-action of the new phosphorus-containing FR used to obtain self-extinguishing bio-based PA11. Lastly, the preserving of mechanical properties was highlighted.
