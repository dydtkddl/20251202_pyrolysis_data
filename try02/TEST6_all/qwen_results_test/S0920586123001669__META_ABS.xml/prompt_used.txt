You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of porosity and acidity in the catalytic upcycling of polyethylene Plastics have become fundamental and widespread materials in our everyday life. Nowadays, the most demanded plastics are polyolefins, accounting for nearly half of the Global plastic production. However, the end-of-life disposal of these materials is an issue inevitably connected to their increased production. Among chemical recycling techniques, the most thoroughly investigated process is the catalytic pyrolysis, showing a vast panorama of different set-ups optimized for the major production of either gaseous or liquid compounds. In this contribution a series of mesoporous silica-based materials, either pure SiO2 or substituted with Zr and Al, were systematically synthetized varying both porous framework and surface acidity, in the attempt of rationalizing the effect of each parameter (deeply characterized by physico-chemical methods) on the catalytic pyrolysis of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). The synthetized materials together with some zeolites and aluminas reference samples were tested towards LLDPE degradation in a batch reactor set-up optimized for the formation and accumulation of the gaseous compounds, coupled with IR spectroscopy for in situ monitoring the evolution of the most abundant species (mostly propylene and branched C4-C6 olefins, together with a minor fraction of ethylene and short hydrocarbons). This work points out the necessity of the presence of Brønsted acid sites for a good activity (in terms of both the yield of gaseous products and lowering of the process temperature), but it also reveals a non-negligible role of the Lewis acid sites and it warns about the importance of controlling not only the amount of acid sites but also their strength.
