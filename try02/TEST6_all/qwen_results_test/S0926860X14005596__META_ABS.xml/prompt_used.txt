You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing the distribution of aromatic products from catalytic fast pyrolysis of cellulose by ZSM-5 modification with boron and co-feeding of low-density polyethylene This study investigated the effects of ZSM-5 impregnation with boron on its catalytic properties in catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of cellulose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and their mixtures. A series of boron-modified ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by impregnating a conventional ZSM-5 with different boron loadings (0.5–3wt.%). Due to boron deposition, the acidity and pore size of ZSM-5 decreased with increasing the boron loading. When impregnated with 1wt.% boron, ZSM-5 preserved sufficient catalytic activity for the production of valuable monoaromatic hydrocarbons and decreased the formation of undesired polyaromatic hydrocarbons in CFP of cellulose. In addition, the pore narrowing of ZSM-5 by boron deposition greatly enhanced p-xylene production over m- and o-xylenes in CFP. This result indicates that slightly decreasing the pore size of ZSM-5 can improve aromatic distribution toward more valuable products in CFP. Co-feeding of cellulose with LDPE in CFP further improved the product distribution. As a result of boron modification and co-feeding, the monoaromatic yield increased from 20.0 C% for CFP of cellulose alone with the parent ZSM-5 to 24.6 C% for co-feed CFP of cellulose and LDPE mixture (mixing ratio of 4:1) with the boron-modified ZSM-5, while the polyaromatic yield decreased from 11.3 C% to 6.0 C%. The yield for p-xylene also increased from 2.23 C% to 5.57 C% while the selectivity increased from 47.9% to 75.2%. The results indicate that ZSM-5 modification with boron and co-feeding of plastics have a beneficial effect for improving aromatic product distribution in CFP of biomass.
