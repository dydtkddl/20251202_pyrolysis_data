You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of water treatment sludge waste by application as supplementary cementitious material This paper investigates the potential of using calcined water treatment sludge to the development of supplementary cementitious material. Sludge samples have been collected in the drying beds of a water treatment plant located in Southern Brazil and calcined in the laboratory. Chemical and mineralogical characterization has been performed through energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction with crystalline phases quantified by Rietveld refinement. Morphological analysis has been supported by scanning electron microscope images. Physical characterization has been carried out through specific surface area, particle size distribution, and pozzolanic activity performance with Portland cement. Results have shown that the water treatment sludge is a non-hazardous and non-inert waste without environmental restrictions for use in construction. Considering technical, environmental and economic aspects related to energy consumption, sludge samples calcined at 600 °C for 1 h present the most promising results regarding the production of supplementary cementitious material equivalent to a normal pozzolan, while highly active pozzolan requires 750 °C for 1 h. Calcined water treatment sludge showed great technical and environmental potential to be used as an alternative source of supplementary cementitious material in the near future.
