You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nearly complete depolymerization of untreated post-consumer plastic with an immobilized and reusable PET hydrolase The accumulation of plastics in the environment has become a serious concern for the entire society. In recent years, enzyme-based biodegradation has emerged as a promising and sustainable strategy for the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), one of the most widely used polyester plastics. However, the translation of these technologies to the industrial field faces several underexplored challenges, including the immobilization and reusability of the biocatalysts. Here, we present the use of IC-Tagging as a novel one-step methodology for the “in cellulo” self-immobilization of the benchmark PET-degrading enzyme LCCICCG in protein nanospheres. The immobilized enzyme showed to be active against soluble substrates and exhibited improved thermal resistance and long-term storage stability, retaining 58 % of relative activity after 3 months at room temperature. Immobilized LCCICCG also demonstrates remarkable reusability, with minor activity loss up to 10 reuse cycles. Most importantly, nearly complete depolymerization (>90 %) of various untreated amorphous post-consumer PET materials was achieved at a wide range of temperatures (50–70 °C) by removing the products and reusing the enzyme repeatedly. Furthermore, reutilization led to almost full degradation of two consecutive batches of post-consumer PET in 6 days, outperforming all immobilized biocatalysts reported at laboratory scale. Overall, IC-Tagging emerges as a promising and versatile platform for the production, immobilization and reutilization of top-performing PET hydrolases, contributing to sustainable management of plastic waste.
