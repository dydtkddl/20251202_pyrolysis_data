Transforming kitchen waste into clean energy: Experimental and simulation studies on component synergies in pyro-gasification Pyro-gasification of kitchen waste (KW) offers a sustainable route to produce hydrogen-rich syngas and ease waste management, yet thermal variability, component synergies, and safe operation remain underexplored. In this study, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Aspen Plus simulations were integrated to quantitatively investigate component synergies among rice, pork, and cabbage (5:2:3 by mass) during KW pyro-gasification. TGA results revealed three synergistic pyrolysis stages: Stage I (162–275 °C) dominated by cabbage, with a DTG peak of 3.66 %/min; Stage II (275–392 °C) exhibiting strongest synergy—DTG peak of 21.06 %/min (≈ 15 % above theoretical sum); Stage III (392–814 °C) driven by pork and cabbage, achieving a maximum volatile release of 79.42 %. Aspen Plus simulations across 100–1000 °C, 0.1–1.0 MPa and ER 0.1–1.0 pinpointed steam gasification at 750 °C, 0.6 MPa and ER 0.5, yielding 74.16 % H₂ and a low heating value of 18 242.90 kJ/m3. This integrated TGA and simulation study quantitatively assesses KW component synergies and defines the temperature–pressure window that maximizes H2 yield while controlling volatile release, offering kinetic insights and engineering parameters for safe, efficient waste-to-energy conversion.
