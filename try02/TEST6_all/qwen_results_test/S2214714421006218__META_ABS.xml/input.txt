Recent advances in circular bioeconomy based clean technologies for sustainable environment The term “circular bioeconomy-based clean technologies” has attracted global attention in recent years, and it now plays an important role in solving issues of increasing biowaste generation, resource scarcity and climate change. This is in line with creating a sustainable environment. Regarding circular bioeconomy-based technologies, wastewaters and solid biowastes are treated as potential and renewable feedstocks for producing value-added resources and bioenergy. Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are promising technologies for the treatment of wastewater and conversion of wastes to bioenergy and resources by microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs). Biowastes from various sectors, including organic fraction of municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, animal manure, food wastes and sewage sludge, can be converted to biochar, biofuel and other valuable products via thermochemical technologies. This research explains some representative circular bioeconomy based technologies for the treatment of wastewater and biowastes while focusing on the impact of these technologies and products on environmental sustainability.
