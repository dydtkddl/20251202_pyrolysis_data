A review on synthesis, properties and prospective applications of carbon nanomaterials Carbon nanoparticles have gained popularity in nanotechnology because of their numerous valuable qualities, including their remarkable shape and favorable mechanical properties. Due to these characteristics, carbon nanomaterials are versatile and are able to be used in a wide range of seemingly unrelated sectors. They function as adsorbents to reduce pollutants at one end of the spectrum and as effective carriers of medication agents in therapeutic applications at the other. Although there are evident advantages, there are a number of difficulties in the synthesis of carbon nanoparticles. However, their wide variety of applications and significant advantage over other available nanoparticles make them a fascinating research topic that necessitates a thorough examination. As per our best knowledge, this is one of the simplified reviews on graphene, which covers the understanding of almost every field so that new researchers can get knowledgeable benefits in the context of graphene and its nanomaterials. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of carbon nanomaterials from their origins to their numerous uses by using a modern method for literature evaluation.
