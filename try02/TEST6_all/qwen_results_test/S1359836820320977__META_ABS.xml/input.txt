Synergy effect between quaternary phosphonium ionic liquid and ammonium polyphosphate toward flame retardant PLA with improved toughness The development of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites having flame retardancy, tensile toughness and transparency is the state-of-the-art, which requires meticulous selection and combination of additives. To achieve this goal, an ionic liquid (IL) tetrabutylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate is synthesized and used as a synergist for ammonium polyphosphate (APP). Due to the high synergistic effect between them, only 1.5 wt% IL and 1.5 wt% APP (total amount of 3 wt%) can endow PLA with fire safety, i.e. limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 27.2, UL 94 V-0 rating and low heat release rate of 290 kW m− 2. Besides, the elongation at break of PLA containing 3 wt% IL/APP increases from 8.5% of PLA to 204.6%. Meanwhile, the incorporation of IL/APP has tiny impact on the transparency of PLA. The PLA/IL/APP possessing toughness and flame retardancy shows great potentials in the fields of packaging, automotive and electronic and electric industry in the future.
