You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergy effect between quaternary phosphonium ionic liquid and ammonium polyphosphate toward flame retardant PLA with improved toughness The development of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites having flame retardancy, tensile toughness and transparency is the state-of-the-art, which requires meticulous selection and combination of additives. To achieve this goal, an ionic liquid (IL) tetrabutylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate is synthesized and used as a synergist for ammonium polyphosphate (APP). Due to the high synergistic effect between them, only 1.5 wt% IL and 1.5 wt% APP (total amount of 3 wt%) can endow PLA with fire safety, i.e. limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 27.2, UL 94 V-0 rating and low heat release rate of 290 kW m− 2. Besides, the elongation at break of PLA containing 3 wt% IL/APP increases from 8.5% of PLA to 204.6%. Meanwhile, the incorporation of IL/APP has tiny impact on the transparency of PLA. The PLA/IL/APP possessing toughness and flame retardancy shows great potentials in the fields of packaging, automotive and electronic and electric industry in the future.
