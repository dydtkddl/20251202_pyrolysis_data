From wastewater to sludge: The role of microplastics in shaping anaerobic digestion performance and antibiotic resistance gene dynamics The presence of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) disrupt processes and threaten the effectiveness of anaerobic digestion (AD), raising critical environmental and operational concerns. This review assesses MP occurrence in WWTPs and its effects on biogas production and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during AD to understand their impact on process efficiency and environmental health. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) are the most prevalent types of MPs which are found in WWTP influent at an average concentration of 801.5 particles per liter (P/L), decrease to 38.3 P/L in effluent, and accumulate in sludge at 70.5 P/L. The effect of MPs on AD performance is influenced by MP type, concentration, size, and AD conditions (i.e., feed substrate, reactor configuration, temperature, and incubation time). For example, certain MPs (polyamide 7 (PA7) and PP) increase methane production by 39.5 %, while aged MPs decrease it by 47.2 %. The review also explores how AD drives MP degradation mechanisms like oxidation, hydrolysis, mechanical stress, and biodegradation. Additionally, MPs significantly impact ARGs, with abundance increasing by 0.4–514.4 %, especially with aged MPs. Mechanistic effects of MPs on ARGs dissemination were also discussed, including horizontal gene transfer (reactive oxygen species production, cell membrane permeability, extracellular polymeric substances secretion, and ATP dynamics), vertical gene transfer, microbial community, and adsorbing pollutants. This analysis provides insights into the complex interactions between MPs, microbial processes, and ARGs, highlighting their implications for wastewater treatment and biogas production systems.
