Electromagnetic interference shielding properties of wood-based composites incorporating in situ synthesized NiFe2O4 spinel ferrite Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing wood-based composites for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding due to their unique porous and sustainability. This study investigates the potential of using wood as a matrix material to enhance EMI shielding performance by incorporating function materials into its natural channels. Specifically, we developed a novel wood-based composite by in situ incorporation of NiFe2O4 spinel ferrite into the wood’s porous structure, resulting in an innovative EMI shielding material with tailored magnetic and structural properties. A detailed evaluation of the composites’ structural, morphological, magnetic, and electromagnetic characteristic, as well as their thermal stability, was conducted. The wood@NiFe2O4 composite, with a thickness of only 1 mm, demonstrate an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness of 30.4 dB in the X-band. This work not only advances the development of sustainable, biomass-derived EMI shielding materials but also paves the way for reducing reliance on conventional, non-renewable, and costly materials for electromagnetic protection, offering a more enviromentally friendly and cost-effective solution.
