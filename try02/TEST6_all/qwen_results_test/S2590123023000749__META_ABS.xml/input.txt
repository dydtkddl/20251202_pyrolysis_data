Optimization of pyrolysis conditions for production of rice husk-based bio-oil as an energy carrier Bio-oil is an eco-friendly energy source with potential to substitute fossil-derived fuels. This study optimized pyrolysis conditions for production of bio-oil from rice husks. Response surface methodology based on central composite design was employed to maximize bio-oil yield and high heating value (HHV) while minimizing water and ash contents. The pyrolysis process conditions were; temperature (400–650 °C), heating rate (6000–9750 °Ch-1), and holding time (600–1800 s). Analysis of variance revealed that the linear model best fits the responses of bio-oil yield and water content. On the other hand, the quadratic model best fits the responses of HHV and ash content. Pyrolysis temperature had the greatest influence on each of the studied responses, followed by holding time and lastly heating rate. Optimum pyrolysis conditions were found to be; temperature (650 °C), heating rate (9750 °Ch-1), and holding time (1800 s), leading to bio-oil yield, HHV, water and ash contents of 38.13%, 23.40 MJ/kg, 18.27%db and 0.16%db, respectively. These results fall in the range of standard quality values for bio-oil in published literature where >15 MJ/kg, 20–30%, 0.15–0.25% are the recommended ranges for HHV, water and ash contents, respectively. Results from the FTIR spectroscopy revealed that phenolic compounds contributed the most to bio-oil composition. Phenolic compounds positively influenced the quality of bio-oil due to their high calorific values. Gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry results showed peaks continuing to spill up to the maximum retention time indicating good thermal stability and bio-oil quality.
