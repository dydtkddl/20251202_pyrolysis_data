You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic models of catalytic cracking of oil fractions in single-stage and multistage reactors with fluidized beds and interpretation of experimental data of catalytic cracking performed in these reactors This article presents kinetic models for the catalytic cracking of oil fractions in single-stage and multistage fluidized countercurrent flow-type reactors. The models are based on the evaluation of the hydrodynamic conditions in the fluidized beds, using theoretical equations and concrete experimental data. The derivation of theoretical equations assumes that in the fluidized beds of the two flow-type reactors all the ingredients of the systems are in a backmix flow. On the basis of these models and experimental data we have calculated the values of the apparent reaction rate constants which permit the quantitative evaluation of the influence of the following: (1) the number of fluidized stages in the reactor, (2) the temperature of the process, (3) the fractional composition and nature of the oil fractions, (4) the dilution of the reacting substance (oil fractions) with the products of its conversion, (5) the mean diameter of the particles of catalyst, and (6) the extent of irreversible deactivation of the activity of the catalyst by poison. It is shown that the kinetic models and calculated values of the apparent reaction rate constants allow: (7) the determination of the weight of catalyst necessary to achieve a specified degree of conversion of the oil fractions in the reactor, (8) the evaluation of the reproducibility of the results of the process, and (9) the appreciation of how the efficiency of the reactor changes when its geometrical dimensions increase.
