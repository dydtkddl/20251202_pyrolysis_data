You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergetic effects during co-pyrolysis of waste textiles and Ca/Fe-rich industrial sewage sludge: Reaction kinetics and product distribution Co-pyrolysis is a promising technology for industrial organic waste to utilize their unique resource and energy properties for efficient conversion into valuable products. This study was the first time to characterize the co-pyrolysis of waste textiles with Ca-rich industrial sludge and Fe-rich industrial sludge on a laboratory-scale fixed bed. The properties, mechanisms, gas, oil and carbon production were investigated as a function of temperature and mixing type. Co-pyrolysis increased the total weight loss from 50.05 % to 69.81 % for Ca-rich industrial sludge mixed with 50 % waste textiles and from 49.13 % to 70.01 % for Fe-rich industrial sludge mixed with 50 % waste textiles. The activation energy of co-pyrolysis was approximately 50 % lower compared to the pyrolysis of waste textiles alone. The optimal reaction model for the different reaction stages for all samples was three diffusion (D3). Co-pyrolysis resulted in lower CO and CO2 emission temperatures of about 25–110 °C and produced more short-chain organic compounds (C < 10). Co-pyrolysis produced more aldehydes and ketones organics. Moreover, co-pyrolysis char exhibited an elevated level of fatty alkyl side chains and bridge branching, as well as higher degrees of aromatization and stability. This study offers valuable insights into the potential application of pyrolysis for the management of Ca/Fe-rich industrial sludge and waste textiles, thereby serving as a basis for future utilization endeavors.
