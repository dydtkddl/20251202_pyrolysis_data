You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of process parameters for microwave pyrolysis of oil palm fiber (OPF) for hydrogen and biochar production Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) is used to investigate the optimized experimental conditions for maximum H2 and biochar yields from microwave pyrolysis of OPF. Input parameters (temperature, microwave power and N2 flow rate) have been coded which suggest a complete summary of experimental design with a set of experiment for the two responses of H2 and biochar. Quadratic model has been found fit for the optimization. This method significantly reduces the number of the experiments (Full factorial experiments). Actual vs. predicted plots clearly imply that experimental values are well in agreement with the predicted values for both H2 and biochar yield. The perturbation plots indicate that H2 and biochar yields are more sensitive for N2 flow rate and temperature respectively. The software suggested three optimized experimental conditions for maximum H2 yield, maximum biochar yield and for both maximum H2 and biochar yields together. The software results were further validated by conducting relevant experiments. The error was less than 10%, suggesting that the software predictions are quite reliable. Proximate and ultimate analysis of the optimized biochars have showed a big percentage of carbon contents (More than 60wt.%) and high heating value. SEM and BET analysis show some pores in the biochars which are effective for soil improvements.
