You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Collaborative optimization for the performance of ZnO/biochar composites on persulfate activation through plant enrichment-pyrolysis method A novel method of plant enrichment for ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and pyrolysis was employed to gain the ZnO/biochar (ZnO/BC) composites. Comparing to pristine biochar and two zinc oxides/biochar composites obtained by conventional metal salts impregnation method, here the ZnO/BC exhibited distinct advantages in persulfate (PS) activation for tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) degradation. The activation mechanism analysis revealed that PS accepted electrons from persistent free radicals (PFRs) in ZnO/BC to directly or indirectly generate sulfate radicals ( S O 4 ∙ - ) and hydroxyl radicals ( H O ∙ ). Coincidentally, ZnO NPs promoted the secretion of total phenols and flavonoids, as precursors of PFRs, which accelerated the formation of more oxygen-centered PFRs with stronger catalytic ability and longer half-life. Moreover, owing to the tight combination of ZnO NPs with internal structures of the plant, higher porosity and large specific surface area in the biochar composites were favorable for reducing the electrochemical impedance of ZnO/BC, which could effectively facilitate the electron transfer process between PFRs and PS. Meanwhile, due to the injection of electrons during PFRs formation, slight narrow in the bandgap brought about the mild enhancement of photocatalytic properties for ZnO NPs. Overall, the method in this research not only provided a new strategy to acquire metal oxide/biochar composites with catalytic ability, but also opened up a novel way to collaboratively optimize the performance of biochar matrix and metal nanoparticles.
