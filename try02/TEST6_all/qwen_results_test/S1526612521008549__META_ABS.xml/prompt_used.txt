You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Post fabrication thermomechanical processing of additive manufactured metals: A review In this review paper, studies involving process combinations between metal additive manufacturing (MAM) and post-MAM metal forming are reviewed to provide a summary of recent trends, applications, and challenges involved in hybrid (a combination of MAM and metal forming) manufacturing. Unlimited design flexibility, mass customization, reduction of expensive forming steps and material waste, production of dense metal parts at reduced manufacturing costs and time are the significant benefits offered by hybrid manufacturing (additive + conventional). Applicable thermomechanical processing (TMP), e.g. isothermal forging, hot rolling, hot extrusion, how and when they should be performed, and their impact on the evolution of structure and property of the additively manufactured parts is focused particularly. Extensive discussions on the microstructure and mechanical properties of additive manufactured preforms upon the application of TMP are carried out which impact the application ranges of these parts in the first place. Overall, this paper provides an attentive overview of the characterization of the material and process relationship combining material and manufacturing knowledge to optimize the right process for the right application that will serve as a benchmark for future research and development in manufacturing of metallic components with the combined effort of MAM and metal forming.
