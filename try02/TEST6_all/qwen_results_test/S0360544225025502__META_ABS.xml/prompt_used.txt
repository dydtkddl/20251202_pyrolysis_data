You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene to produce sustainable aviation fuel fractions: Improving isomerized alkane selectivity via magnetic metal-modified HY zeolites To produce isomerized sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fractions through plastic wastes' atmospheric pyrolysis is rarely reported. This study addresses the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over magnetic metal-modified HY zeolite catalysts for producing isomerized alkane-type SAF fractions without requiring external hydrogen in an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor. The findings reveal that a lower Si/Al ratio enhances the formation of acid sites on the HY zeolite, which results in increased olefin conversion and produces oil with alkanes' selectivity achieving 60 area%, especially HY12 shows the best performance. The introduction of three magnetic metal oxides (Fe, Co, and Ni) into HY12 changes the acid site distribution with the strong to weak acid site ratio ranging from 0.18 to 0.31. It elevates isomerized alkanes’ selectivity in the aviation fuel range to more than 50 area%. The 6 wt% Fe2O3/HY12 catalyst corresponds to an iso-alkane selectivity of 51.57 area%, a total SAF fraction selectivity of 84.27 area% and an oil yield of 74.33 wt%. Furthermore, this catalyst operates without pre-reduction as the metal oxides can be reduced in situ during pyrolysis, and it also allows for the magnetic recovery of the spent catalyst. Finally, the mechanism for the formation of iso-alkanes and coke deposition onto the catalyst has been proposed. This research provides essential insights for optimizing plastic waste pyrolysis for preparing SAF and tailoring its composition.
