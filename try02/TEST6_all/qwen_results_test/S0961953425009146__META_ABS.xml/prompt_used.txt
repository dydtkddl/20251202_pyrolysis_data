You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on the high-temperature co-pyrolysis of Elm and waste textiles To address the dual challenges of rising energy demand and solid waste valorization, this study conducted high-temperature co-pyrolysis experiments of Elm with Waste Textiles (PET, Cotton) in a vertical furnace and thermogravimetric analyzer. The experiments revealed that co-pyrolysis significantly altered the product distribution and composition, manifested by an increase in gas yield and a decrease in liquid yield. Co-pyrolysis of Elm with both textiles consistently promoted the generation of H2 and CO while simultaneously suppressing CH4 production. Notably, co-pyrolysis with Cotton yielded significantly higher amounts of H2 (31.02 mmol) and CO (43.59 mmol) than co-pyrolysis with PET. Regarding the liquid products, the addition of PET substantially increased the aromatic hydrocarbon content (reaching a maximum of 81.20 %) and significantly inhibited the formation of phenols. Although the addition of Cotton also increased the aromatic content, the extent of this increase was lower than that observed with PET. Thermogravimetric-mass spectrometric (TG-MS) analysis further elucidated that: The Elm-PET mixture exhibited an inhibitory effect during the low-temperature co-pyrolysis stage, characterized by delayed thermal weight loss peaks and increased residual mass, while promoting H2 generation and inhibiting CH4 release; Conversely, the Elm-Cotton mixture, due to overlapping pyrolysis temperature ranges, demonstrated a significant synergistic effect (evidenced by an increased DTG peak height), while also promoting CO release.
