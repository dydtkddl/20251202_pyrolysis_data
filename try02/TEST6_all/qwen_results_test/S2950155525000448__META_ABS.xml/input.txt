Recent Advances in Catalytic Hydroprocessing of Lignin and Plastics for Aromatic Compound Production Lignin and plastics are two of the most extensively used polymeric materials in contemporary industrial systems. As a biomass-derived polymer containing abundant aromatic units, lignin has emerged as a prime candidate for replacing fossil fuels owing to its renewable nature. Paradoxically, as synthetic polymer materials with aromatic structures similar to those of lignin, plastics have become a critical environmental challenge owing to their accumulation over recent decades. The inherent stabilities of lignin and plastics pose significant challenges for their efficient utilization and recycling, making catalytic depolymerization a focal research point in recent years. Innovative catalytic strategies that enable the high-yield production of aromatic compounds through the catalytic hydroprocessing of lignin and plastic waste have recently emerged. These methods offer opportunities for the conversion of recalcitrant polymers into valuable chemicals and sustainable fuels. This paper comprehensively reviews these advancements and emphasizes their potential applications in catalytic hydroprocessing for biofuel production. Additionally, it highlights the latest developments in the high-value upgrading of lignin derivatives and underscores their significance in building a sustainable chemical industry. The review examines the entire value chain from lignin and plastic depolymerization to the production of high-value chemicals to outline the potential for enhancing the efficiency of sustainable processes. This emphasizes the critical role of developing novel cost-effective methodologies for the catalytic depolymerization of lignin and plastic waste. These advancements are expected to play a pivotal role in fostering a sustainable economy and addressing pressing environmental challenges.
