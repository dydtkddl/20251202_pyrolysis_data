You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Persulfate activation by nanodiamond-derived carbon onions: Effect of phase transformation of the inner diamond core on reaction kinetics and mechanisms To investigate the impact of carbon phase conversion on the catalytic activity of nanodiamonds, in this study, we tested nanodiamonds subjected to graphitization at varying temperatures for persulfate activation. Temperatures beyond 1000°C (where only surface graphitization occurs) steadily enhanced the persulfate activation capability as the inner carbon underwent substantial sp3-to-sp2 transformation. Nanodiamonds annealed at 2000°C outperformed benchmark nanocarbons in terms of persulfate activation efficiency. Non-radical activation occurred primarily based on the effects of radical quenchers, oxidation product distribution, substrate-dependent reactivity, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Aligned with the density functional theory calculations of the binding energies of peroxydisulfate on the slab models, built via Bernal stacking of graphitic carbon layers on the diamond plane, isothermal titration calorimetry measurements suggested that the binding affinity of peroxydisulfate decreased as the sp2/sp3 ratio increased. Therefore, the enhancing effect of graphitization arose from the electrical conductivity of nanodiamonds, which increased proportionally with graphitization extent.
