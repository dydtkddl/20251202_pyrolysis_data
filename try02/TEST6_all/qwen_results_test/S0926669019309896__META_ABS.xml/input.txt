Scope of value addition and utilization of residual biomass from medicinal and aromatic plants Agro- and industrial processes that utilises medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) generates various kinds of residues like residual biomasses from distillation of aromatic plant and non-utilized parts of medicinal plant. These residual biomasses cannot be considered as waste as these can actually be recycled and converted into value added products. So, value addition to these residual biomasses through processing, extraction, hydrolysis, pyrolysis and fermentation, etc. could be an exciting avenue especially for the underutilized part of medicinal plant and residual biomass from the distillation of aromatic plant. These biomasses are suitable for isolation of phytochemicals like phenolics-antioxidants which can be used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and perfumery industry. After extraction of phytochemicals, the residual biomass can be used directly as animal feed/or organic mulch. Besides, preparation of value added product, like bio sorbent for waste water purification, composts and biochar for an effective soil amendment. These value added products are found to be more promising. In this article, the potential uses of these residual biomasses as valued products have been discussed including the technology developed at laboratory scale and their application in industry. Effective recycling of residual biomass from MAPs is not only for an economic gain, but also a practical solution for its disposal. Thus, dual utilization of the residual biomasses is of great interest and will open windows of opportunity in MAPs sector.
