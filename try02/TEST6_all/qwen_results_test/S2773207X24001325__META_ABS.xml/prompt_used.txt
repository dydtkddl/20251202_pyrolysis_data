You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable approaches and advancements in the recycling and recovery of metals in batteries: A review Batteries play an integral role in our lives; their presence spans from cars to Mars rovers. Meeting the current demand for batteries involves extracting a significant number of ores. However, it's crucial to note that both the extraction and unsustainable recycling processes are considered high-carbon methods, resulting in the release of substantial CO2 emissions. This presents a significant concern contributing to global climate change. In alignment with this, India has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. To address these environmental challenges, there is a growing need to adopt sustainable methods for battery recycling that effectively minimize the carbon footprint. This review delves into comprehensive discussions, encompassing both conventional and novel methods aimed at reducing the carbon footprint during the recycling of widely used secondary batteries. Additionally, the review explores the extraction of valuable materials such as lithium, nickel, lead, and cadmium from spent batteries. Concurrently, the review investigates the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning, recognizing their substantial roles in precisely predicting battery life and advancing recycling processes. Through engagement with these multifaceted approaches, our aim is to mitigate the environmental impact of batteries while concurrently enhancing their efficiency and sustainability.
