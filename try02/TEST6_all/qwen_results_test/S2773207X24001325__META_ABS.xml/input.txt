Sustainable approaches and advancements in the recycling and recovery of metals in batteries: A review Batteries play an integral role in our lives; their presence spans from cars to Mars rovers. Meeting the current demand for batteries involves extracting a significant number of ores. However, it's crucial to note that both the extraction and unsustainable recycling processes are considered high-carbon methods, resulting in the release of substantial CO2 emissions. This presents a significant concern contributing to global climate change. In alignment with this, India has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. To address these environmental challenges, there is a growing need to adopt sustainable methods for battery recycling that effectively minimize the carbon footprint. This review delves into comprehensive discussions, encompassing both conventional and novel methods aimed at reducing the carbon footprint during the recycling of widely used secondary batteries. Additionally, the review explores the extraction of valuable materials such as lithium, nickel, lead, and cadmium from spent batteries. Concurrently, the review investigates the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning, recognizing their substantial roles in precisely predicting battery life and advancing recycling processes. Through engagement with these multifaceted approaches, our aim is to mitigate the environmental impact of batteries while concurrently enhancing their efficiency and sustainability.
