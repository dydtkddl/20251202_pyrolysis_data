You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on lignin pyrolysis: Mechanism, modeling and the effects of inherent metals in biomass This work comprehensively reviews the pyrolysis of lignin from the aspects of mechanism, modeling, and effects of inorganic species. Initially, the lignin general pyrolysis characteristics are described in detail. The effect of lignin isolation methods on pyrolysis characteristics and product distribution, together with the interactions between the lignin and holocellulose are considered. Then, the depolymerization mechanism of lignin, i.e. homolytic reaction and concerted decomposition, as well as the conversion mechanism of propionic acid side-chain and oxygen-containing functional groups in monomers, aree discussed. Moreover, three main types of zero-dimension models of lignin pyrolysis, viz. lumped kinetic models, network models, and mechanistic models are reviewed with the special attention paid to the structure representation and reaction network. Influences of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals on the lignin pyrolysis are concluded from four aspects, including metal-catalyzed lignin pyrolysis experiments, metal minerals migration and transformation, quantum chemical simulation calculations, and the modeling. Finally, challenges and prospects are discussed in the last section of this article.
