You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impacts of microplastics in municipal sludge pyrolysis-gasification: Melt-induced microaggregation and increased deposition risk The escalating contamination of microplastics (MPs) is progressively introducing new challenges to the management and reutilization of municipal sludge (MS). Pyrolysis-gasification is an important MS disposal process. However, the influence of MPs on the process above remains understudied now. This work aimed to evaluate the characteristics of MPs residue in carbon resulting from medium-low temperature MS pyrolysis and explored their impacts on the gasification reactivity and deposition tendencies of the pyrolytic carbon. The results showed that microplastic residues in MS pyrolytic carbon were tiny and highly resistant to degradation, thereby significantly increasing their biological risks. Base on the analyses on morphological characterization, compound composition, volatile matter release, and carbonaceous structure, residual MPs were demonstrated to form porous "C-organic matter-C″ microaggregates in carbon, and corresponding melt-induced formation mechanisms were clarified. In gasification reactions, carbon defect structures and reactive matters introduced by MPs enhanced the gasification activity at low temperatures. Nevertheless, large aggregated volatile organic components and metals increased slag volume and agglomeration, so resulting in deposition risks. Given the elevated contamination of MPs in pyrolytic carbon, gasification emerges as a reliable strategy for mitigating environmental risks, but may require upgraded technologies (e.g., additive, and new reactor design) to reduce the deposition problem. These findings provide scientific foundation for the management of secondary contamination of microplastics in MS, thereby facilitating an environmentally friendly disposal process.
