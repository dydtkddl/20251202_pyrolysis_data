You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of sawdust and municipal solid waste based on multilamellar MFI nanosheets to obtain hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil In this study, H-type multilamellar MFI nanosheets (HMMN) were used for the catalytic reforming of municipal solid waste (MSW) and sawdust co-pyrolysis products to produce high-value bio-oil. Moreover, the catalytic deoxygenation performance of HMMN was studied. HMMN contains abundant surface area, mesopore volume, and a high ratio of Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites. According to the results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), adding MSW improves the pyrolysis behaviors of sawdust by enhancing the escape of volatile matter. Analyzing the pyrolysis products reveals that a synergistic effect between sawdust and MSW promotes the formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and reduces the relative yield of oxygen-containing compounds (OCCs), which facilitates further catalytic reforming for high-value bio-oil production. When the mass ratio of HMMN to sample is increased from 0% to 120%, the relative yield of MAHs increases from 15.64% to 53.5% (in 25%MSW), implying that HMMN exhibits high selectivity for MAHs. Furthermore, the content of OCCs is significantly reduced, with a maximum reduction of 58.2%. HMMN has a catalytic effect on the deoxygenation and aromatization of long-chain fatty acids and sugars. Relative to HZSM-5(38), HMMN exhibits higher aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity and a more significant inhibitory effect on the OCCs. Ex-situ catalytic reforming under HMMN is confirmed to be a feasible route to obtain hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil.
