You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring the pyrolytic degradation of seventeen phthalate esters using the non-targeted regions of interest-multivariate curve resolution (ROIMCR) chemometric method The global use of phthalate esters (PAEs) in plastic production entails a need for developing effective remediation strategies to minimize exposure and health risks. In this study, pyrolysis degradation processes are evaluated for 17 different PAEs that were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC-Orbitrap-MS) at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C) both in electron ionization (EI) and positive chemical ionization (PCI) mode. All the analytical data generated have been processed with the Regions of Interest Multivariate Curve Resolution (ROIMCR) chemometrics method. A preliminary selection of the Mass Spectrometry Regions of Interest (ROIs) coupled to a bilinear factor decomposition method (MCR-ALS) allowed the identification of 4 principal components, which were used to define the thermal degradation process. ROIMCR method is a powerful tool for non-targeted analysis which allows the resolution of the elution and spectral profiles of the different constituents present in the analyzed samples, which were confirmed using PCI. Moreover, ROIMCR was used to resolve and identify the different products generated during the studied degradation processes. As a result, 10 new thermal degradation products were identified in the analysis of the different sample sets. Finally, the degradation efficiencies higher than 99.8 % were obtained for all the PAEs at 800 °C, except for benzoic acid-benzyl ester, whose removal efficiency decreased to 94.8 %. As phthalates are widespread and toxic compounds for the environment and for humans, there is a need for new remediation technologies. This study provides new knowledge to understand their elimination through thermal processes. We combine mass spectrometric data with powerful chemometric processing to determine the removal efficiency, to understand the degradation process and to identify the degradation compounds formed through thermal decomposition.
