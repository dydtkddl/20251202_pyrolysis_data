You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An overview of non-biodegradable bioplastics Bioplastics have introduced numerous flexibilities to humankind. However, bioplastics have brought newer challenges in waste management. Approximately half of the current bioplastic market is not biodegradable, and with a larger market volume, its end-of-life allocation will be problematic for the governments and policymakers. This study aims to provide an overview of the non-biodegradable bioplastics market, including their underlined challenges, typical production methods, characterization, and possible alternative waste utilization perspective. Bioplastic production usually starts from a biological source i.e., biomass and a series of modification techniques such as pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation are carried out to produce bioethanol. Then, bioethanol is converted to non-biodegradable bioplastics. The major non-biodegradable bioplastics are bio-polyethylene (bio-PE), bio-polypropylene (bio-PP), bio-polyethylene-terephthalate (bio-PET), bio-polytrimethylene terephthalate (Bio-PTT), and bio-polyamide (bio-PA). In this review article, an overview of each bioplastic is presented with flow diagrams. Also, the production method of compostable bioplastics—polylactic acid (PLA) — is briefly discussed for comparison purpose. Since the chemical structure of bio-based non-biodegradable plastics is similar to the conventional fossil-based plastics, the characterization and alternative thermochemical utilization techniques of five bioplastic wastes are discussed based on the conventional plastics characterizations. Per ultimate analysis, considering high hydrogen, low oxygen, and low fixed carbon content, bio-PE and bio-PP are recommended as potential feedstocks for the catalytic pyrolysis process to produce gasoline and diesel range liquid hydrocarbons. Alternatively, bio-PET, bio-PA, and PLA are recommended as potential feedstocks for the gasification process, considering their higher oxygen content.
