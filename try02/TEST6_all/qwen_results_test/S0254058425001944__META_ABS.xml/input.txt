Polystyrene waste-derived ion-exchange resins for water desalination The use of waste expanded polystyrene as a viable source of replacement material for production of both strong acid cation exchange (SAC) and strong base anion exchange (SBA) resins to achieve produced water desalination has been proposed in this study. The material was created in multistep process and functionalized using plasma and chemical treatments. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies were carried out to characterize the obtained material. The optimum parameters that contribute to the most efficient ion removal have been identified, including preconditioning and regeneration procedures. Activation of the resins can be achieved by simple swelling in water prior to testing, while regeneration can be performed using 5 M H2SO4 and 3 M NaOH solutions for SAC and SBA resins respectively. Batch and column tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of these resins in removing common ions in produced water – Na+, Ca2+, SO4 2− and Cl−. It was discovered that a pseudo-second order equation could adequately characterize the sorption kinetics of the resins. The equilibrium capacities were determined to be 0.4 eq/L (Na+ form) for SAC resin and 0.015 eq/L (SO4 2− form) for SBA resin. When stored in air, the resins' performance remains consistent at least for one month. The dynamical column testing shows higher performance of developed resins compared to the commercial one. It was found that both SAC and SBA show no selectivity on test solutions containing several types of mono- and divalent ions. The development of these sustainable ion exchange resins has enormous potential for produced water treatment, besides offering a practical and environmentally friendly solution for effective recycling of the plastic waste.
