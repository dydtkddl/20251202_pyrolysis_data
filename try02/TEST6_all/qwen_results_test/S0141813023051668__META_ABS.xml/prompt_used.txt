You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether modified chitosan/nano-SiO2 via hydrothermal process: A statistical modeling and adsorption mechanism for reactive orange 16 dye removal In this study, chitosan/nano SiO2 (CTS/NS) was chemically modified with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) cross-linker-assisted hydrothermal process to create an effective adsorbent, CTS-BADGE/NS, for the removal of reactive orange 16 (RO16) dye from aquatic systems. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to optimize the adsorption process by varying the adsorbent dose (0.02–0.1 g/100 mL), pH (4–10), and time (20–360 min). The adsorption isotherm results indicated that the Langmuir model fits the experimental data well, suggesting that the adsorption process involves a monolayer formation of RO16 on the surface of CTS-BADGE/NS. The kinetic modeling of RO16 adsorption by CTS-BADGE/NS demonstrated that the pseudo-first-order model fits the adsorption data. CTS-BADGE/NS achieved an adsorption capacity of 97.8 mg/g for RO16 dye at optimum desirability functions of dosage 0.099 g/100 mL, solution pH of 4.44, and temperature of 25 °C. Overall, the π-π electron donor-acceptor system significantly improved the adsorption performance of the CTS-BADGE/NS. The results of the regeneration investigation demonstrate that the CTS-BADGE/NS exhibits effective adsorption of RO16, even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. The results of this study suggest that the developed CTS-BADGE/NS composite can be a promising adsorbent for water purification applications.
