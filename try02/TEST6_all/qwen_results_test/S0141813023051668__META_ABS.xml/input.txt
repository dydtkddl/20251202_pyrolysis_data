Bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether modified chitosan/nano-SiO2 via hydrothermal process: A statistical modeling and adsorption mechanism for reactive orange 16 dye removal In this study, chitosan/nano SiO2 (CTS/NS) was chemically modified with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) cross-linker-assisted hydrothermal process to create an effective adsorbent, CTS-BADGE/NS, for the removal of reactive orange 16 (RO16) dye from aquatic systems. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to optimize the adsorption process by varying the adsorbent dose (0.02–0.1 g/100 mL), pH (4–10), and time (20–360 min). The adsorption isotherm results indicated that the Langmuir model fits the experimental data well, suggesting that the adsorption process involves a monolayer formation of RO16 on the surface of CTS-BADGE/NS. The kinetic modeling of RO16 adsorption by CTS-BADGE/NS demonstrated that the pseudo-first-order model fits the adsorption data. CTS-BADGE/NS achieved an adsorption capacity of 97.8 mg/g for RO16 dye at optimum desirability functions of dosage 0.099 g/100 mL, solution pH of 4.44, and temperature of 25 °C. Overall, the π-π electron donor-acceptor system significantly improved the adsorption performance of the CTS-BADGE/NS. The results of the regeneration investigation demonstrate that the CTS-BADGE/NS exhibits effective adsorption of RO16, even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. The results of this study suggest that the developed CTS-BADGE/NS composite can be a promising adsorbent for water purification applications.
