You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-production of H2 and CNTs from coal gangue-supported co-pyrolysis of PP/PE/PVC mixture in a two-stage reactor As a persistent environmental pollutant, the management of waste plastics is critical for mitigating soil and water contamination. In the quest for carbon neutrality, this study presents a sustainable approach to waste plastic valorization through catalytic pyrolysis, focusing on hydrogen(H2) production and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synthesis. A coal gangue-based catalyst was utilized in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor for the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to evaluate the co-production efficiency. H2 was yielded by PP and PE at 63.9 vol% and 66.5 vol%, respectively, with PP yielding 6.23 wt% more CNTs than PE. Co-pyrolysis of PP and PE increased H2 concentration by 11.23 vol% and 7.71 vol% over individual pyrolysis, and yields of CNTs by 11.99 wt% and 17.15 wt%, respectively. These results highlight the superiority of mixed pyrolysis over individual processes for H2 concentration and CNTs production. The pyrolysis of PVC, which releases a significant amount of HCl, deactivates a coal gangue-based catalyst that is rich in Fe2O3 and inhibits the growth of CNTs by disrupting the Fe2O3 structure and bonding with carbon. To harness chlorine-containing plastics for CNTs production, the pyrolytic catalytic process must be optimized to mitigate chlorine's detrimental effects. There are valuable insights provided by this research into the thermochemical treatment of waste plastics, contributing to the clean production of H2 and CNTs, aligning with carbon neutrality objectives by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable waste management strategies.
