You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design, CFD simulation, and experimental verification of a novel fixed-bed decoupling gasifier with an integrated syngas burner using high-temperature flue gas This study evaluated the performance of a decoupling gasifier with an integrated syngas burner using experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. For temperature validation, the errors in the temperatures of the combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and drying zones as predicted by the model compared to the experiment were approximately 1.74 %, 0.61 %, 2.31 %, and 16.35 %, respectively. For syngas composition, the differences between model and experimental values for the CO2, H2, CH4, and CO concentrations were 5.01 %, 8.78 %, 1.76 %, and 3.83 %, respectively. The contours and vector directions of the syngas were accurately simulated using a gasification model. The gasification performances of the decoupling gasifier during steady-state conditions were lower heating value = 8.49 MJ/N·m3 (nitrogen-free), cold gas efficiency = 46.07 %, H2/CO = 0.24, and CO/CO2 = 1.58. In terms of emissions, the total suspended particulates were 84.8 mg/Nm3, CO2 was 5.78 % by volume, and CO was 196 ppm. The exhaust flame in the flue gas burner was stable and may be used in thermal applications. The developed model was capable of predicting the reactor temperature, syngas composition, and gasification performances for various reactor aspect ratios. In summary, a decoupling gasifier with an integrated syngas burner could serve as a viable and clean conversion technology.
