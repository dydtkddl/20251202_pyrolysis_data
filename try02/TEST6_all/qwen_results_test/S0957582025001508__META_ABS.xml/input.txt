Design, CFD simulation, and experimental verification of a novel fixed-bed decoupling gasifier with an integrated syngas burner using high-temperature flue gas This study evaluated the performance of a decoupling gasifier with an integrated syngas burner using experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. For temperature validation, the errors in the temperatures of the combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and drying zones as predicted by the model compared to the experiment were approximately 1.74 %, 0.61 %, 2.31 %, and 16.35 %, respectively. For syngas composition, the differences between model and experimental values for the CO2, H2, CH4, and CO concentrations were 5.01 %, 8.78 %, 1.76 %, and 3.83 %, respectively. The contours and vector directions of the syngas were accurately simulated using a gasification model. The gasification performances of the decoupling gasifier during steady-state conditions were lower heating value = 8.49 MJ/N·m3 (nitrogen-free), cold gas efficiency = 46.07 %, H2/CO = 0.24, and CO/CO2 = 1.58. In terms of emissions, the total suspended particulates were 84.8 mg/Nm3, CO2 was 5.78 % by volume, and CO was 196 ppm. The exhaust flame in the flue gas burner was stable and may be used in thermal applications. The developed model was capable of predicting the reactor temperature, syngas composition, and gasification performances for various reactor aspect ratios. In summary, a decoupling gasifier with an integrated syngas burner could serve as a viable and clean conversion technology.
