Bio-oil production and catalytic upgrade to value added product: A review on recent technologies The urgent need of an alternative to fossil fuel has increased the attention towards renewable sources of fuel significantly. Organic matter which are produced through photosynthesis are termed as biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass can be greatly exploited as source of renewable energy, chemicals and materials. Thermochemical conversion like pyrolysis or gasification of lignocellulose biomass produce biogas or bio-oil which needs to be upgraded to transportation fuel. But several undesirable qualities like high viscosity, instability, low energy density, polymerization and corrosion are associated with bio-oil produced from lignocellulosic biomass due to their high oxygen content. Several techniques are available to upgrade the bio-oil which omits the undesirable qualities. The direct relationship between different characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass and quality of bio-oil along with different technologies for bio-oil production are discussed in this review. This review also emphasizes on several upgradation techniques along with the catalysts. The technoeconomic analysis discusses the economic potential of bio-oil and concentrate on the cost-effectivity. Finally, the challenges and future research directions are further analysed in this review.
