You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-oil production and catalytic upgrade to value added product: A review on recent technologies The urgent need of an alternative to fossil fuel has increased the attention towards renewable sources of fuel significantly. Organic matter which are produced through photosynthesis are termed as biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass can be greatly exploited as source of renewable energy, chemicals and materials. Thermochemical conversion like pyrolysis or gasification of lignocellulose biomass produce biogas or bio-oil which needs to be upgraded to transportation fuel. But several undesirable qualities like high viscosity, instability, low energy density, polymerization and corrosion are associated with bio-oil produced from lignocellulosic biomass due to their high oxygen content. Several techniques are available to upgrade the bio-oil which omits the undesirable qualities. The direct relationship between different characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass and quality of bio-oil along with different technologies for bio-oil production are discussed in this review. This review also emphasizes on several upgradation techniques along with the catalysts. The technoeconomic analysis discusses the economic potential of bio-oil and concentrate on the cost-effectivity. Finally, the challenges and future research directions are further analysed in this review.
