You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-depolymerization of lignin and plastic waste using hydrothermal liquefaction process Sustainable valorization of underutilized lignin and plastic waste beyond incineration is critical for producing renewable fuels. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) provides a promising approach to convert wet lignin and plastics into high-quality oils without the need for prior drying of wet lignin. This study examines the effects of temperature (300–400 °C), residence time, and polymer molecular weight on product yield and composition during HTL of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and lignin under subcritical and supercritical water conditions. For PE, oil yields increased with temperature, with low molecular weight (LMW) PE achieving a maximum of ∼93 % at 400 °C for 30 min, while high molecular weight (HMW) PE reached ∼86 % at 400 °C for 1 h. Lignin and PP exhibited optimal oil yields at intermediate temperatures, decreasing at higher temperatures due to secondary reactions and char formation. Lignin yielded a maximum of ∼22 % oil at 300 °C for 30 min, LMW PP ∼88 % at 375 °C for 1 h, and HMW PP ∼83 % at 400 °C for 1 h. GC–MS analysis revealed that lignin oils were rich in phenols and alkylphenols, while PE and PP oils were dominated by paraffins and olefins. Oxygenated compounds in PE decreased at higher temperatures, improving oil quality. Co-liquefaction of lignin with plastics enhanced oil yields and energy content under specific conditions, demonstrating synergistic effects dependent on plastic type, molecular weight, and HTL conditions. These findings highlight the potential of HTL to produce high-energy, value-added fuels from lignin–plastic mixtures.
