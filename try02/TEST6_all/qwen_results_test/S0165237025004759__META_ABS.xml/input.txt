Co-depolymerization of lignin and plastic waste using hydrothermal liquefaction process Sustainable valorization of underutilized lignin and plastic waste beyond incineration is critical for producing renewable fuels. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) provides a promising approach to convert wet lignin and plastics into high-quality oils without the need for prior drying of wet lignin. This study examines the effects of temperature (300–400 °C), residence time, and polymer molecular weight on product yield and composition during HTL of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and lignin under subcritical and supercritical water conditions. For PE, oil yields increased with temperature, with low molecular weight (LMW) PE achieving a maximum of ∼93 % at 400 °C for 30 min, while high molecular weight (HMW) PE reached ∼86 % at 400 °C for 1 h. Lignin and PP exhibited optimal oil yields at intermediate temperatures, decreasing at higher temperatures due to secondary reactions and char formation. Lignin yielded a maximum of ∼22 % oil at 300 °C for 30 min, LMW PP ∼88 % at 375 °C for 1 h, and HMW PP ∼83 % at 400 °C for 1 h. GC–MS analysis revealed that lignin oils were rich in phenols and alkylphenols, while PE and PP oils were dominated by paraffins and olefins. Oxygenated compounds in PE decreased at higher temperatures, improving oil quality. Co-liquefaction of lignin with plastics enhanced oil yields and energy content under specific conditions, demonstrating synergistic effects dependent on plastic type, molecular weight, and HTL conditions. These findings highlight the potential of HTL to produce high-energy, value-added fuels from lignin–plastic mixtures.
