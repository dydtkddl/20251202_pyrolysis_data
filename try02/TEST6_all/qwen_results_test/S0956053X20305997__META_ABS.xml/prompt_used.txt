You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect, kinetic and thermodynamics parameters analyses of co-gasification of municipal solid waste and bituminous coal with CO2 Co-gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) with bituminous coal (BC) is an attractive alternative to realize the harmless disposal and energy harvesting of MSW. In this work, co-gasification characteristics and synergistic interaction of MSW and BC with CO2 atmosphere are studied by thermogravimetric method, including analyses of thermodynamics, kinetic parameters and reaction mechanism function. Results indicate that MSW gasification process can be divided into four main stages, and that of BC has only three main stages. Gasification temperature of coal char is much higher than that of MSW char, and addition of MSW can significantly improve the gasification reactivity of BC. Besides, a significant synergistic effect is observed for all the blends in char gasification stage. Based on three kinetic methods of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (Xie et al., 2018), Starink (Zhang et al., 2019a) and Friedman, the minimum average activation energy E a (184.13 kJ/mol) is obtained when the blend ratio of BC is 40% which might be an optimal option for co-gasification of the blends. The average values of the enthalpy, the Gibbs function and the entropy changes for sample 60MSW40BC are 176.82 kJ/mol, 257.89 kJ/mol and −89.16 J/mol·K, respectively. According to the Malek method, F6, A1 and D7 models are probably more suitable to describe three main stages of sample 60MSW40BC CO2 co-gasification.
