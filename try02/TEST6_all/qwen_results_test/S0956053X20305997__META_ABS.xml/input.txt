Synergistic effect, kinetic and thermodynamics parameters analyses of co-gasification of municipal solid waste and bituminous coal with CO2 Co-gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) with bituminous coal (BC) is an attractive alternative to realize the harmless disposal and energy harvesting of MSW. In this work, co-gasification characteristics and synergistic interaction of MSW and BC with CO2 atmosphere are studied by thermogravimetric method, including analyses of thermodynamics, kinetic parameters and reaction mechanism function. Results indicate that MSW gasification process can be divided into four main stages, and that of BC has only three main stages. Gasification temperature of coal char is much higher than that of MSW char, and addition of MSW can significantly improve the gasification reactivity of BC. Besides, a significant synergistic effect is observed for all the blends in char gasification stage. Based on three kinetic methods of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (Xie et al., 2018), Starink (Zhang et al., 2019a) and Friedman, the minimum average activation energy E a (184.13 kJ/mol) is obtained when the blend ratio of BC is 40% which might be an optimal option for co-gasification of the blends. The average values of the enthalpy, the Gibbs function and the entropy changes for sample 60MSW40BC are 176.82 kJ/mol, 257.89 kJ/mol and −89.16 J/mol·K, respectively. According to the Malek method, F6, A1 and D7 models are probably more suitable to describe three main stages of sample 60MSW40BC CO2 co-gasification.
