You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis, risk assessment and treatment of aquatic micro/nanoplastics: A critical review Aquatic micro/nanoplastics (M/NPs) as a global environmental pollutant, energetically prefers to the adsorption of heavy metals and organic matter in water, which is a serious threat to the ecological environment and people’s health. At present, compared with hot research of M/NPs source, migration, transformation, reorientation and ecotoxicological effect, analysis and treatment of M/NPs in water environments is still in early stages. In this work, this review summarizes a panorama of the state-of-the-art progress related to the aquatic M/NPs analysis, including water collection, sample pretreatment and M/NPs identification. The construction and characteristics of each identification methods could be introduced, namely optical or electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This is followed by a consideration of the risk assessment for aquatic M/NPs by employing different indicators. Apart from that, the review has clear clarification of M/NPs treatment methods based on its mechanism, such as coagulating sedimentation, filtering, adsorption, advanced oxidation process, disinfection process, traditional activated sludge process, membrane bioreactor and constructed wetland method. The removal performance, influence factors, limitations and future development directions of these treatment processes for M/NPs are also discussed and summarized. Last but not least, future opportunities and challenges for aquatic M/NPs analysis and treatment are presented. This review can not only serve as a scientific guidance to promote the progress of techniques and accelerate its large-scale application, but also provide new insights toward future research.
