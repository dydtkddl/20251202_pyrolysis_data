Analysis, risk assessment and treatment of aquatic micro/nanoplastics: A critical review Aquatic micro/nanoplastics (M/NPs) as a global environmental pollutant, energetically prefers to the adsorption of heavy metals and organic matter in water, which is a serious threat to the ecological environment and people’s health. At present, compared with hot research of M/NPs source, migration, transformation, reorientation and ecotoxicological effect, analysis and treatment of M/NPs in water environments is still in early stages. In this work, this review summarizes a panorama of the state-of-the-art progress related to the aquatic M/NPs analysis, including water collection, sample pretreatment and M/NPs identification. The construction and characteristics of each identification methods could be introduced, namely optical or electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This is followed by a consideration of the risk assessment for aquatic M/NPs by employing different indicators. Apart from that, the review has clear clarification of M/NPs treatment methods based on its mechanism, such as coagulating sedimentation, filtering, adsorption, advanced oxidation process, disinfection process, traditional activated sludge process, membrane bioreactor and constructed wetland method. The removal performance, influence factors, limitations and future development directions of these treatment processes for M/NPs are also discussed and summarized. Last but not least, future opportunities and challenges for aquatic M/NPs analysis and treatment are presented. This review can not only serve as a scientific guidance to promote the progress of techniques and accelerate its large-scale application, but also provide new insights toward future research.
