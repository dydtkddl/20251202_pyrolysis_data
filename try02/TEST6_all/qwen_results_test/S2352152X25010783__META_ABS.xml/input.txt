Recent developments in metal-organic framework-derived transition metal oxide@carbon nanostructure and carbon nanostructure for supercapacitor applications Supercapacitors require electrode materials with high capacitance, surface area, and controlled pore architecture to achieve optimal energy storage performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), due to their customizable pore sizes, high surface areas, and versatile dimensional structures, are emerging as promising precursors for advanced electrode materials. However, pristine MOFs often suffer from low electrical conductivity and limited cycle stability, which restrict their practical utility. In this review, we explore the synthesis of MOF-derived carbon and metal oxide composites, focusing on the effect of various parameters—such as temperature, metal composition, organic linker type, and heating rate—on the conversion to high-performance electrode materials. We also compare the electrochemical performance of MOF-derived composites with traditional metal oxides, revealing insights into charge storage mechanisms across different types of supercapacitors (symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid configurations) and different types of electrolytes used in supercapacitors. This discussion includes a critical assessment of the advantages of MOF-derived composites and identifies its future research directions to overcome the existing limitations in scalability and durability.
