You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments in metal-organic framework-derived transition metal oxide@carbon nanostructure and carbon nanostructure for supercapacitor applications Supercapacitors require electrode materials with high capacitance, surface area, and controlled pore architecture to achieve optimal energy storage performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), due to their customizable pore sizes, high surface areas, and versatile dimensional structures, are emerging as promising precursors for advanced electrode materials. However, pristine MOFs often suffer from low electrical conductivity and limited cycle stability, which restrict their practical utility. In this review, we explore the synthesis of MOF-derived carbon and metal oxide composites, focusing on the effect of various parameters—such as temperature, metal composition, organic linker type, and heating rate—on the conversion to high-performance electrode materials. We also compare the electrochemical performance of MOF-derived composites with traditional metal oxides, revealing insights into charge storage mechanisms across different types of supercapacitors (symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid configurations) and different types of electrolytes used in supercapacitors. This discussion includes a critical assessment of the advantages of MOF-derived composites and identifies its future research directions to overcome the existing limitations in scalability and durability.
