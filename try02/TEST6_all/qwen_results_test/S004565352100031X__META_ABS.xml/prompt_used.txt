You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Magnetic bio-activated carbons production using different process parameters for phosphorus removal from artificially prepared phosphorus-rich and domestic wastewater A series of magnetic bio-activated carbon (MBAC) has been produced from lignin and ferrous salts following to the process including impregnation, carbonization, and steam activation. The influence of the impregnation methods and the steam flow rate on the quality and the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of the produced MBACs has been investigated. The phosphorus adsorption performance in real domestic wastewater of the MBAC with the highest maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity has been investigated. The results show that all of the produced MBACs have a relatively rich porous structure, and all surface iron species exist as magnetite (Fe3O4). Compared with the MBACs that are produced via the dry impregnation method using a lower steam flow rate, the MBACs that are produced via the wet impregnation method using a higher steam flow rate are believed to have a higher iron content and better iron species dispersion. The highest maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of all the produced MBACs is estimated to be as high as 69.80 mg-P/g according to the best-fitting Langmuir model. The MBAC that shows the highest maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity could also remove 84.65% and 96.97% of the total phosphorus from the filtered raw domestic wastewater (FRDW) and treated domestic wastewater (TDW), respectively, which indicates a good potential for using MBACs for domestic wastewater treatment.
