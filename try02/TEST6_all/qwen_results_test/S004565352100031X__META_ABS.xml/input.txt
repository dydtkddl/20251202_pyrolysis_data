Magnetic bio-activated carbons production using different process parameters for phosphorus removal from artificially prepared phosphorus-rich and domestic wastewater A series of magnetic bio-activated carbon (MBAC) has been produced from lignin and ferrous salts following to the process including impregnation, carbonization, and steam activation. The influence of the impregnation methods and the steam flow rate on the quality and the maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of the produced MBACs has been investigated. The phosphorus adsorption performance in real domestic wastewater of the MBAC with the highest maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity has been investigated. The results show that all of the produced MBACs have a relatively rich porous structure, and all surface iron species exist as magnetite (Fe3O4). Compared with the MBACs that are produced via the dry impregnation method using a lower steam flow rate, the MBACs that are produced via the wet impregnation method using a higher steam flow rate are believed to have a higher iron content and better iron species dispersion. The highest maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of all the produced MBACs is estimated to be as high as 69.80 mg-P/g according to the best-fitting Langmuir model. The MBAC that shows the highest maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity could also remove 84.65% and 96.97% of the total phosphorus from the filtered raw domestic wastewater (FRDW) and treated domestic wastewater (TDW), respectively, which indicates a good potential for using MBACs for domestic wastewater treatment.
