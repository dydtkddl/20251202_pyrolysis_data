You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling multiphase composite wastes into lactic acid with full recovery of polyethylene and aluminum Multiphase composite wastes (MCWs) are an important class of recyclable materials composed of tightly bonded hierarchical polymer-metal-cellulose architectures. Upcycling of MCWs (e.g., Tetra Pak) is hindered by their intricately layered architectures, which impose compromised material integrity and mechanical performance, and poor economy. Herein we report a solvent-based upcycling route for Tetra Pak packaging that enables high-value utilization of all components. Guided by molecular dynamics simulations, which identified water as the optimal medium for cellulose solvation, catalytic liquefaction of the paper fraction in subcritical water with Er(OTf)3 at 240 °C achieved a 75 wt% liquid product yield with 77 % selectivity to lactic acid. Subsequent toluene extraction, selected via Hansen solubility parameters, afforded near-quantitative recovery of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and aluminum from the residue. The recovered LDPE demonstrated virgin-grade thermal stability, rheological properties, and integrity, as evidenced by TGA, rheometry, and pyrolysis results, while high-purity aluminum was also reclaimed. Economic analysis confirms the route's viability as a cost-competitive alternative to sugar-based lactic acid production, offering a promising strategy toward a circular economy for Tetra Pak wastes.
