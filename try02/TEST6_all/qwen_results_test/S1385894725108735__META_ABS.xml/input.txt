Upcycling multiphase composite wastes into lactic acid with full recovery of polyethylene and aluminum Multiphase composite wastes (MCWs) are an important class of recyclable materials composed of tightly bonded hierarchical polymer-metal-cellulose architectures. Upcycling of MCWs (e.g., Tetra Pak) is hindered by their intricately layered architectures, which impose compromised material integrity and mechanical performance, and poor economy. Herein we report a solvent-based upcycling route for Tetra Pak packaging that enables high-value utilization of all components. Guided by molecular dynamics simulations, which identified water as the optimal medium for cellulose solvation, catalytic liquefaction of the paper fraction in subcritical water with Er(OTf)3 at 240 °C achieved a 75 wt% liquid product yield with 77 % selectivity to lactic acid. Subsequent toluene extraction, selected via Hansen solubility parameters, afforded near-quantitative recovery of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and aluminum from the residue. The recovered LDPE demonstrated virgin-grade thermal stability, rheological properties, and integrity, as evidenced by TGA, rheometry, and pyrolysis results, while high-purity aluminum was also reclaimed. Economic analysis confirms the route's viability as a cost-competitive alternative to sugar-based lactic acid production, offering a promising strategy toward a circular economy for Tetra Pak wastes.
