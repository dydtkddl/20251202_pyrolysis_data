You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Heating strategies for the system of PP and Spherical Activated Carbon during microwave cracking for obtaining value-added products Microwave catalytic cracking of waste plastics is a promising technology. However, how to mix effectively microwave absorber, catalyst and feedstock, and reuse microwave absorbers and catalysts is obviously a challenge. This study has focused on the heat transfer performance and reuse of microwave absorber and the influence of heating strategies on cracked products. Commercial Spherical Activated Carbon (SAC), containing some catalysts, has been used for microwave cracking of polypropylene. The effect of heating strategies on product distribution has been studied. Meanwhile, SAC has been reused many times to test the possibility of industrialization of the system. The results show that the heating strategies such as reducing the input power, choosing appropriate intermittent heating time and co-cracking of PP-Wax are beneficial to the formation of light oil. Compared with the first use, the subsequent heating rate of SAC will decrease, but the average heating rate shows a certain stability in the subsequent multiple use (the change range <1 °C/min at 32% input power). From the point of view of heat transfer and reuse, SAC has obvious advantages as microwave absorber. However, the catalytic performance is not significant and needs to be improved in the next study.
