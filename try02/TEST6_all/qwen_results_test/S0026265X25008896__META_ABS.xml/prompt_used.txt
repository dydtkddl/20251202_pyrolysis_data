You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in dopamine electrochemical sensors: Properties and application prospects of different modified materials Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role as a catecholamine neurotransmitter in the human body, and various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and depression are associated with its abnormalities. Therefore, DA detection research has gained more and more interest, and electrochemical sensing has shown to be a reliable, affordable, quick, and simple method for DA trace amount detection. We review and summarize the current development and application prospects of DA electrochemical sensors in the past five years, mainly focusing on the application of various modified materials, including metal/metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials, graphene and its derivatives, metal/covalent-organic frameworks (MOFs/COFs), and nucleic acid aptamers. These materials significantly enhance sensor sensitivity and selectivity through improved conductivity, catalytic activity, specific surface area, and electrode specificity. In addition, the current popular materials and methods are discussed, and the application development of dopamine sensors is summarized. Moreover, strategies for achieving clinical and industrial applications have been discussed. The nucleic acid aptamer-based sensors exhibited extremely low detection limits (1 aM or 10−18 M), demonstrating the excellent performance of aptamer sensors for DA detection. These studies not only provide effective technical means for DA detection, but also offer new possibilities for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of neurological diseases.
