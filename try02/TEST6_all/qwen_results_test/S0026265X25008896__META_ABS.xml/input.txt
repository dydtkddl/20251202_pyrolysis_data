Advances in dopamine electrochemical sensors: Properties and application prospects of different modified materials Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role as a catecholamine neurotransmitter in the human body, and various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and depression are associated with its abnormalities. Therefore, DA detection research has gained more and more interest, and electrochemical sensing has shown to be a reliable, affordable, quick, and simple method for DA trace amount detection. We review and summarize the current development and application prospects of DA electrochemical sensors in the past five years, mainly focusing on the application of various modified materials, including metal/metal oxides, carbon nanomaterials, graphene and its derivatives, metal/covalent-organic frameworks (MOFs/COFs), and nucleic acid aptamers. These materials significantly enhance sensor sensitivity and selectivity through improved conductivity, catalytic activity, specific surface area, and electrode specificity. In addition, the current popular materials and methods are discussed, and the application development of dopamine sensors is summarized. Moreover, strategies for achieving clinical and industrial applications have been discussed. The nucleic acid aptamer-based sensors exhibited extremely low detection limits (1 aM or 10−18 M), demonstrating the excellent performance of aptamer sensors for DA detection. These studies not only provide effective technical means for DA detection, but also offer new possibilities for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of neurological diseases.
