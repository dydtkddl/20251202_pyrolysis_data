A comprehensive review on biochar catalyst for advancement of pyrolytic conversion of biomass into valuable biofuels Background Deriving biofuels and energy from sustainable biomass sources is critical for addressing global energy challenges. Biochar, a by-product of biomass conversion processes, has gained considerable attention due to its abundance, cost-effectiveness, and versatility across various sectors, including environmental remediation, agriculture, materials science, and energy production. Despite extensive research on the use of biochar as a catalyst in environmental applications, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding its potential as a catalyst in pyrolysis processes. Methods However, the surface chemistry, mineral content, and other intrinsic properties of biochar make it highly suitable for use as a carbon-based catalyst and catalyst support. In addition, there has been little focus on investigating the catalytic function of biochar in improving the production and quality of important byproducts, such as bio-oil, syngas, and extra biochar, during pyrolysis of biomass. Significant findings This study aims to present a thorough and detailed scientific information on biochar-based catalysts used for the pyrolytic conversion of biomass into useful biofuels. Through a comprehensive analysis of the production mechanism, catalyst process, synthesizing methods, biochar catalyst properties, and its applications, objective is to provide guidelines for development of application-oriented biochar catalysts and catalyst supports that can enhance biofuel technologies.
