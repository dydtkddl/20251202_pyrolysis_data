You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High temperature induced abundant closed nanopores for hard carbon as high-performance sodium-ion batteries anodes Hard carbon (HC) stands out as the preeminent anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) which are deployed in expansive energy storage infrastructures. Herein, the large enough graphene nanosheets interlayer and abundant nanopores with a diameter of ∼2.1 nm induced by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature in the thermosetting phenolic resin-derived hard carbon matrix to augment the performance of the sodium ion storage. The presence of sufficiently large carbon interlayers has been proven to provide active sites for reversible adsorption, enabling effective storage of sodium ions in the high-voltage slope region, while also promoting rapid Na+ transport. Meanwhile, forming abundant closed nanopores with larger sizes helps sodium ion storage in the low-voltage plateau region. In the optimized samples, the formation of sufficient long graphene nanosheets with a perfect crystal lattice, which further shrinks to form enclosed nanopores, effectively reduces defective sites and specific surface area. Additionally, the appropriate content of C-O and C=O functional groups contributes to an exceptional initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of up to 93%. Simultaneously, the optimized sample HC-1500 contributes to a remarkable plateau capacity of 294 mAh g- 1 during the charging process (high reversible capacity of 403 mAh g- 1 at 0.1 C). Moreover, based on the microstructure evolution and Na storage behavior of hard carbon, an “adsorption (27%) – filling (73%)” sodium storage mechanism that the sodium storage as a quasi-metallic sodium state is demonstrated. Consequently, this study will offer valuable insights for the development of hard carbon anodes tailored for high-energy practical SIBs, while also advancing the understanding of sodium storage mechanisms.
