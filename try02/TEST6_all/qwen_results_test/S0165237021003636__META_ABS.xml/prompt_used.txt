You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Secondary reactions in the analysis of microplastics by analytical pyrolysis Mixtures of plastic particles of different types were analysed by Py-GC-MS in order to investigate the effect of polymer interactions on the composition of pyrolysates. Pyrolysis products associated to secondary reactions were observed when particles of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) were pyrolysed in the presence of poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) and the polyamides PA6 (polycaproamide) and PA66 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide)). Co-pyrolysis of PET in the presence of PVC particles produced mono and dichloroethyl esters of terephthalic acid due to the addition of HCl to the double bond of the vinyl group. Benzyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, 4-chlorobenzoic acid were also tentatively identified. The interaction between PET and PA6 and above all PA66 brought about the formation of aromatic nitriles including methyl and ethyl benzonitrile, 1,4-benzenedicarbonitrile, 4-cyanoethyl benzoate, 4-cyano benzoic acid. In addition, co-pyrolysis of PET and PA66 particles produced N-alkyl amides of benzoic acid. Pyrolysis of benzoic acid generated benzene and diphenyl, while N-hexylbenzamide was observed from the pyrolysis of benzoic acid with hexyl-1-amine or hexan-1,6-diamine. PE (polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PS (polystyrene) and PVC did not exhibit significant interactions. Calibration curves built up with single plastic types in the 10–120 µg range were used to quantify each polymer in the mixture using typical pyrolytic markers. The highest deviations of recovery and the lowest RSD were observed for PET and PA6, while polyolefins produced satisfactory recovery and RSD. The detection of pyrolysis products from secondary reactions can be used as markers for the co-presence of different polymers supporting their identification.
