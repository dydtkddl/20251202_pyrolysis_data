You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Turquoise hydrogen and carbon materials production from thermal methane cracking: An experimental and kinetic modelling study with focus on carbon product morphology Methane (CH4) cracking is emerging as a bridge technology for hydrogen (H2) production fostering the transition from current carbon-intensive production processes (e.g. steam reforming) to the fixation of the carbon content of the feedstock in the form of valuable carbon materials. With the valorization of the carbon product being a key factor to lower H2 prices by improving the overall process economics, the understanding and the description of the complex network of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions involved in CH4 thermal cracking and, in particular, in the formation of valuable carbon and of undesired byproducts (carbon nanoparticles) is key to technology design and operations. In this work we present a systematic experimental study of pure methane cracking in a tubular quartz reactor in the temperature range T = 875–975 °C at initial flow rates QCH4,0 = 30, 45 and 60 ml/min. CH4 conversion and H2 yields have been measured quantitatively and complemented with the identification of key aromatic precursors supporting the interpretation of the mechanistic phenomena aided by an existing chemical kinetic model and chemical kinetic analyses. A careful analysis of the carbon products allowed to explore the different morphologies of deposited carbon and carbon nanoparticles in the gas phase, as well as their strong dependence from homogeneous gas-phase reactivity, motivating further model developments aimed to describe currently missing complex heterogeneous reaction pathways towards a quantitative description of the observed features.
