Seashell waste reforming suppresses oxygen evolution to produce carbon-negative hydrogen and sustainable single-cell protein While alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is a promising route for green hydrogen production, it typically relies on mined materials and is hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits efficiency and poses explosion risks. Seashell waste (SSW), rich in calcium carbonate yet often discarded, offers a bio-based alternative to traditionally unsustainably mined limestone. Integrating SSW into AWE while overcoming OER challenge remains underexplored. Here, we introduce a solar-powered electro-bioprocess, which produces cost-competitive and life-cycle carbon-negative hydrogen (−2.23 kg CO2-eq. kg−1 H2), at the rate of ∼14 L h−1, with a ∼10% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Mechanistic studies identify Ni3+ as the key species to C–C bond cleavage via electrophilic oxygen intermediates, enabling an SSW oxidation reaction with 83%–88% Faraday efficiency that suppressed OER. Additionally, over 96% of organic carbon is recovered, with >70% converted into high-value single-cell protein. This scalable system offers a circular solution for sustainable energy and nutrient recovery.
