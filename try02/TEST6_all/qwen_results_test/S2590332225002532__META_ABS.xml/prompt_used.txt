You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Seashell waste reforming suppresses oxygen evolution to produce carbon-negative hydrogen and sustainable single-cell protein While alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is a promising route for green hydrogen production, it typically relies on mined materials and is hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which limits efficiency and poses explosion risks. Seashell waste (SSW), rich in calcium carbonate yet often discarded, offers a bio-based alternative to traditionally unsustainably mined limestone. Integrating SSW into AWE while overcoming OER challenge remains underexplored. Here, we introduce a solar-powered electro-bioprocess, which produces cost-competitive and life-cycle carbon-negative hydrogen (−2.23 kg CO2-eq. kg−1 H2), at the rate of ∼14 L h−1, with a ∼10% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Mechanistic studies identify Ni3+ as the key species to C–C bond cleavage via electrophilic oxygen intermediates, enabling an SSW oxidation reaction with 83%–88% Faraday efficiency that suppressed OER. Additionally, over 96% of organic carbon is recovered, with >70% converted into high-value single-cell protein. This scalable system offers a circular solution for sustainable energy and nutrient recovery.
