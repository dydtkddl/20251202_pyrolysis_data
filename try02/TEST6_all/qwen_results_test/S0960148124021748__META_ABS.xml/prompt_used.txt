You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Batch rolling-bed dryer applicability for drying biomass prior to torrefaction This study investigates the suitability of a pilot-scale batch rolling-bed dryer for drying pine wood chips intended for torrefaction. The batch rolling bed dryer emerges as an ideal solution for further processes like torrefaction, offering a compact design and a wide range of operational parameters. Compared to rotary dryers, it occupies less volume, providing greater efficiency. Additionally, its adjustable drying airflow and compatibility with various biomass forms and particle sizes enhance its versatility. The volumetric evaporation rate was found 13.9 kg/m3 per hour for the total dryer volume and 78.8 kg/m3 for the bed volume. Mechanical tests demonstrate satisfactory operation, with potential for further optimization through impeller blade design improvements. The study also presents a simple model using the CDC modeling approach, successfully describing drying curves in most experiments, albeit with some limitations in temperature curve simulations. Overall, the rolling bed dryer proves to be a convenient solution for drying wood chips as a pretreatment for steam torrefaction, offering ease of operation and promising potential for application in continuous torrefaction lines.
