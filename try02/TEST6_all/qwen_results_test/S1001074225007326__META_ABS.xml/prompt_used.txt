You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Screening of typical pollutants in groundwater polluted by nitrogen heterocyclic pesticides and removal mechanism of iron-doped biochar Pesticide-contaminated sites often contain high concentrations of pollutants, including various unknown nitrogen heterocyclic compounds. Effectively treating pesticide-contaminated groundwater poses a significant challenge. Identifying these unknown pollutants and strategically designing materials in a targeted manner offers insights for groundwater remediation. This study employed liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to analyze groundwater pollutants from pesticide-contaminated sites. Non-targeted screening techniques were adopted to identify and prioritize pollutants for treatment. The critical pyrolysis parameters of sawdust biochar doped with iron (Fe) prepared through a one-step pyrolysis method were evaluated. A total of 36 pollutants were identified via non-targeted screening. Among these, 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB) and 2-hydroxybenzimidazole (2-HB), with concentrations of 214.95 mg/L and 286.57 mg/L, respectively, were selected as the target pollutants due to having the highest concentrations. The biochar prepared with a sawdust-to-iron weight ratio of 5:1 and processed at 800°C (BC5-Fe-800) achieved the best removal rates: 100 % for 2-AB and 99.89 % for 2-HB in the pesticide-contaminated groundwater and 99.49 % chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate. Analysis using FT-IR spectra, XRD patterns, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the main adsorption mechanisms of the iron-doped biochar were electrostatic adsorption, π-π interaction, hydrogen bonding, surface complexation, and hydrophobic partitioning. BC5-Fe-800 exhibited high reusability, maintaining over 95 % removal efficiency for 2-AB and 2-HB after five consecutive regeneration cycles. This study successfully identified and treated pollutants in pesticide-contaminated groundwater, providing a reliable solution for treating water bodies with high concentrations of complex pollutants.
