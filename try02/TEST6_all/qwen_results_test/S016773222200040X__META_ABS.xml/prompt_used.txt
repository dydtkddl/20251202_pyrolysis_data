You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanoscale layered double hydroxide modified hybrid nanomaterials for wastewater treatment: A review Wastewater treatment has been a major challenge for scientific society due to complex nature of wastewater and increased demand of clean water supply. In this review, we have critically examined the progress made in development of nanoscale layered double hydroxide (LDH) based hybrid nanomaterials for the treatment of different kind of environmental pollutants present in wastewater. Broad analyses on synthesis of LDH nanomaterials through various routes and their modification by carbon nanotubes, graphene oxides, graphitic carbon nitrides, and magnetic nanomaterials have been given. A survey on characterization tools like XRD, SEM-EDS, TEM, FTIR, XPS, TGA-DTA, and BET surface area are also given. Applications of LDH based hybrid nanomaterials for the cleaning of wastewater containing heavy metals, dyes, antibiotics, phosphates, pharmaceuticals, and other organic compounds have been critically discussed. Role of solution pH, temperature, and co-existing ions as operating parameters were examined and a remediation mechanism towards LDH and pollutants interaction have been drawn. Application of LDH nanomaterials for real wastewater system has been evaluated. An analysis of recycling and regeneration of LDH nanocomposites have been also compiled. Although LDH based hybrid nanomaterials have been used in every spheres of wastewater remediation, yet, there are some major issues like application in multi-pollutant system, remediation of emerging contaminants such as harmful hormones, enhancement of surface area, and inactivation of harmful microorganisms still needs to be solved. Further attention is needed in the low-cost synthesis of LDHs based nanocomposites so it can be easily applied in the real wastewater systems.
