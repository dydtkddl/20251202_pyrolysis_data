You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An overview on the recycling of waste ground tyre rubbers in thermoplastic matrices: Effect of added fillers The increasing generation and accumulation of waste tyres threaten the ecosystem. Waste tyre landfills create potential fire hazards, environmental pollutions, and threats to human health, as waste tyre pileups harbour rodents, mosquitoes and reptiles, generating harmful diseases. Moreover, there is a great economic loss associated with the disposal of waste tyre rubbers. Therefore, this approach is not sustainable, making the recycling of waste tyre rubber necessary. Accordingly, several recycling strategies are being developed to obtain value-added waste tyre rubber. One of such strategies, which is of environmental conservative and consumes an appreciable quantity of the waste tyres, is the blending of thermoplastics with ground tyre rubber (GTR). However, achieving homogenous dispersion of GTR in matrix poses a great challenge owing to little or no affinity between GTR and thermoplastics. To overcome this problem, surface treatments of GTR, compatibilizers, additives, and energy treatments are used. Most recently, incorporation of rigid nanoparticles with or without combination of other techniques are adopted to facilitate GTR dispersion. In this review, we discuss the recycling of GTR in thermoplastic matrices. Specific attention was paid to the effect of fillers, and more particularly nanofillers, on the dispersion of GTR within thermoplastic matrices for achieving competitive materials.
