You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In situ construction of 3-dimensional hierarchical carbon nanostructure; investigation of the synthesis parameters and hydrogen evolution reaction performance Hierarchical 3-dimensional (3D) carbon nanostructures have potential applicability in several electrochemical energy applications own to their sizeable effective surface, specific energy density, cycling stability and flexibility. Herein, combining electrospinning with in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies as an efficient and secure procedure is applied for constructing 3D carbon nanostructure-based on carbon fibers (CFs) and electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNFs). Affect the catalysis type, immersion solution, carbon sources and treat temperature are experimentally demonstrated. Cactus-like 3D carbon nanomaterials are constructed via growth forest-like carbon nanofibers (CNFs) directly on both CNFs and CFs at 900 °C using Ni as a catalyst, cellulose acetate (CA) as carbon source and ethanol-urea as an immersions solution. The Ni/CNFs/ECNFs mat exhibits a large surface area of 342.3 m2 g−1, while just 19.3 m2 g−1 is recorded to Ni/CNFs/CFs. Based on the nano-nonwoven structure and forest-like grown CNFs nanostructure, Ni/CNFs/ECNFs exhibit a favorable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in an alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 88 mV to deliver 10 mV cm−2 current density and Tafel slope of 170 mV dec−1. This work proves the synthesis parameters of 3D hierarchical carbon nanostructures and their enticing to apply as an advanced substrate for electrochemical applications.
