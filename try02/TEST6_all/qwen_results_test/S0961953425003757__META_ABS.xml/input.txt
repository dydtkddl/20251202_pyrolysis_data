Recent developments on ethyl levulinate as a promising bio-based transportation fuel Ethyl levulinate is an oxygenated fuel derived from biomass, offering significant advantages in reducing engine emissions and enhancing performance. Therefore, deeply understanding its production technologies and practical engineering applications is essential for enhancing its use and scalability in clean energy systems. This paper examines ethyl levulinate market trends, economic viability, production systems, engineering applications, and environmental and health impacts to understand its recent science and technology advancement, and its production and application limitations that require immediate attention. Significant advancements have been achieved in ethyl levulinate production; however, optimizing reactor systems, catalytic processes, and feedstock pretreatment remains critical for commercially viable and high-output synthesis. Laboratory-scale developments show promising results, but industrial-scale production is still scarce. Therefore, to facilitate the commercialization of ethyl levulinate, additional research and development (R&D), supportive policies, and increased investment are required. Ethyl levulinate reduces harmful pollutants and improves engine performance, though more testing is required under optimal conditions. Toxicological studies suggest potential health and environmental impacts, but additional research is necessary.
