You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing infrastructure resilience: A polymeric composite reinforcement grid with self-sensing and self-heating capabilities In this study, a novel multifunctional grid-shaped polymeric composite (MGPC) with reinforcing, autonomous strain, stress, and damage sensing and localizing in addition to targeted heating capabilities, has been developed. Distinct from preceding composites, this grid synthesizes these features collectively for the first time and concurrently addresses current challenges in multifunctional composites, such as environmental impact, data reliability, complexity, and production costs. The fabrication process entails 3D printing an electrical circuit with conductive filaments within a polylactic acid (PLA) host polymer. The conductive filament was composed of a thermoplastic polymer (TPU) infused with carbon nanotubes (CNT)-grafted carbon fibres (CFs) produced via chemical vapour deposition. The mechanical, microstructural, and electrical properties of the grid elements and cementitious slabs reinforced with MGPC were comprehensively examined. The MGPC's performance in traffic flow monitoring, mechanical behaviour prediction, and damage localization was assessed through wheel tracking, asymmetric punch tests, piezoresistivity response evaluation, and digital image correlation techniques. Furthermore, the self-warming ability of the MGPC in cementitious composites was investigated using different voltages. The extruded TPU containing CNT-grafted CFs exhibited an electrical percolation threshold of approximately 5.0 wt%, resulting in a conductivity of around 70 S/m for the filaments. Incorporating MGPC as reinforcement within cementitious composite slabs led to notable enhancements, with flexural strength increasing by approximately 15 % and failure strain by up to 350 %. Wheel tracking tests revealed changes in the electrical: 5.8 % for 520 N and 7.8 % for 700 N wheel loads, with roughly 5.0 % average error in velocity detection. Transverse elements precisely detected wheel locations demonstrating the MGPC capabilities in accurately detecting wheel speed weight, and location. The study established strong correlations between electrical resistance changes, mechanical behaviour, and damage detection, affirming the MGPC's reliability and efficacy for damage monitoring and localization. The cementitious slab reinforced with MGPC reached around 52°C through a 20 V direct current, with a heating rate of 0.25°C/s and a power density of 142 W/m², showing its potential for practical applications such as self-healing and de-icing. However, design parameters such as mesh and conductive circuit configuration, long-term performance, as well as Life Cycle Assessment need further investigation.
