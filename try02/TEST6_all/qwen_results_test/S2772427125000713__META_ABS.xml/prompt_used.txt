You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing bio-hydrogen and biogas yields through optimized ultrasonic pretreatment of algal biomass for sustainable energy production Algae are a promising resource for sustainable energy production, including biogas and bio-hydrogen. This study investigates the effect of ultrasonic (US) pretreatment on Enteromorpha algae to enhance biogas yields. Using response surface methodology (RSM), three key parameters—sonication time, amplitude, and liquid-to-solid ratio—were optimized, with cumulative biogas production as the response. The optimal conditions (5 min sonication, 30 % amplitude, 20:1 liquid-to-solid ratio) resulted in a maximum cumulative biogas production of 373 ml and a bio-hydrogen yield of 32.7 % (v/v). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed significant cell wall disruption, enhancing substrate availability for microbial digestion. However, prolonged sonication reduced yields due to inhibitory effects. Kinetic modeling with Modified Gompertz and Logistic Function models demonstrated faster reaction rates and higher production potentials for pretreated samples. This study highlights the potential of US pretreatment for improving the biodegradability of algae, offering an efficient and sustainable method for bioenergy production.
