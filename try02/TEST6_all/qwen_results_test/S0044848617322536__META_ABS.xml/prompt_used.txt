You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of sludges produced from two different recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) for recycle and disposal Sludges from Submerged Biofilter (SBF) and Aerobic Three Phase Airlift Fluidized Bed Reactor with Circulation in Concentric Tubes (AAFBR-CT) wastewater treatment of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. It was considered a microstructural analysis by SEM-EDX and XRD to identify the sample composition. SBF and AAFBR-CT sludge, presented three stages for both combustion and pyrolysis. The first stage to 180 °C was characterized by loss of water, low-stability organic compounds, the second stage, between 235 °C and 385 °C was characterized by decomposition of carbohydrate, lipids, and proteins. The third stage, between 420 °C and 540 °C represents a decomposition of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids and amino groups. This sludge had a high ash content and is not viable to use for energy purposes. Presence of granular material was revealed by SEM. XRD analysis only identified SiO2. The sludges generated by RAS could be used in brick and ceramic manufacture, adsorbent material or for phosphorus recovery.
