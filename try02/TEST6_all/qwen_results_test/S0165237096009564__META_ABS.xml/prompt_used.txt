You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent trends in analytical and applied pyrolysis of polymers The latest works are reviewed on analytical and applied pyrolysis of polymers, copolymers and blends. Improved identification, component analysis and structural elucidation were performed on several new polymers and copolymers. Various additives, catalysts and residual oligomers were analysed in plastics and the emission of toxic compounds under pyrolysis and combustion were monitored. The development of analytical pyrolysis methods (pyrolysis on line coupled to gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and/or infrared spectroscopy) is closely related to the advances in instrumental chemical analysis and to their combination possibilities. Publications on applied pyrolysis are concerned with the conversion of polymeric precursors into high performance materials (e.g. carbon fibers and ceramics) and the production of useful chemicals (e.g. monomers or fuels) from polymer wastes. In both analytical and applied pyrolysis, knowledge about the chemical reactions taking place is essential. Recent studies on the thermal decomposition mechanism of polyolefins, polystyrenes, acryl polymers, polyesters, polyethers, formaldehyde resins, polyamides, sulfur-and silicon-containing polymers are critically reviewed.
